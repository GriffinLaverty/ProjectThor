### About VAR Capability


For power to flow continuously and reliably, ISO New England must ensure that voltage on the transmission system is maintained within an acceptable range at all times. Voltage is regulated through reactive power production and consumption, and resources on the grid may be compensated for providing this reactive power capability. ([See the Voltage Support page](https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/voltage-support).) Voltage\-ampere reactive (VAR) is the unit of measurement for reactive power.

9," Maintaining Power System Reliability Amid Change
------------------------------------------------


Among [ISO New England’s responsibilities](https://www.iso-ne.com/about/what-we-do) as a Regional Transmission Organization is ensuring that the power system continues to operate reliably as conditions on the grid change. Ensuring the continued reliability of the transmission system requires a thorough review from numerous perspectives identified below, pursuant to Attachment K of the [Open Access Transmission Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff/oatt) (Section II of the ISO Tariff).



[### Reliability Transmission


Reliability Transmission ensures that system reliability criteria set by NERC, NPCC, and ISO New England are met. This includes assessments of transmission system reliability and solutions developed through the Solutions Study process or the competitive transmission process. Materials include study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/reliability-transmission)
[### Market Efficiency Transmission


Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades (METUs) are upgrades identified by ISO New England to provide a net reduction in total production cost when the cost to supply system load exceeds the cost of the transmission upgrade. Evaluation criteria include study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/met)
[### Competitive Transmission


When Needs Assessments reveal a non\-time\-sensitive reliability need, or when Market Efficiency or Public Policy needs are identified, ISO\-NE conducts a Request For Proposal (RFP) process to find competitive solutions to solve these needs](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/competitive-transmission)
[### Public Policy Transmission


Transmission requirements to meet public policy goals are met through a competitive RFP process. Materials associated with this process include stakeholder input on public policy requirements, study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/public-policy-transmission)
[### Longer\-Term Transmission Studies


NESCOE\-requested transmission studies performed to identify high\-level concepts of transmission infrastructure that could meet a New England state’s energy policy, mandate, or legal requirement based on state\-identified scenarios and timeframes, which may extend beyond the five\-to\-ten year planning horizon](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/longer-term-transmission-studies)
[### Proposed Plan Applications

### Data


[See ISO Express](https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/iso-express) for a large selection of real\-time and historical ISO data and reports that can help market participants make informed decisions, such as [Schedule 2—VAR Annual Capacity Cost Rate Report](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/billing/-/tree/schedule-2---var-annual-capacity-cost-rate-report) and [Schedule 2—VAR Status Summary Reports](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/billing/-/tree/schedule-2---var-status-summary-reports).


### About Voltage and Reactive Control


For electricity to continuously and reliably flow, the ISO must ensure that voltage on the transmission system is maintained within an acceptable range at all times. Voltage is regulated through reactive power dispatch, and resources on the grid may be compensated for providing this reactive power capability. VAR (voltage\-ampere reactive) is the unit of measurement for reactive power.


### Rules and Resources

Industry Standards, Structure, and Relationships
================================================


ISO New England is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which defines our authority, responsibilities, and the services we provide in New England. FERC’s mandated or approved rules are detailed in the [*ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff*](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff) (the ISO tariff). The tariff also outlines the FERC\-approved revenues the ISO collects for its services and sets out the cost recovery and allocation mechanisms for transmission and ancillary services in the region. In conjunction with the ISO’s [Transmission Operating Agreements](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/governing-agreements/transmission-operating-agreements), the ISO tariff helps satisfy FERC requirements for the ISO’s functioning as a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).

RTOs and ISOs
-------------


The ISO is one of nine RTOs and Independent System Operators (ISOs) in North America. FERC created us as an ISO in 1997\. While “ISO” remains part of our name, FERC designated us an RTO in 2005\. ISOs and RTOs share many core principles and functions in operating regional grids, running wholesale markets, and power system planning. One of the main differences in operating as an RTO is that ISO New England has broader authority over the operation of the transmission system. [See FERC Order No. 2000](https://ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/RM99-2-00K_1.pdf) for details.

### About the ISO’s Cost\-Allocation Review


The ISO’s responsibilities as Regional Transmission Organization include Transmission Cost Allocation (TCA). That means deciding who pays for regulated (not merchant) transmission projects, in a collaborative and transparent process, as follows:


1. Transmission owners (TOs) submit a TCA application for projects that qualify for regional rate recovery.
2. The ISO reviews all costs proposed to be included in the regional rate, pursuant to the [ISO Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff). Along with deciding whether regional cost support is justified, the ISO will consider whether costs are reasonable and in accordance with good utility practice.
3. The ISO seeks and considers advisory input from the [Reliability Committee](https://www.iso-ne.com/committees/reliability/reliability-committee) on potential localized costs associated with the project. For larger projects, an open stakeholder meeting may be held at the ISO’s discretion.
4. The ISO makes a determination of whether the project costs should be regionalized and/or localized:
* **Regionalized costs**—Projects that will improve reliability throughout the region provide a benefit for all of New England, and their costs are shared by the region. A region’s share of the costs is proportionate to its electricity demand.
* **Localized costs**—Portions of a project that do not provide a regional reliability benefit are typically the responsibility of the transmission owner. Examples of localized costs can be found in Attachment A of Planning Procedure 4\.

 1.0 Purpose

This document outlines a data collection process by which Distribution Providers (which, for the purposes of
this Planning Procedure, are defined as the entities to which DERs connect) and/or Transmission Owners
submit data on installed Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to ISO New England. For the purposes of this
Planning Procedure, DER refers any generator or energy storage facility located on the distribution system,
any subsystem thereof, or behind a customer meter that is capable of providing energy injection, energy
withdrawal, regulation or demand reduction.[1] Examples of these DER facilities are: solar photovoltaic
generation (either behind a retail customer’s meter or as a stand-alone facility connecting directly to the
distribution system), wind, hydroelectric, combined heat and power, fuel cells, battery energy storage
systems, or hybrid facilities containing multiple technologies at a single location. The boundary of a DER
facility is considered the point of common coupling between the facility’s equipment and the Distribution
Provider.

In light of the large number and cumulative capacity of these resources on New England’s power system, ISO
New England collects basic data on these facilities (size, physical location, electrical location, type, in-service
date, and other characteristics) for use in many applications. This data is used as an input to both long- and
short-term load forecasts, power system modeling, transmission planning and transmission service studies,
operational studies, and the Energy Management System, among other uses. Availability of this data leads to
more accuracy in planning and operating the transmission system, as well as more efficient outcomes of
these processes.

#### 2.0 Applicable Entities

This Planning Procedure is applicable to the following types of entities:

  - **ISO New England: As the Planning Coordinator and Reliability Coordinator for the New England area,**
ISO New England leads the process for DER data collection. ISO New England distributes the initial
request three times per year, screens submissions for conformance with the data format, and sends
inquiries to Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners as necessary to resolve any missing or
conflicting data.

  - **Distribution Providers:[2]** As the entities to which DERs connect, Distribution Providers are responsible
for providing facility-level data to ISO New England for all DERs connected to their system.

  - **Transmission Owners: Transmission Owners are responsible for providing data used to translate**
feeders in the Distribution Providers’ data into locations identified in various frameworks used by ISO

1 Generation or storage facilities that are used solely to provide backup power when a customer is disconnected from the
distribution system, and do not inject or discharge power when synchronized with the distribution system, are not considered
DER for the purposes of this Planning Procedure. Data does not need to be submitted to ISO-NE for these facilities.

2 For the purposes of this planning procedure, a “Distribution Provider” is defined as operating the “wires” between the
transmission system and the end-use customer. The term is not defined by a specific voltage, but rather as performing the
distribution function at any voltage. Note that while this definition is similar to NERC’s definition of the same term (see NERC
[Glossary of Terms, https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf), the definition of](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf)
Distribution Provider for the purposes of this Planning Procedure is not dependent on the Distribution Provider’s peak load
served, in contrast to NERC’s use of a minimum size threshold for NERC registration purposes.


-----

#### g g Distributed Energy Resources

New England, including PSS®E bus numbers and substation identifiers used in the Energy
Management System and market applications.

Upon mutual agreement between a Distribution Provider and a Transmission Owner, either party may submit
the data required in this procedure on behalf of the other.

#### 3.0 Data Collection Timeline

The collection of DER data shall occur three times per year, according to the following approximate dates.
Dates may be adjusted as needed to avoid conflicts such as weekends and holidays. Data shall reflect all DER
connected to the Distribution Provider’s system on the date listed in the second row of the table below, as
well as any proposed facilities in the Distribution Provider’s interconnection queue or equivalent list of
interconnection requests on that date.

**Procedure Step** **December Data Collection** **April Data Collection** **August Data Collection**

ISO-NE distributes data December 15 April 15 August 15
request to Distribution
Providers and
Transmission Owners

Submit all DER December 31 April 30 August 31
interconnected and
proposed as of:

Distribution Providers January 21 May 21 September 21
and Transmission
Owners respond to ISONE data request

The first data collection under this procedure will occur in January 2025, and Distribution Providers and
Transmission Owners shall submit data by the January 21 due date. As part of that collection, ISO New
England shall work with data submitters after this date to identify any data quality and data formatting issues,
and these issues may be remedied after the January 21 date. For all subsequent data collections under this
procedure, Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners shall submit data in the proper format by the
dates listed in last row of the table above.

#### 4.0 Data Collection Process

 4.1 Initial Request from ISO New England

ISO New England shall request data from Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners according to the
schedule above. Along with the issuance of the data request, ISO New England shall provide a copy of the
most recent version of the feeder information table in Appendix B to this Planning Procedure to each
Transmission Owner, as a starting point for their submission(s).

|Procedure Step|December Data Collection|April Data Collection|August Data Collection|
|---|---|---|---|
|ISO-NE distributes data request to Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners|December 15|April 15|August 15|
|Submit all DER interconnected and proposed as of:|December 31|April 30|August 31|
|Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners respond to ISO- NE data request|January 21|May 21|September 21|

 4.2 Distribution Provider Submissions

Each Distribution Provider shall submit the best available[3] data for each DER facility connected to its system.
This data shall be submitted in the format given in Appendix A to this Planning Procedure. Data shall be
submitted for existing DER as well as any proposed facilities in the Distribution Provider’s interconnection
queue or equivalent list of interconnection requests. When a DER has been disconnected from the
distribution system or retired, the Distribution Provider shall include the facility in the following data
submission, with a status of “Retired.” Inclusion of retired DERs in subsequent submissions is at the discretion
of the Distribution Provider.

All DERs shall be included in this data submission, regardless of size, type, or other characteristics. Facilities
that are already modeled generator assets in ISO-NE systems need not be included, but may be included at
the discretion of the Distribution Provider. These modeled generator assets are explicitly modeled in ISO New
England’s Energy Management System and market systems. ISO New England shall account for any overlap
between DER data submissions and modeled generators when processing Distribution Providers’ data
submissions.

#### 4.3 Transmission Owner Submissions

Each Transmission Owner shall submit data describing the electrical location of each feeder listed in the
Distribution Provider’s submission, according to the format given in Appendix B of this Planning Procedure.

#### 4.4 ISO New England Receipt and Validation of Data

Following the submission of data from each Distribution Provider and Transmission Owner, ISO New England
shall review the data, and return any data determined to be invalid, conflicting, or unclear to the appropriate
party for review and revision if necessary. In addition, any new feeders listed in the Distribution Provider’s
data shall be submitted to the Transmission Owner, so that data can be provided to ISO-NE for the new
feeder according to Appendix B of this Planning Procedure.

#### 5.0 Revision History

 Rev. 0 Approved: RC – 7/16/24; NPC – 8/1/24; ISO-NE – 8/14/24

3 The data request as part of this procedure may be compiled from Distribution Providers’ interconnection queues or similar
records, and it is understood that some details (such as in-service dates, maximum DC generation for solar facilities, or installed
energy capacity for storage facilities) may change as a project is developed and constructed. ISO New England’s expectation is
that distribution providers will provide the most up-to-date information available to them, and there is no requirement for
distribution providers to conduct field verification of these quantities, or to retroactively provide unavailable data for
previously interconnected facilities.

**Appendix 1 – Data Considerations for GMD Analysis**

**General Modeling Data Instructions**

This Appendix provides an overview of the type of modeling data necessary to model and study
GMD on the New England Transmission system. Not all applicable entities will be required to
provide data from every equipment category outlined in this Appendix. Each TO or Lead MP
will be required to provide relevant modeling data for the equipment it is responsible for. As an
example, a Lead MP representing a GO that owns only a generator step up transformer with a
high side, wye-grounded winding with terminal voltage greater than 200 kV for interconnecting
a particular generation plant (but does not own a transmission line or substation) will be required
to provide modeling data only for the generator step up transformer.

Additional technical details for the modeling data requirements in this Appendix can be found in:

     - NERC’s “Application Guide Computing Geomagnetically-Induced Current in the
_Bulk-Power System,” which is available at:_
[http://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Geomagnetic%20Disturbance%20Task%20Force%2](http://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Geomagnetic%20Disturbance%20Task%20Force%20GMDTF%202013/GIC%20Application%20Guide%202013_approved.pdf)

[collection-white-paper.pdf](https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/library/publications/other/npcc-gic-data-collection-white-paper.pdf)

Modeling data for all relevant equipment owned by the same entity must be submitted in a single
standardized Excel file. Appendix 2 includes a link to the standardized Excel file that specifies
all of the GIC modeling data parameters needed to perform a GMD assessment.

Below are descriptions of some key parameters required for creating the GMD models. Note that
some Lead MPs may not have access to certain data, such as PSS®E bus numbers and ID data
points for a particular facility. In those cases, the Lead MP will work directly with the ISO to
coordinate the exchange of such modeling data.

**Substation and Bus Data**

The substation data necessary to complete the analysis includes:

a. Substation Number (I): if the substation has multiple bus numbers in the PSS®E
power flow base case, then the lowest bus number of the highest voltage level in the
base case must be used. For example, the Orrington substation comprises multiple
voltage levels. For the Orrington substation, the lowest 345 kV bus number used in
the PSS®E power flow base cases would be used as the Orrington substation number.

b. List of Buses: a correlation between buses in the PSS®E power flow base case and
their corresponding substation is needed to perform GMD studies. For each

6


-----

Support Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis

substation, each applicable entity should provide a list PSS®E power flow bus
numbers that comprise the substation. Buses connected via zero impedance lines,
two-winding, or three-winding transformers are considered by the GIC analysis to be
part of the same substation.

c. Substation Name (NAME): the name may be up to twelve characters, and the actual
substation name, e.g. ORRINGTON, should be used.

d. Substation Geographic Latitude and Longitude in Degrees (LATITUDE,
LONGITUDE): this data is used to calculate the length of branches that connect
between substations, and the resulting applied GMD voltage. Such coordinate data
must be cross-checked with the corresponding coordinate data in the NX-9
application, and any needed corrections must be submitted to the ISO by the
applicable entity (i.e. TO or a Lead MP for a GO) using the NX-9 application.

e. Substation Grounding DC Resistance in Ohms (RG): this data is needed to calculate
the geomagnetically induced current flowing from the various elements connected to
a substation into the substation’s ground. The grounding resistance of the substation
can be obtained by direct measurement.

Information for border buses should be included. Border buses are the artificial buses
used in the PSS®E power flow cases to identify the borders of a transmission line owned
by different entities. Border buses connected to substation buses through zero impedance
branches will assume the coordinates of the substation. Other border buses will be
represented by artificial substations to assign them coordinates. Border buses shall have a
substation grounding DC resistance value of 99.0 Ω to represent them as ungrounded
substations. Use the same naming convention that the border buses currently used in the
PSS®E power flow base case.

Information on taps or switching stations shall also be included. A bus with no grounded
equipment and that is not connected to a substation via zero impedance line(s) is
considered a tap or switching station. Taps or switching stations shall have a substation
grounding DC resistance value of 99.0 Ω to represent them as ungrounded substations.

**Transformer Data**

The complete modeling of transformers requires a series of data that is not found in the
data used in power flow studies. The most common place to find this information is the
manufacturer’s transformer test report. Refer to NERC’s “Application Guide Computing
_Geomagnetically-Induced Current in the Bulk-Power System” for additional technical_
explanation of the DC model of transformers and the individual data points required. Key
parameters for transformer GMD models include:

a. DC Resistance of Winding 1, 2, and 3 (for 3 Winding Transformers) (WRI, WRJ,
WRK): these parameters are specified at nominal tap, in Ohms/Phase at 75 °C.

7


-----

Support Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis

b. Grounding DC Resistance of Winding 1, 2, and 3 (for 3 Winding Transformers) in
Ohms (GRDWRI, GRDWRJ, GRDWRK).

c. Presence of GIC Blocking Device in Neutral of Winding 1, 2 or 3(GICBDI, GICBDJ,
GICBDK): this parameter is used to specify if a GIC blocking device is present in the
neutral windings of a transformer.

d. Vector Group (VECGRP): this parameter is used to specify the transformer winding
grounding connections and phase angles.

e. Number of Cores (CORE): this parameter is used to specify the number of cores in a
transformer.

f. KFACTOR: this factor is used to calculate transformer reactive power loss from GIC
flowing through its winding (MVAR/AMP).

g. Transformer Model (TMODEL): this identifier is used to define the configuration of a
transformer (e.g. two-winding/three-winding/auto transformer or a T model in DC
network).

Note: Explicit three-winding transformer models must be provided for three winding
transformers. The modeling of three-winding transformers as three two-winding
transformers is not acceptable. Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Numbers and
IDs for three-winding transformers included with any provided GIC modeling data match
the corresponding bus numbers and IDs used in the PSS®E power flow network data.

**Fixed Shunt Data**

Similar to transformers, fixed shunt reactors provide a path to ground for neutral currents
in the case of a GMD event. Key data includes:

a. PSS®E power flow Bus Number (I): the bus number to be included in the GMD
modeling information that matches the number currently shown in the PSS®E power
flow network data.

b. PSS®E power flow Shunt Identifier (ID): the shunt identifier that matches the
identifier currently shown in the PSS®E power flow network data.

c. DC Resistance at 75 °C in Ohms/Phase (R).

d. Grounding DC Resistance in Ohms at 75 °C (RG).

Note: Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Number matches the number used in
the power flow network data and that the ID matches the ID used in the power flow
network data.

Support Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis

**Branch Data**

The branch resistance is used, together with the branch length, to calculate the magnitude
of the geomagnetically induced current. This data can be calculated from the conductor’s
manufacturer specification sheet. Please refer to NERC’s “Application Guide Computing
_Geomagnetically-Induced Current in the Bulk-Power System” for further technical_
guidance. The key data for the GMD modeling of Branch Data is:

a. Branch DC Resistance in Ohms/Phase (RBRN): the individual phase dc resistance
adjusted to 50 °C, or a technically supported equivalent methodology. PSS®E uses
one third of this individual phase DC resistance in the GIC analysis. Specifying
RBRN information is not required for zero impedance lines. In case of series
capacitors, refer to the NERC Application Guide for further guidance.

b. Branch GMD Induced Electric Field (INDVP, INDVQ): underground cables enclosed
in steel, or other types of ferromagnetic metal casings experience a reduction in GMD
induced voltages but remain paths for GICs to flow; in this case, applicable entities
shall consider providing data for INDVP and INDVQ. However, underground cables
not enclosed in a casing made of ferromagnetic metal will not experience a reduction
in induced geoelectric field and should be treated the same as overhead branches.

Note: Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Number matches the number used in
the power flow network data and that the ID matches the ID used in the power flow
network data.

**Switched Shunt Data**

Switched shunt reactors provide a path to ground for neutral currents in the case of a
GMD event. Key data includes:

a. PSS®E power flow Bus Number (I): the bus number to be included in the GMD
modeling information that matches the number currently shown in the PSS®E power
flow network data.

b. DC Resistance at 75 °C in Ohms/Phase (R).

c. Grounding DC Resistance in Ohms at 75 °C (RG).

Note: Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Number matches the number used in
the power flow network data used in the power flow network data.

**Two-Terminal DC Data**

DC network data must be specified for rectifier and inverter converter stations that are
connected to AC network through converter transformers. Key data includes:

a. DC Line Name (NAME): the name of the DC line that matches the name currently
shown in the PSS®E power flow network data.

9


-----

Support Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis

b. PSS®E power flow Bus Number (I): the bus number of the rectifier or inverter
converter AC bus to be included in the GMD modeling information that matches the
number currently shown in the PSS®E power flow network data.

c. Ground Path Identifier (ID): this is a GIC specific ID (not used in used in PSS®E
power flow network data) to specify more than one ground path at a rectifier or
inverter ac bus.

d. DC Resistance at 75 °C in Ohms/Phase (R) of the grounded winding of converter
transformer.

e. Grounding DC Resistance in Ohms at 75 °C (RG).

Note: Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Number matches the number used in
the power flow network data used in the power flow network data.

**Other Modeling Data**

Other categories of parameters required for creating GMD models include VSC DC Data,
Multi-Terminal DC Data, FACTS Device Data, and Load Data. Modeling data for these
categories should be provided as applicable.

Note: Applicable entities shall verify that the Bus Number matches the number used in
the power flow network data and that, if required, the ID matches the ID used in the
power flow network data.

**GIC Monitor Data**

Obtaining GIC monitor data is useful for model validation and situational awareness.

New GIC monitor installations should be on Applicable BES Power Transformers located in
areas found to have high GIC flows based on system studies. Where possible, sites in the vicinity
of transportation systems using direct current (e.g., subways or light rail) should be avoided
when installing GIC monitors due to the possibility of interference from these systems.

## Electromagnetic Transient Modeling Requirements

### In support of an Interconnection Request (IR) all equipment-level Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) models must be supplied by the respective Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and combined into a plant-level model[1] by the Interconnection Customer (IC). These models must meet the requirements included in this checklist Sections A, B and C. Each checklist must be accompanied with an equipment Model Quality Attestation[2] (e-MQA) that is submitted by the respective OEM. Additionally, for each IR, the IC shall submit a single plant-level Model Quality Attestation (p-MQA)2 above that covers all equipment-level EMT models and other equipment[3] within the plant.

 For the EMT models to be usable by ISO-NE, they must be in a format usable by the PSCAD™/EMTDC™ simulation tool. Any requirement within the checklist that is not met shall be documented with sufficient technical justification and will be subject to review.

#### Model Quality Attestation (MQA)[4]

### Each IR (for which an equipment-level EMT model is provided) must be accompanied by an equipment Model Quality Attestation (e-MQA) from the respective OEM and a plant-level Model Quality Attestation (p-MQA) from the IC. An e-MQA and/or p-MQA shall be provided any time significant changes are made to the model[5] that may affect the performance of the plant. An e-MQA and p-MQA form is provided in Appendix C- 1A and Appendix C-1B.

#### A. Model Accuracy Features [7]

### In order to be sufficiently accurate, the model provided for each facility shall:

#### Requirement Description Y/N Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable

1 Represent the full detailed inner control loop of the power electronics. Models cannot use the
same approximations classically used in transient stability modeling and must fully represent all fast
inner controls, as implemented in the real equipment. Models manually translated block-by-block
from MATLAB or control block diagrams are unacceptable.A full power transistor (e.g. IGBT)
representation is the preferred model. Models must embed the actual hardware code into a PSCAD
component[8].

2 An average source representation is strongly discouraged. However, if an average source
representation is utilized (e.g., switching frequency greater than 40 kHz), it shall maintain full detail
in the inner controls and DC side protection features. Sufficient technical justification must be
provided on the usage of an average source representation.

3 DC side protections, and any current, power or energy limitations that could affect plant ridethrough shall be represented in the model. Modelling the DC side with an ideal voltage source is
not acceptable if such a representation prevents the possibility of protection operation during
external system events.

4 Represent all pertinent control features as they are implemented in the real controls (e.g.
customized PLLs, ride-through controllers, etc.) using actual hardware code.

5 Represent Power Plant Controller (PPC) as implemented in the real controls and represent the
specific controllers used in the plant. This includes automatic voltage regulation, specific
measurement methods, and transitions into and out of ride-through modes among others. Generic
PPC representations are not acceptable.

|Requirement|Description|Y/N|Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable|
|---|---|---|---|
|6|Communication and sample and hold delays between PPC and inverter must be modeled.|||
|7|Represent common plant controller functionality if there are multiple plants using the same technology or multiple technologies (eg. Hybrid BESS/PV). If supplementary or multiple voltage control devices (eg. STATCOM) are included in the plant, these should be coordinated with the PPC.|||
|8|Represent Sub Synchronous Oscillation (SSO) mitigation and/or protection including the ability to enable and disable SSO mitigation/protection, if applicable.|||
|9|Represent shunt capacitor and reactor banks and any dynamic reactive devices. The controls should be modeled if the equipment dynamically responds within 10 seconds following a disturbance.|||

|11|Have all pertinent protections modeled in detail for both balanced and unbalanced fault conditions. Typically, this includes various over-voltage and under-voltage protections (individual phase and RMS), frequency protections, DC bus voltage protections, and overcurrent protection among others. Any protection, which can influence dynamic behavior or plant ride-through in the simulation period (up to 30 second post-disturbance), must be included.|||

#### Requirement Description Y/N Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable

13 Model main power transformer[9] (MPT) and generator step up saturation based upon transformer
test reports available. If such data is not available, reasonable approximate data for transformer
saturation shall be used and documented[10].

14 Include detailed representation of any hardware or software filters for the wind turbine controllers,
if necessary

15 The specific implementation of frequency measurement equipment should be modeled. If actual
equipment model is not available, a smoothed master library FFT or master library PLL shall be
used.

16 Be configured to match planned (or installed) site-specific equipment settings[11]. Any user-tunable
parameters or options must be set in the model to match the equipment at the specific site being
evaluated. It is unacceptable to use default parameters.

#### B. Model Usability Features

### In order to allow study engineers to perform system studies and analyze simulation results, the model provided for each facility shall:

#### Requirement Description Y/N Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable

1 Have pertinent control or hardware options accessible to the user (e.g. adjustable protection
thresholds, real power recovery ramp rates frequency or voltage droop settings, voltage control
response time).Diagnostic flags (e.g. flags to show control mode changes or which protection has
been activated) should be accessible to facilitate analysis and should clearly identify why a model
trips during simulations.

9 The MPT is the power transformer that steps up voltage from the collection system voltage to the nominal transmission/interconnecting system voltage for dispersed power producing resources.

10 Data includes magnetization model, magnetizing current, air-core reactance, knee voltage of winding-limb, loop width and any other relevant information

11 If POI SCR is unknown at the time of model submission, it is recommended to parametrize to a POI level SCR of 3 and X/R of 10 as an approximate representation of a weak system. If studies show a SCR lower than 3, additional model tuning may be

required

|Requirement|Description|Y/N|Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable|
|---|---|---|---|
|2|Be capable of accurately running for a time step of 10 μs or higher and not be restricted to operating at a single time step but within a range (eg. 10μs - 20 μs).Models requiring a smaller time step may mean that the control implementation has not used the interpolation features of PSCAD12 or is using inappropriate interfacing between the model and the larger network. Smaller time step will be considered on a case-by-case basis.|||
|3|Be capable of initializing itself. Models shall initialize and ramp to full output without external input from simulation engineers. Any slower control functions which are included (such as switched shunt controllers or power plant controllers) must also accept initial condition variables if required13.|||
|4|Accept external reference values. This includes real and reactive power reference values (for Q control modes), or voltage reference values (for V control modes) and utilize a single parameter for adjusting real power, and separately, a single parameter for adjusting voltage setpoints. Model must accept these reference variables for initialization, and be capable of changing these reference variables mid-simulation, i.e. dynamic signal references.|||
|5|Allow protection models to be disabled. Many studies result in inadvertent tripping of converter equipment, and the ability to disable protection functions temporarily provides study engineers with valuable system diagnostic information.|||
|6|Allow the active power capacity of the model to be scaled. This is distinct from a dispatchable power order and is used for modeling different plant capacities (e.g. if a portion of the plant is offline).|||
|7|Allow the plant to be dispatched at any output within its operating range. If a minimum output is required, sufficient technical justification shall be provided. This is distinct from scaling a plant from one unit to more than one, and is used for testing plant behavior at various operating points.|||


12 If power transistor switching frequency prevents accurate switching representation at 10 μs using interpolation, an average source approximation may be used. See Section A, Requirement 2 for more details.

13 Note that during the first few seconds of simulation (eg. 0-2 seconds), the system voltage and corresponding terminal conditions may deviate from nominal values due to other system devices initializing, and the model must be able to tolerate these

deviations or provide a variable initialization time.

**GUIDELINES FOR CONDUCTING AND EVALUATING PROPOSED PLAN APPLICATION**
**ANALYSES**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Section I.3.9 Requirement**

Under Section I.3.9 of the Tariff, each Market Participant or Transmission Owner must submit
plans for additions to or changes in facilities that might “have a significant effect on the stability,
reliability or operating characteristics of the Transmission Owner’s transmission system, the
transmission facilities of another Transmission Owner or the system of a Market Participant.”
Section 1 of ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-1, “Procedure for Review of Market
Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans”, describes the process and contains the
procedures to be followed in complying with the stated requirement. Section 1 also summarizes
the information recommended or required for a formal submittal of a Proposed Plan Application.
PP5-1 also contains the Proposed Plan Application forms and description of the information
required.

This PP5-3 guideline is intended to be an aid to both the Market Participant or Transmission Owner
filing a Proposed Plan Application and the committees who evaluate the effects of proposed
additions or changes. To allow opportunity for an orderly and timely review, applicants are
strongly recommended to supply supporting information in accordance with these guidelines with
lead times appropriate for anticipated “Level of Analysis Required” (see PP5-3, Section 3.1.2).
The Market Participant or Transmission Owner must confirm with the ISO that information is
complete prior to formal submittal of its Proposed Plan Application.

**1.2 Using the Guidelines**

These guidelines are structured according to the facility for which an application is required and
by concerns specific to that type of facility. Each section outlines the information to be provided
and the measures used to evaluate the information in determining if the proposed facilities will or
will not have a ""significant adverse effect"" on the stability, reliability or operating characteristics
of the electric power system.

Generating unit operating characteristics and other power supply related concerns are addressed
in Section 2.0 Generating Units – Power Supply Concerns. Since a generating unit can affect
the performance of the integrated generation/transmission bulk power system, the guidelines of
Section 3.0 also apply for generation Proposed Plan Applications.

Transmission facility additions and changes refer to transmission lines and substation equipment
for which Proposed Plan Applications are required, including HVDC terminals and static VAR
compensators and are addressed in Section 3.0 Generating Units and Transmission Facilities –
**Bulk Power System Performance.**

Guidelines for protection and control system changes requiring approval of Proposed Plan
Applications, including Special Protection Systems (SPSs) and Dynamic Control Systems, are

Market Participants or Transmission Owners filing a Proposed Plan Application shall provide all
information requested on the generation Proposed Plan Application, which is Attachment 1 to PP5-1.
Only complete applications will be accepted for review. New units are required to meet specific
criteria, listed below. Non-compliance with the criteria below will be grounds for rejecting the
Proposed Plan Application. A Proposed Plan Application should be rejected if a significant adverse
impact on the existing electric system is identified. The Proposed Plan Application will not be
accepted until it is modified to eliminate the identified negative impact.

a. Both physical and contractual operating characteristics of all units must be reported.
During emergency conditions, including the entire spectrum of load levels from peak to
light load, the most restrictive operating limitations, either physical or contractual will be
used to determine the unit’s operation. Identify the normal and emergency operating
characteristics of the unit from a physical unit characteristic perspective. Also, identify
the contractual operating characteristics, if different. Particular attention should be given
to operating limits (high and low), minimum shut down times, minimum run times, and
start up times.

If unable to complete the NX-12 form, provide a detailed description of the amount of
dispatch control the ISO will have in determining the operation and/or output of the unit.
Indicate when, and how frequently the unit can be reduced to its low limit and/or shut
down during emergency conditions.

Provide information on any constraints due to waste to energy conversion,
primary/secondary steam requirements, or any other physical constraints that determine
operating flexibility.

b. If a new unit is 10 MW or larger, it must be equipped with a functioning turbine governor.

c. The settings for underfrequency relays must comply with NPCC guidelines and be
approved by the host utility.

**3.0 Generating Units and Transmission Facilities - Bulk Power System Performance**

**3.1 Classification and Reporting of Analyses**

This section provides guidance on the bulk power system performance analyses required to support
a generation or transmission Proposed Plan Application. The type of change/addition and its
potential effects on the interconnected system determines the depth of analysis expected in support
of a particular Proposed Plan Application. It defines the levels of analysis expected over the range
of Proposed Plan Applications and guides the applicant to that level best suited to the particular


-----

Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

application at hand. General guidance on performance measures and expectations is provided in
Subsection 2.0. Subsections 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 provide specific details on expected studies.

3.1.1 Areas of investigation

A Proposed Plan Application analysis is expected to demonstrate the impact of the
change/addition on system performance in two transmission-related areas: area
transmission requirements and transmission transfer capabilities. As applicable, the
analysis should demonstrate the impact on the power supply concerns detailed in Section
2.0 above.

Impact on area transmission requirements is investigated by showing that the resultant
system (after the change/addition) has sufficient transmission capacity to serve the area
loads under the conditions noted below and in Planning Procedure 3 “Reliability Standards
for the New England Area Pool Transmission Facilities” (the “Reliability Standards”).
Impact on inter-Area and intra-Area transmission transfer capability should be
demonstrated for the conditions noted below.

3.1.2 Level of analysis required

Four levels of analysis are identified for supporting a particular Proposed Plan Application.
Additional analyses may be requested by the Principal Committees or the ISO. Affected
Entities, [1] in consultation with the ISO, may request analysis necessary to assess the impact
on their respective systems. The levels are defined as follows:

Level 0: A Proposed Plan Application is not required

Level I: A Proposed Plan Application is required for information only; reporting of
study results or analysis is not required

Level II: As appropriate, analyses based on testing such as load flow, short circuit,
transient network analysis (TNA), etc. should address one or both of the
following:
                 - Area Transmission Steady State Assessment (Reference:
Reliability Standards)

                 - Transfer Capability Assessment (Reference: Transmission Planning
Technical Guide Appendix I: Transfer Capability Methodology)

Detailed descriptions will be found in Section 3.3 Steady State Analysis and
Section 3.4 Other Testing.

Level III: As appropriate, the analyses should include Level II testing and should address
one or more of the following:

                   - Area Transmission Stability Assessment (Reference: Reliability
Standards)

1 See ISO New England Planning Procedures No. 5-0, “Procedure for Reporting Notice of Intent to Construct or Change
Facilities in Accordance with Section I.3.9 of the ISO New England Tariff (Proposed Plan Application Procedure)

Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

                   - Dynamic Transfer Capability Assessment (Reference: Transmission
Planning Technical Guide Appendix I: Transfer Capability methodology)

Detailed descriptions will be found in Section 3.3 Steady State Analysis
Section 3.4 Other Testing, and Section 3.5 Stability Analysis.

Section 2.0, Additions or Changes Requiring Proposed Plan Applications, of PP5-1 defines
items that may require Proposed Plan Applications. This list has been expanded and
augmented with a table to guide the Proposed Plan applicant to the appropriate minimum level
of analysis consistent with the proposed addition or change. [2] The table titled Level of Analysis
Guideline is in Attachment 1.

The Proposed Plan applicant first determines the facility and the action applied to the facility
e.g. add, replace, or remove to name a few. Next through a list of questions and thresholds,
the appropriate level of analysis is determined.

It should be noted that the Level of Analysis Guideline table is a guide and ISO-NE may
require a higher level of analysis than the level of analysis determined from the guideline table.

For the more complex Level II analyses and those of Level III, a single scope of work should
be submitted for review by the ISO. This scope should include the items listed in Sections
3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 below: a brief description of the facility changes and a description of the
system representation to be used in the study, including all major assumptions regarding test
conditions for load flow, dynamics and/or other studies. Periodic status reports to the ISO,
summarizing testing and results to date, will assist in completing these complex analyses in a
timely manner.

Based on past analyses, the expected amount of time generally needed from initial submission
of study work to completion of review (and formal submittal of application) is as follows:

Level I: No study work submitted
Level II: 1 to 4 months, depending on complexity
Level III: 3 to 12 months, depending on complexity

3.1.3 Reporting

This section contains guidelines for the content of reports submitted in support of Proposed
Plan Applications. Materials submitted with a Proposed Plan Application must be adequate to
support the proposal. It is recognized that it may be necessary to conduct a Proposed Plan
study using preliminary data describing transmission line and machine parameters. Using
such data implies an obligation to provide more specific information at a later time.

3.1.3.1 Description of Proposed Facility(ies)

2 NERC Standard FAC-002-4, Facility Interconnection Studies, introduces a new term, Qualified Change, which is defined
by ISO-NE as an interconnection of new generation, transmission, or electricity end-user facilities or change of an existing
interconnection of generation, transmission, or electricity end-user facilities that requires Level II or Level III analysis.


-----

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Describe the proposed facilities including how the modified system will be operated
and a brief reason for the proposal.

Provide a map showing geographical location, a one-line diagram of the affected
portion of the power system, and a switching diagram including the proposed facility
and nearby facilities.

3.1.3.2 Description of System Representation Used in Studies

For Level II and III analyses, as appropriate, provide:

3.1.3.2.1 Load flow Studies - Year, season, load level, base interchanges, list of future
facilities represented, source of representation and pertinent test assumptions
as described in Section 3.1.1, Conditions to be Tested (below).

3.1.3.2.2 Dynamics Studies - Source of machine data and other dynamics modeling and
data, load model, special protection systems and other pertinent assumptions
as described in Section 3.5.1, Conditions to be Tested (below).

3.1.3.2.3 Other Testing (transient network analysis, short circuit analysis, etc.) - Source
of representation, including machine data and network equivalents. Other
pertinent test assumptions should be noted where they differ from those
described above for load flow studies.

3.1.3.2.4 Analysis and Reporting of Results
For Level II and III analyses, as appropriate, provide a description of the
baseline performance without the modification, a summary of the tests
conducted with the modification and the resulting system performance in
terms of its conformance to the Reliability Standards. Information of interest
is discussed below in Section 3.3.1.2, 3.3.1.3 and 3.3.1.4 and Section 3.3.2 for
Steady State Analyses, Section 3.5.1.2, 3.5.1.3 and 3.5.1.4 and Section 3.5.2
for Stability Analyses and Section 3.4.0 for Other Testing. This information
should be sufficient to clearly demonstrate system performance without
including exhaustive details of all results.

3.1.3.2.5 Conclusions
Present arguments for approval of application consistent with Section 3.3.3
for steady state analyses, Section 3.5.3 for stability analyses and Section 3.4
for other testing.

**3.2 Evaluation**

The Reliability Committee and the ISO will evaluate a number of aspects of the studies submitted
in support of a Proposed Plan Application. As deemed appropriate by the ISO in accordance with
applicable codes of conduct and confidentiality requirements, including the “ISO New England
Information Policy” in Attachment D of the Tariff, the ISO will consult with Affected Entities
regarding testing and aspects of the proposed plan that are specific to their respective systems.
The evaluation of the acceptability of the proposed changes or additions begins with review of the


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

adequacy and acceptability of testing and test results. The results of tests performed and submitted
in support of proposed additions or changes in facilities should clearly demonstrate compliance
with the desired level of reliability as outlined in the Reliability Standards. The level of
performance expected is intended to: 1) assure the reliability of the overall interconnected system
and minimize the risk of widespread cascading outages due to overloads, instability or voltage
collapse; and 2) demonstrate that the Nuclear Plant Interface Requirements (NPIRs) as
documented in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission
Operations, Attachments C and D, are met. The Reliability Standards establish a minimum design
criteria by outlining representative contingency tests and assessment.

Demonstration of acceptable system performance under the enumerated conditions and
assumptions should be considered the minimum level of compliance. Additional testing,
evaluations or adjustments to assumptions may be deemed necessary to either assure the adequacy
of system performance or to distinguish a sensitivity to one particular condition from a more
general system weakness. The final conclusions and recommendations should be based on the
informed engineering judgment of the Reliability Committee with the objective of assuring that
proposed changes or additions in facilities will not have a significant adverse impact on the
stability, reliability or operating characteristics of the interconnected bulk power system.

Generally, if results of testing indicate that the system is not sufficient to accommodate the
proposed changes or additions in facilities, system reinforcements or other mitigating measures
will be required. These reinforcements or mitigating measures should fully alleviate all adverse
impacts which were introduced by the proposed change or addition.

Occasionally, testing may identify weaknesses in the system prior to introduction of the proposed
change or addition in facilities. The degree to which the proposed change or addition further
degrades the stability, reliability or operating characteristics of the system will be of primary
concern. Where no significant impact is identified, it may be possible to conclude that the
proposed change or addition does not degrade system reliability. This judgment should take into
account the frequency, duration, magnitude and consequences of any conditions where reliability
violations occur both prior to and subsequent to the proposed changes or additions.

**3.3 Steady State Analysis**

It is the responsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting the Proposed
Plan Application to identify the most severe conditions that can reasonably be expected to exist.
It must be demonstrated that under such conditions, the proposed additions or changes will not
have any significant adverse impact upon the reliability or operating characteristics of the bulk
power system; otherwise, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner must propose system
modifications, protection systems and/or operating restrictions on the proposed addition which
will eliminate such adverse impact. Studies demonstrating steady state performance must then
simulate normal conditions as well as conditions that stress the system beyond ""typical""
combinations of load level, generation dispatch and power transfers. Since it is necessary for
supporting studies to reflect conditions expected to exist at the time of a future system
modification, such conditions might include other future facilities with or without Proposed Plan
approval that may be installed by about the same point in the future. Upon request, the ISO will


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

assist the Market Participant or Transmission Owner in identifying reasonably stressed conditions
for testing.

3.3.1 Conditions to be Tested

3.3.1.1 Assumptions

a. Selection of Year or Year(s) to Model - The initial year chosen for study is
normally that of the anticipated system modification. However, the following
matters may need to be considered:

                   - other facilities coming on-line in the same time period; and

                   - other influences in the area, such as changes in contracts.

The Reliability Committee and the ISO will provide guidance in selecting the year(s)
and related conditions to be studied.

b. Source of Base Case - The base case should have its origin from the ISO’s library
of cases, with changes or modifications as necessary.

c. Other Proposed Facilities - Inclusion of planned or proposed facilities in a study
is subject to the status of other Proposed Plan Applications, and the System Impact
Study queue. Consequently each proposed or planned facility must be
individually identified in the scope of the study with the aid of the ISO prior to the
start of the study. Having identified the planned or proposed facilities to include
in the study, the study can be done with either or both of the following approaches:
1) the facility assumed installed in the base condition with tests determining the
sensitivity of system response without the facility, or 2) as not installed in the base
condition, but with sensitivity tests conducted with the facility included. The
Market Participant or Transmission Owner conducting the analysis should judge
which approach is appropriate for the evaluation.

d. Modeling Devices - Models for devices of particular concern, such as HVdc
terminals, are available from the ISO. It is the responsibility of the Proposed Plan
applicant to properly represent these devices where appropriate.

e. Load Level - Disturbances should be studied at peak load levels since they usually
promote more pronounced thermal and voltage response within the New England
Control Area than at other load levels. However, other load levels may be of
interest in a particular analysis. This should be determined and, as appropriate,
additional studies should be conducted.

f. Generation Dispatch - Testing should not be restricted to only typical dispatch;
rather the dispatch(es) should be developed to reasonably test the proposed
additions or changes. For example, for an export condition within the study area,
the dispatch should model the maximum number of fully loaded generators
expected to be in-service unless constrained by the transfer limits of an interface.
For an import condition, unit outages simulated within the study area should
reflect must-run, spinning reserve and minimum reactive support requirements of


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

system operation. All dispatches are subject to review by the ISO. The ISO will
consult with Affected Entities regarding dispatches that are relevant to potential
proposed plan impact on their respective systems.

g. Modeling of Transfer Conditions - Generally, intra-Area transfers will be
simulated at or near their established limits (in the direction to produce ""worst
cases"" results) and sensitivities to inter-Area transfers will be determined as
appropriate. The rationale for maintaining these transfer levels before and after
the addition of the proposed facility should be discussed. The ISO has developed
and maintains a list of intra-Area interfaces used in operations.

3.3.1.2 Baseline Performance

Using the supplied and/or modified library case, testing should be conducted to
determine pre-addition system performance. This testing will:

           - validate the representation of the case used; and

           - establish a baseline of performance from which the direct impact of the proposed
modification can be demonstrated.

3.3.1.3 Contingency Selection

The applicant should develop a specific list of contingencies that comply with each
section of the Reliability Standards which applies, including extreme contingencies.
Additional contingency tests, consistent with those standards may be requested by
ISO.

3.3.1.4 Tests With A Line Out Of Service

Applications for major changes in transmission or generation facilities should
include tests of system performance with selected lines out of service assuming that
the area resources and power flows are adjusted between outages. These tests should
identify and evaluate potential constraints to future system operation.

3.3.2 Results Reporting

The applicant should provide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate
system performance under both normal and stressed conditions. This would include:

3.3.2.1 Summary of load flow tests conducted and their results, with and without the
proposed modifications, showing at a minimum the following information:

           - Load level, generation dispatch and pertinent major interface loadings (both interArea and intra-Area);

          - Contingencies tested;

           - A single summary of lines loaded to 95% or more of their applicable rating;

           - Bus voltages outside a range of .95 to 1.05 p.u.;

           - Interactions with existing special protection systems; and

         - Observed results and related comments, including impact on NPIRs, as
appropriate.


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.3.2.2 Summary of results from any other pertinent testing performed such as the analyses
described in Section 3.4, Other Testing.

3.3.2.3 One line diagrams showing flows and voltages with and without the proposed
changes or additions for the following conditions:

           - Normal generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service;

           - Stressed generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service; and

          - All significant contingency conditions for both normal and stressed generation
dispatch cases.

3.3.2.4 Clear, concise narrative interpreting the above results and leading to the conclusion
that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have no significant adverse effect on
the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.
Also, any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with the
proposed facility should be fully documented and explained.

3.3.3 Steady State Evaluations

Evaluations of steady state analyses submitted in support of Proposed Plan Applications
will be based on the considerations and expectations described in Section 3.2, Evaluation.
Additionally, the two aspects noted below will be of primary concern to the Reliability
Committee and the ISO during their review.

3.3.3.1 Was the analysis conducted according to generally accepted practice?

           - Were assumptions and test conditions as outlined in Section 3.3.1?

           - Were tools and procedures applied properly and were they sufficient to provide a
complete analysis?

3.3.3.2 Do results of the analysis support the conclusion that the change(s) will: 1) result in
no significant adverse effect on the reliability of the bulk power system; and 2) meet
the NPIRs? If the analyses indicated any problem areas, how were they resolved?

In particular, the ISO will review each analysis, and consult with Affected Entities as
necessary, to ensure that all of the applicable conditions specified in the Reliability Standards
are satisfied. The recommendation of the ISO to the Reliability Committee will be based on
the applicant having satisfied the applicable conditions required in the Reliability Standards.

**3.4** **Other Testing**

Studies demonstrating system performance may occasionally require other testing, in addition to
the load flow testing described in Section 3.3 above, to adequately assess the effects of proposed
facility changes or additions on the reliability and operating characteristics of the bulk power
system. The need for this other testing, such as transient network analysis, short-circuit analysis,
and/or reactive power and voltage (Q/V) analysis, depends on the specific project involved. These
three analyses, while dealing with dynamic phenomena, do not involve the detailed time
simulation of a stability analysis; rather, each is a single snapshot of the ability of the power system


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

to withstand events such as loss of components, short-circuits or unanticipated demand. It is the
responsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting the Proposed Plan
Application to consider the need for these tests when preparing the Proposed Plan supporting
analysis and include them as appropriate. The Reliability Committee or the ISO may request any
one or more of these other tests, or in the course of their review of the supporting analysis, may
request other testing not described in this guideline. The ISO will consult, as necessary, with
Affected Entities regarding the need for additional testing relevant to the potential impact of the
proposed plan on their respective systems. Each Market Participant or Transmission Owner that
is a Nuclear Plant Generator Operator is expected to have its Reliability Committee representative
review the reporting of analysis of a proposed plan and request any additional analysis to address
meeting any applicable NPIRs.

3.4.1 Transient Network Analysis (TNA)

Transient Network Analysis studies are typically performed as part of the detailed design
engineering of a project where there may be concern for transient or temporary
overvoltages, voltage flicker, arrester capabilities or insulation coordination. Sudden
changes in circuit conditions, such as switching operations, lightning strikes, sudden loss
of load or inrush currents (e.g., from a cable, capacitor bank or transformer energization or
de-energization) can lead to this type of overvoltage, whose effects are usually confined to
an area localized to the switching station. As such, those projects where this would be a
concern typically include a TNA study as part of the design process but do not usually
include the TNA results as part of the Proposed Plan study.

In those situations where a neighboring Affected Entity is close enough to be potentially
affected (typically no more than two busses away from the switching location), the
applicant and the Affected Entity should engage in a joint review of the base case models
to be used in the TNA study. Then, in the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should
provide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate system performance
under both normal and stressed conditions. This would normally include a summary of
all TNA tests conducted and their results, generally in the form of peak overvoltages or
percent voltage change at selected busses and a clear, concise narrative interpreting these
results and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have
no significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section
I.3.9 of the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated
with the proposed change or addition should be fully documented and explained.

3.4.2 Short-Circuit Analysis

Projects such as the addition of a generator or a transmission element can have a significant
impact on the short-circuit duty at substations in the vicinity of the proposed facilities. For
those projects where this would be a concern, the applicant should include an analysis of
the incremental effects of the project on short-circuit interrupting duty in the vicinity of
the proposed change or addition. In those situations where a neighboring Affected Entity
is close enough to be significantly affected, the applicant and the other Affected Entity(ies)


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

should engage in a joint review of the capabilities of the equipment in the area prior to
submission of the Proposed Plan analysis.

In the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should provide sufficient details and information
to clearly demonstrate system performance with respect to short-circuits. This would
normally include a summary of the short-circuit tests conducted and their results, generally
in the form of duty at selected busses, and a clear, concise narrative interpreting these
results and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have
no significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9
of the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with
the proposed change or addition should be fully documented and explained.

3.4.3 Q/V Analysis

Voltage and reactive power performance of the bulk power system varies according to the
load, transmission and generation in each area. It cannot be predicted system-wide by a
single type of facility change or addition. Rather, the impact on the bulk system of a
particular change or addition is evidenced by a high sensitivity of voltage at key busses in
the system to changes in load, circuit conditions, or reactive compensation. For those
projects where this would be a concern, the applicant should include an analysis of the
effects of the proposed change or addition on the reactive power and voltage performance
of the bulk power system.

In the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should provide sufficient details and information
to clearly demonstrate reactive power support and voltage performance under both normal
and stressed conditions. This would normally include a summary of all tests conducted
and their results, generally in the form of Q/V (or P/V) curves or another measure of
reactive power and voltage margin in the affected area and a clear, concise narrative
interpreting these results and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject
facility(ies) will have no significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as
specified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system
behavior associated with the proposed change or addition should be fully documented and
explained.

**3.5 Stability Analysis**

It is the responsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting a Proposed
Plan Application to identify the most severe conditions that can reasonably be expected to exist.
It must be demonstrated that under such conditions, the proposed additions or changes will not
have any significant adverse impact upon the stability, reliability or operating characteristics of
the bulk power system; otherwise, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner must propose
system modifications, protection systems and/or operating restrictions which will eliminate such
adverse impact. Studies demonstrating dynamic performance must then simulate conditions that
stress the system beyond ""typical"" combinations of load level, generation dispatch and power
transfers. Further, while the dynamic response of an individual proposed generating unit is of
interest, the response of the bulk power system is of primary importance. Since it is necessary for


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

supporting studies to reflect conditions expected to exist at the time of a future system
modification, such conditions might include other future facilities with or without Proposed Plan
approval that may be installed by about the same point in the future. Upon request, the ISO will
assist the Market Participant or Transmission Owner in identifying reasonably stressed conditions
for testing.

3.5.1 Conditions to be Tested

3.5.1.1 Assumptions

a. Selection of Year(s) to Model - The initial year chosen for study is normally that
of the anticipated system modification. However, the following matters may need
to be considered:

            - other facilities coming on-line in the same time period; and

            - other influences in the area, such as changes in contracts.

The Reliability Committee and the ISO will provide guidance in selecting the year
and related conditions to be studied.

b. Source of Base Case(s) - The base case(s) should have its origin from the ISO’s
library of cases, with changes or modifications as necessary.

c. Other Proposed Facilities - Inclusion of planned or proposed facilities in a study
is subject to the status of other Proposed Plan Applications, and the System Impact
Study queue. Consequently each proposed or planned facility must be
individually identified in the scope of the study with the aid of the ISO prior to the
start of the study. Having identified the planned or proposed facilities to include
in the study, the study can be done with either or both of the following approaches:
1) the facility assumed installed in the base condition with tests determining the
sensitivity of system response without the facility, or 2) the facility not installed
in the base condition, but with sensitivity tests conducted with the facility
included. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner conducting the analysis
should judge which approach is appropriate for the evaluation.

d. Modeling Devices - Models for devices of particular concern, such as HVdc
terminals, are available from the ISO. It is the responsibility of the Proposed Plan
applicant to properly represent these devices where appropriate.

e. Load Level - Disturbances should be studied at light load levels since they usually
promote more pronounced dynamic response within the New England Control
Area than at other load levels. However, other load levels may be of interest in a
particular analysis. This should be determined and, as appropriate, additional
studies should be conducted.

f. Generation Dispatch - Testing should not be restricted to only typical dispatch;
rather the dispatch(es) should be developed to test the proposed modification under
stressed conditions. For example, an export condition would be tested by


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

modeling the maximum number of fully loaded generators expected to be inservice in the exporting area unless constrained by the transfer limits of an
interface. This will demonstrate if groups of machines in such areas could
accelerate and lose synchronism with the bulk power system. At the same time, a
""reasonable"" number of units should be dispatched within the importing areas.
These units need not be fully dispatched but they should reflect must-run, spinning
reserve and minimum reactive support requirements of system operation. All
dispatches are subject to review by the ISO. The ISO will consult with Affected
Entities regarding dispatches that are relevant to potential proposed plan impact
on their respective systems.

g. Modeling of Transfer Conditions - Transfer levels should be selected to produce
accentuated dynamic response. Generally, intra-Area transfers will be simulated
at or near their established limits (in the direction to produce ""worst cases"" results)
and sensitivities to inter-Area transfers will be determined as appropriate. The
rationale for choosing particular interface loadings before and after a modification
due to a proposed facility should be discussed. The ISO has developed and
maintains a list of interfaces used in operations.

3.5.1.2 Baseline Performance

Using the supplied and/or modified library case, testing should be conducted to
validate the representation of the case and dynamics modeling used. If contingency
testing indicates a problem, pre-addition testing will be needed to establish a baseline
of performance from which the direct impact of the proposed modification can be
demonstrated.

3.5.1.3 Contingency Selection

The applicant should develop a specific list of contingencies that comply with each
section of the Reliability Standards which applies, including extreme contingencies.
Additional contingency tests, consistent with those standards may be requested by
the ISO. To assist in understanding the selection of contingencies, the applicant
should provide a general description of the relay systems at 115 kV stations and
above in the vicinity of the proposed change.

3.5.1.4 Tests With A Line Out Of Service

Applications for major changes in transmission or generation facilities should
include tests of system performance with selected lines out of service assuming that
the area resources and power flows are adjusted between outages. These tests should
identify and evaluate potential constraints to future system operation.

3.5.2 Results Reporting

The applicant should provide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate system
performance under both normal and stressed conditions. This would include:


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.5.2.1 Summary of dynamic tests conducted and their results, with and without the proposed
modification, showing at a minimum the following information:

           - Load level, generation dispatch and major interface loadings;

          - Contingencies tested, with assumed sequence of events and associated times;

           - Interactions with existing special protection systems; and

          - Observed results and related comments as appropriate.

3.5.2.2 One line diagrams showing at a minimum flows and voltages with and without the
proposed modifications for the conditions tested, including:

           - Normal generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service;

           - Stressed generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service; and

             - Conditions tested with lines out of service.

3.5.2.3 Plots demonstrating that stability is maintained in the area of the modification, in
other areas of New England and in neighboring systems. Enough information must
be provided to demonstrate no other dynamics problems are encountered, such as
unacceptable voltage or frequency excursions, undamped oscillations, control
system problems, etc.

3.5.2.4 Clear, concise narrative interpreting the above results and leading to the conclusion
that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have no significant adverse effect on
the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.
Also, any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with the
proposed facility should be fully documented and explained.

3.5.3 Stability Evaluations

Evaluations of stability analyses submitted in support of Proposed Plan Applications will
be based on the considerations and expectations described in Section 3.2. Additionally,
the two aspects noted below will be of primary concern to the Reliability Committee and
the ISO during their review.

3.5.3.1 Was analysis conducted according to generally accepted practice?

          - Were assumptions and test conditions as outlined in Section 3.5.1?

          - Were tools and procedures applied properly and were they sufficient to provide a
complete analysis?

3.5.3.2 Do results of analysis support conclusion that the change(s) will: 1) result in no
significant adverse effect on the reliability of the bulk power system; and 2) meet the
NPIRs? If the analyses indicated any problem areas, how were they resolved?

The ISO will review each analysis, and consult with Affected Entities, as necessary, to ensure
that all of the applicable conditions in the Reliability Standards are satisfied. The
recommendation of the ISO to the Reliability Committee will be based on the applicant having
satisfied the applicable conditions required in the Reliability Standards.

**4.0 Protection Systems and Dynamic Control Systems**

Sections 2.6 and 3.3 of PP5-1 indicate the protection system additions/changes for which Proposed
Plan Applications are required. These fall into two categories: fault clearing and special protection
systems (SPSs).

Proposed Plan Applications for additions/changes in protection systems designed for fault clearing
should include assurance that:

     - the protection system is designed in accordance with the NPCC Bulk Power System Protection
Criteria;

     - the associated fault clearing time will not degrade system reliability performance; and

     - the NPIRs will be met.

A Level III analysis, as described in Section 3.0, may be needed to demonstrate the effects of increased
fault clearing times.

Applications for SPSs require analyses similar to that of a generation or transmission application and
the guidelines of Section 3.0 apply. In addition to compliance with the Reliability Standards and
NPCC Bulk Power System Protection Criteria, the following factors will be considered in evaluating
an application for an SPS:

     - Is the SPS initiated by a normal contingency or an extreme contingency?

     - How many events trigger the SPS? Are the triggers local or remote?

     - What are the monitoring requirements?

     - How selective are the triggers (i.e., monitor system parameters vs. breaker contact)?

     - Is the response local or remote?

     - How many inputs, decisions and actions are involved?

     - What is potential for interaction with other SPSs?

     - Is the SPS required to control dynamic, voltage or thermal response?

     - What actions are taken (load rejection, generation rejection, opening of a transmission line)?

     - What is the probability that the SPS will be required to operate?

     - What are the implications of inadvertent operation or misoperation (local vs. widespread
effects)?

     - Operational considerations (operator's view of requirements and constraints).

     - Anticipated life of the SPS - is it meant to be temporary or permanent?

     - What operating options are available if planning assumptions do not materialize?

     - What are modeling requirements; when will they be provided?

     - Economic tradeoffs with other alternatives.

     - Will the NPIRs be met?

Dynamic control systems such as voltage regulator/exciter systems, power system stabilizers and
governors on generators can have a significant effect on the stability, reliability or operating
characteristics of the bulk power system. Such dynamic control systems and their attendant effects

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

are to be included in the analyses conducted in support of new generator additions. Effects of changes
in dynamic control systems should normally be determined in the course of design studies and a
Proposed Plan Application should be submitted if such a change could have a significant effect on the
performance of the bulk power system. In such cases, a stability analysis may be requested as outlined
in Section 3.5.

**5.0 Definitions**

If appropriate definitions were available from the Reliability Standards they are used in this section.
The source of the definition is shown in parenthesis. Following these existing definitions, additional
comments are included to assist the reader in interpreting them.

For those cases where no formal definition exists, the one used here is based on a review of existing
ISO New England and NPCC documents.

5.1 Applicable Emergency Limit

Transmission circuit loading limits have been established for use under both normal and
emergency conditions. In general, normal ratings are used for ""All lines in"" conditions. Under
emergency conditions, long term emergency ratings (LTE) may be used for up to one daily load
cycle assuming no contingency would cause the loading to go above LTE. Short term emergency
ratings (STE) may be used following a system disturbance for up to fifteen minutes. The STE
ratings may only be used in situations where the component loading can be reduced below the
LTE ratings within fifteen minutes by operator corrective action.

In actual system operations, under emergency conditions, drastic action limits (DAL) may be used
where preplanned immediate post contingency actions can reduce loadings below LTE within five
minutes. These DAL limits are only used as a last resort during actual system operations. They
should not be used in testing the system adequacy in the Proposed Plan Application studies.

Emergency voltage limits have also been established for system operation under emergency
conditions. These limits recognize that voltages should not drop below those voltages required
for acceptable system stability performance, acceptable operation of generating auxiliaries,
acceptable operation of other electrical equipment, operation well above the knee of the voltage
curve, and for meeting the NPIRs. Also, the voltage should not rise above the maximum rating of
electrical equipment.

5.2 Reasonably Stressed Conditions

Reasonably stressed conditions are those severe load and generation system conditions which have
a reasonable probability of actually occurring. Generally both import and export conditions should
be addressed. The purpose of testing these conditions is to identify potential weaknesses in the
system and not to test the worst imaginable extreme.

5.3 Operating Characteristics


-----

ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating
Proposed Plan Application Analyses
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

The actual operation of the interconnected system requires that each component of the system
must be capable of operating in such a manner as not to adversely affect the system operation.
Any additions to the system must be able to operate in such a manner so as not to degrade the
present operating flexibility of the system. Operating Characteristics include, but are not limited
to: dispatchability, including constraints on economic dispatch, voltage control, flicker,
harmonics, black start capability, environmental limitations, maintenance scheduling, TV and
radio interference, audible noise, and under frequency load shedding.

5.4 Significant Adverse Effect (Section I.3.9 of the Tariff)

The existing system is designed and operated to meet specific criteria as contained in the various
documents referenced through this guideline. After the addition it must be demonstrated that there
has been no significant degradation in the level of system performance.

5.5 Normal Dispatch Conditions

Normal Dispatch Conditions refers to the economic dispatch of all New England Control Area
generation with appropriate allowance for scheduled maintenance and forced outages. Applicable
firm contractual transfers, both purchases and sales, should be included.

5.6 Remedial Action Schemes

See PP5-5 Requirements and Guidelines for Application of Remedial Action Schemes and
Automatic Control Schemes.

**Determination between Level II and Level III Analysis**

- A PPA with Level II analysis may be sufficient if:
`o` New contingencies that are created or existing contingencies that are modified in the post project system results in:

     - No more elements taken out of service when compared to the pre project system contingencies and

     - The fault clearing times for the new or modified contingencies are the same or faster than equivalent contingencies in the pre project system,

`o` The system modification is restricted to static devices (no changes to the transient stability models), and

`o` The system modification is not in the vicinity of a known stability constraint (for example, a line that is a part of an existing/planned stability limited
interface)

- All other PPAs will require Level III analysis

13 [As defined in PRC-012-2 Attachment 1, a functional modification to a RAS consists of any of the following:](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/PRC-012-2.pdf)

     - Changes to the system conditions or contingencies monitored by the RAS

     - Changes to the actions the RAS is designed to initiate

     - Changes to RAS hardware beyond in-kind replacement; i.e. match the original functionality of existing components

     - Changes to RAS logic beyond correcting existing errors

A functional modification to an ACS is defined in the same way. A change in the timing of actions taken by an ACS is not considered a functional
modification, unless the actions are taken in order to maintain transient stability, including voltage stability.

Transmission Upgrades in Circumstances of Multiple Needs

## Planning Procedure No. 4-1

 Implementation of Cost Responsibility Determination for Schedule 11
 Category C Project Transmission Upgrades in Circumstances of
 Multiple Needs[1]

**1.** **Introduction**

This Planning Procedure (PP4-1) describes the implementation of the cost allocation
provisions of Schedule 11 (Generator Interconnection Upgrade Costs) of Section II of the
Tariff,[2] by ISO New England (ISO) for Category C Projects’ interconnection-related
upgrades when there are multiple needs for a Transmission Upgrade. A Category C Project
refers to a Generating Facility classified as Category C pursuant to Schedule 11 of the
OATT, as well as an Elective Transmission Upgrade.

Pursuant to Section II.46 of the OATT, an addition or modification to the New England
Transmission System may be required to accommodate the interconnection of a new or
modification to a Generating Facility or an Elective Transmission Upgrade pursuant to
Schedules 22, 23, and 25 of the OATT. The additions or modifications necessary to
accommodate a Generating Facility are collectively defined as Generator Interconnection
Related Upgrades. The additions or modifications necessary to accommodate an Elective
Transmission Upgrade are referred to as Elective Transmission Upgrade related upgrades.
A Reliability Transmission Upgrade (Reliability Upgrade), Market Efficiency
Transmission Upgrade (Economic Upgrade), or Public Policy Transmission Upgrade
(Public Policy Upgrade) may be required or proposed pursuant to the Regional System
Plan (RSP) in Attachment K of the OATT. The cost allocation treatment of these upgrades,
modification or additions to the transmission system in New England is governed by
Schedules 11 and 12 of the OATT.

Capitalized terms used in this Procedure are intended to have the same meaning given to such terms in Sections I.2.2
of the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (the Tariff).

PP 4-1 – Implementation of Cost Responsibility Determination for Schedule 11 Category C Project
Transmission Upgrades in Circumstances of Multiple Needs

For a Category C Project under Schedule 11 of the OATT, if a Generator Interconnection
Related Upgrade is required in order to satisfy the Capacity Capability Interconnection
Standard or the Network Capability Interconnection Standard (or its predecessor standard)
the Generator Owner shall be obligated to pay all of the cost of such upgrade, including all
Direct Interconnection Transmission Costs and any applicable tax gross-up amounts, to the
extent such costs would not have been incurred “but for” the interconnection; provided
that, if ISO determines that a particular Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade
provides benefits to the system as a whole as well as to particular parties, then the cost of
such Upgrade shall be allocated in the same way as Reliability Transmission Upgrades.[3]

Based on Schedule 11 of the OATT, interconnection costs assigned to Generator Owners,
as well as Elective Transmission Owner Interconnection Customer (ETU IC), for Category
C Projects may be affected by whether an upgrade needed for the interconnection of the
Generating Facility or the Elective Transmission Upgrade has already been included in the
RSP or RSP Project List for reasons other than the Generating Facility or Elective
Transmission Upgrade interconnection. For example, if an upgrade identified as required
to accommodate the Generating Facility or Elective Transmission Upgrade interconnection
is already in the RSP Project List as a Reliability Upgrade or Economic Upgrade, as
described more fully below, its costs (depending on the project status level of the upgrade
listed in RSP or RSP Project List) potentially may not be assigned to the Generator Owner
or ETU IC even if the same upgrades would be required for the Generating Facility or ETU
interconnection.

**2.** **Cost Responsibility for Category C Project’s Interconnection-Related Upgrades**

If the upgrade needed for the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard or the Network
Capability Interconnection Standard (or its predecessor standard) in connection with a
Category C Project is the same, or is similar to and provides a similar system benefit (a

“Similar Upgrade”), in whole or part, as a Transmission Upgrade included in the RSP or
RSP Project List for Reliability, Economic or Public Policy reasons with a “Planned” or
“Proposed”[4] status before the Interconnection Agreement is finalized, the cost (or the
applicable portion of the cost) of the Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade or
Elective Transmission Upgrade related upgrade will be paid for under Schedule 12 (see
Planning Procedure 4[5] for further information) of the OATT.

An upgrade does not qualify as a Similar Upgrade if it involves situations such as:
(1) re-conductoring rather than changing reactive compensation equipment;
(2) building a new substation rather than a new transmission circuit;
(3) installing a new transformer rather than re-conductoring; or
(4) any changes, including cancellation, of projects in the RSP or the RSP Project List

resulting from a Generating Facility or Elective Transmission Upgrade’s
interconnection (that are not Similar Upgrades as described above).

## INTERCONNECTION PROCEDURE FOR
 GENERATION AND ELECTIVE TRANSMISSION UPGRADES 

**1.0** **Introduction**

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the scope of Interconnection Studies conducted pursuant to
Schedule 22 (“Large Generator Interconnection Procedures” or “LGIP”), Schedule 23 (“Small Generator
Interconnection Procedures” or “SGIP”) and Schedule 25 (“Elective Transmission Upgrade
Interconnection Procedures” or “ETU IP”) of Section II of the ISO New England Transmission, Markets
and Services Tariff (the “Tariff”). One objective of this document is to provide guidance which ensures
that the Network Capability Interconnection Standard (“NCIS”) is consistently applied in defining the
scope and study assumptions for generator and ETU Interconnection Studies. While not all ETUs are
eligible for Network Import Interconnection Service (“NIIS”), all are interconnected in a manner that, at
a minimum, meets the requirements of the NCIS. A second objective of this document is also to provide
guidance which ensures that the scope and study assumptions for preliminary nonbinding analyses for
generators and certain External ETUs that are eligible to request interconnection under the Capacity
Capability Interconnection Standard (“CCIS”) are consistently applied.

Studies conducted in accordance with this procedure are also used to support applications made
pursuant to Section I.3.9 (“Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans”) of the Tariff, [1] including
studies of proposed distributed energy resources that are processed under state interconnection
procedures. [2]

This document (and the relevant documents referenced herein) describes the interconnection
requirements and procedures for coordinated studies of new or materially modified existing Generating
Facility and ETU interconnections and their impacts on affected system(s) as required by NERC FAC-001,
Facility Interconnection Requirements. Those responsible for the reliability of affected system(s) of new
or materially modified existing interconnections are notified in accordance with the “coordination with
affected systems” provisions of the interconnection procedures.

The studies conducted in accordance with this procedure also serve to meet the requirements of NERC
FAC-002, “Facility Interconnection Studies”, to demonstrate that the proposed Generating Facility or
ETU has been comprehensively studied to identify any reliability impact of the new interconnection, or
materially modified existing interconnection, on affected system(s). As described in this document,
studies shall include steady-state, short-circuit, dynamics and other studies, as necessary, to evaluate
system performance under both normal and contingency conditions and to ensure that the proposed
implementation will not cause non-compliance with the applicable NERC Standards including TPL-001,
“Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements”.

Studies that follow the guidance provided by this document will typically be sufficient to comply with
Tariff requirements; however, that does not preclude the possibility that some situations may require
additional analyses.

1 Additional information on the relevant planning procedures is found in Planning Procedures PP5-1 and PP5-3.
2 Studies of proposed distributed energy resources (DER) are sometimes referred to as “affected system operator”
studies.


-----

**1.1** **Interconnection Standards**

NCIS describes the minimum requirements to interconnect a proposed new Generating Facility in the
New England Control Area, to interconnect an Eligible External ETU, [3] to materially change an existing
Generating Facility, to materially change an Eligible External ETU, or to increase the capability of an
existing Generating Facility or Eligible External ETU.

The NCIS is defined in the LGIP, the SGIP and the ETU IP of the Tariff.

The basic principle underlying the study approach to making the determination of no significant adverse
impact is that the energy, incrementally injected by Generating Facilities or injected by virtue of the
requested objective associated with an ETU, is allowed to be dispatched in an economic, securityconstrained manner provided that there is no significant adverse impact on the reliability of the system,
and that the ability to reliably and practicably operate the system is not compromised. Thus, when the
new Generating Facility or ETU is added to the system models used in the study, energy injections from
other Generating Facilities, external transactions, other interface transfers or ETUs generally may be
reduced by an amount not more than the net energy injection associated with the new Generating
Facility or ETU, adjusted for changes in system losses caused by the redispatch.

CCIS is defined in the LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP of the Tariff. [4]

**1.2** **Interconnection Studies**

An Interconnection Study is an Interconnection Feasibility Study, an Interconnection System Impact
Study, an Optional Interconnection Study or a re-study thereof. The scopes of these studies are
described in the LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP of the Tariff. An Interconnection System Impact Study, or a restudy thereof, shall meet all of the requirements of this procedure. When the alternative
Interconnection Feasibility study scope is elected, the analysis may consist of a limited subset of the
analyses in this procedure, focusing on the issues that are expected to be most significant for the
proposed Generating Facility or ETU.

**1.3** **Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Requests**

The approach used in the study of an Interconnection Request for an ETU will differ depending on the
type of ETU.

When addition of a specific technology is identified in an ETU Interconnection Request, the study will
take into account the type of the facility and the project’s performance objective.

When a performance objective associated with a specific Generating Facility(s) is identified in an ETU
Interconnection Request, the study will take into account both the generation and the objectives.

3 External ETUs eligible for NIIS are controllable Merchant Transmission (MTF) or Other Transmission Facility (OTF).
In this Planning Procedure, these External ETUs are referred to as “Eligible External ETUs.”
4 The details regarding the conduct of the CCIS test are contained in Planning Procedure PP-10


-----

When a performance objective of increasing transfer capability between points is identified in an ETU
Interconnection Request, the study, while meeting the requirements of Section 7 of this procedure, will
address what is specified for:

    - Transfer points (from/to)

    - Transfer capability increase and direction(s) of flow

**2.0** **Requirements for Interconnection Studies**

**2.1** **General Requirements**

The Interconnection Studies of all Interconnection Requests for Generating Facilities and ETUs, conducted
in accordance with Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 of this procedure, shall identify the minimum required upgrades
to meet all of the following requirements:

    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must satisfy the requirements of ISO New England
Planning Procedure 3: “Reliability Standards for the New England Area Pool Transmission
Facilities” (the “Reliability Standards”) and NPCC Directory 1, “Design and Operation of the
Bulk Power System” on a regional (i.e., New England Control Area) and sub-regional basis,
subject to the conditions analyzed; and shall not compromise the ability of the system to
meet NERC TPL-001: “Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements”.

    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must not diminish system transfer capability,
whether limited by an individual constrained element or a relevant interface, below the
level of achievable transfers during reasonably stressed conditions[5] and does not diminish
the reliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk power supply
system and its component systems.

    - For a proposed new Generating Facility in an exporting area, or ETU with a terminal in an
exporting area, an increase in the transfer capability out of the exporting area is not
required to meet this interconnection standard unless the transfer capability needs to be
increased to allow the proposed new Generating Facility or ETU to operate at the requested
maximum output even after the allowed redispatch described in this procedure.

    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must not diminish system transfer capability,
whether limited by an individual constrained element or a relevant interface, below the
level of possible imports into an importing area during reasonably stressed conditions and
does not diminish the reliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk
power supply system and its component systems.

    - The addition of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU does not create a significant
adverse effect on the ISO’s or local Transmission Owner’s ability to reliably operate and
maintain the system. Creation of new constraints, particularly due to stability or dynamic
voltage performance, may likely be deemed to be unacceptable, as this compromises the
ability to operate the system, especially where the number of existing interfaces cannot be

5 Reasonably stressed conditions are defined in PP5-3 as “those severe load and generation system conditions
which have a reasonable probability of actually occurring.” Reference PP5-3 for additional information


-----

increased due to operating complexity. Creation of operating limitations, particularly those
caused by short circuit contribution or equipment with limited voltage ratings are also likely
be deemed unacceptable.

**2.2** **System Configuration**

Analyses shall be performed with the existing system facilities and topology, with the addition of all
Planned transmission projects (those with approved Proposed Plan Applications under Section I.3.9 of
the Tariff) and with all relevant Generating Facilities and ETUs with active Interconnection Requests
along with their associated upgrades in the Interconnection Queue ahead of the Generating Facility or
ETU under study. [6]

In situations where some of the above projects have later in-service dates than the Generating Facility
or ETU under study, the Interconnection Study may need to analyze the topology when the Generating
Facility or ETU goes into service and the topology when all of the above projects are planned to be in
service. In addition, sensitivity analysis shall be performed as appropriate for proposed transmission
facilities that are relevant to the Interconnection Study for the Generating Facility or ETU under study. [7]

**2.3** **Load Levels**

The following load levels may be utilized in Interconnection Studies:[ 8]

    - Peak load: Load shall be at 100% of the projected (“90/10 forecast”) peak New England
Control Area load for the year the Generating Facility or ETU is projected to be in service

    - Intermediate Load: 18,000 MW New England Control Area load

    - Light Load: 12,500 MW New England Control Area load

    - Nighttime Minimum Load: 8,000 MW New England Control Area load

    - Daytime Minimum Load: 12,000 MW New England Control Area load

**2.4** **Resources** **[9]**

For steady-state and stability analysis performed at summer peak load levels, the maximum output for a
Generating Facility shall be its summer Network Resource Capability (“NRC”) value, its maximum output
at fifty degrees Fahrenheit or higher. For steady-state and stability analysis performed at intermediate,
light and minimum load levels, the maximum output for a Generating Facility shall be its winter NRC
value, its maximum output at zero degrees Fahrenheit or higher. For controllable ETUs, steady-state and
stability analysis shall be done with the maximum flow (in one direction if unidirectional or in each

direction if bidirectional) described in the requested objective. Behind the meter (BTM) Distributed
Energy Resources (DER) shall be modeled in steady state and stability analysis. [10]

**2.5** **Second Contingency Testing**

Sufficient steady state and stability N-1-1 testing to assess performance relative to NERC, NPCC and ISO
New England criteria shall be performed. [11]

**2.6** **Data Provision**

The LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP specify data submittal requirements for the associated stages of each
procedure. Starting with the submission of the Interconnection Request and before the completion of
the System Impact Study, resources undergoing the Interconnection Procedures, shall submit all data
through the Interconnection Request Tracking Tool (IRTT)[12]. NERC Standard MOD-032[13] requires that
dynamic models be provided for Generating Facilities, HVDC lines, and other power electronic devices
that are a part of the Bulk Electric System. ISO Operating Procedure OP-14 Section II.A.6 also requires
dynamics models for Generating Facilities that are 5 MW or greater in size when ISO New England
determines it to be necessary for the ISO to carry out its responsibility to reliably and efficiently operate
the power system.

Appendix B describes the usability and acceptability requirements for PSS/E models for use in
Interconnection Studies and in accordance with NERC Standard MOD-026 and MOD-027.

Resources undergoing the ISO Interconnection Procedures, shall submit the as-studied data through the
Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS) and Short Circuit Data Management System[14] after the
System Impact Study results have been accepted by the Interconnection Customer at the System Impact
Study Results Meeting.

**3.0** **Steady-State Analysis**

**3.1** **Steady-State Criteria**

Steady-state analyses shall be performed to demonstrate compliance with applicable voltage and
thermal loading criteria and shall identify any system upgrades required to satisfy these criteria.

**3.2** **Steady-State Stresses**

Steady-state studies shall be performed with a dispatch of Generating Facilities, with flows on
controllable ETUs, and with imports and exports such that it stresses power flows across applicable

transmission lines or interfaces. A stressed line or interface shall, to the extent reasonable, be at or near
their ratings or transfer limits.

A reasonable condition when power flows may not be at or near their transfer limits would exist when
the maximum number of fully loaded Generating Facilities and ETUs that may reasonably be expected to
be in service does not result in stressed power flows.

**3.3** **Steady-State Redispatch**

The steady-state portion of an Interconnection Study typically includes an analysis of the transmission
system without the proposed Generating Facility or ETU (pre-project case) and an analysis of the
transmission system with the proposed Generating Facility or ETU in service (post-project case). The
change to output of Generating Facilities and external controllable ETUs from the values in a pre-project
case to the values in the post-project case is commonly referred as redispatch.

As a result of the addition of the proposed project, the maximum collective change in the output of
other generation and changes to the flows of controllable external ETUs (the maximum redispatch) to
meet the Reliability Standards must not exceed the capacity of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU,
as measured by its intended high limit.

If the request for interconnection involves multiple generating units at a Generating Facility and the
applicant for interconnection controls all the existing generating units at that Generating Facility, the
applicant for interconnection shall specify the desired maximum output for the Generating Facility in the
Interconnection Study Agreement and the design of the interconnection shall be based on this specified
maximum output.

In addition, the following restricts the pre-contingency redispatch of Generating Facilities or external
ETUs for first contingency (N-1) conditions:

    - Redispatched Generating Facilities and redispatched ETUs and the new Generating Facility
or ETU must be able to be automatically monitored and observed for purposes of system
operation and unit commitment (for example a facility monitored and controlled by the
System Operator via SCADA and security constrained economic dispatch), and,

    - Generating Facility and ETU redispatch is not acceptable for limiting system constraints that
occur on sub-transmission or lower voltage (less than 100 kV) facilities.

Second contingency (N-1-1) testing considers two initiating events that can occur close together in time.
Following the first initiating event, system adjustments can be made in preparation for the next


-----

initiating event.[ 15] In the case of pre-second contingency Generating Facility or ETU runback and/or
tripping after a first contingency to be secure for N-1-1 conditions:

    - The runback and/or tripping that can be assumed to be achievable in 30 minutes following
the first contingency shall utilize available replacement operating reserves consistent with
PP3.

    - Generating Facilities and ETUs that are assumed to be runback or tripped (which may
include the new Generating Facility or ETU) must be able to be automatically monitored and
observed for purposes of system operation and unit commitment (for example a facility
monitored and controlled by the System Operator via security constrained economic
dispatch), and, Generating Facility and ETU runback or tripping is not acceptable for limiting
system constraints that occur on sub-transmission or lower voltage (less than 100 kV)
facilities, except as follows;
`o` where the first and second contingencies are not contingencies listed in PP3 and where
the potential performance violation is for a facility that is not a Pool Transmission
Facility, runback or tripping of non-market generation and/or Settlement Only
Generators may also be assumed in the assessment. The assessment must confirm that
such redispatch is operable [16] and does not introduce any other performance violations.

**3.4** **No Increase in Conditional Dependence**

If no existing Generating Facility or ETU is required to be in service to avoid criteria violations for the
conditions studied prior to placing the new Generating Facility or ETU in service, no existing Generating
Facility or ETU can become required to operate as a condition for acceptable operation of the new
Generating Facility or ETU for that study condition. If an existing Generating Facility or ETU is required
to be in service to avoid criteria violations for the conditions studied prior to placing the new Generating
Facility or ETU in service, the existing Generating Facility or ETU may continue to be modeled as required
to avoid criteria violations, but such reliance shall not be increased. Generating Facilities and ETUs that
continue to be required to be in service to avoid criteria violations for the conditions studied shall not be
reduced, by redispatch in the study, below the level required for system reliability before the addition of
the Generating Facility or ETU. Studies must examine relevant stressed existing Generating Facility and
ETU outage conditions in addition to outages or reductions that have been considered as part of
Generating Facility and ETU redispatch.

**3.5** **Post Contingency Resource Adjustments**

No Generating Facility or ETU can be manually tripped or manually ramped down to relieve any first
contingency facility loading in excess of the more limiting of either the Short Time Emergency Ratings or
any other applicable Transmission Owner-specific emergency ratings. Manually ramping down
Generating Facilities or ETUs to relieve first contingency overloads within the more limiting of the Short
Time Emergency ratings or any other applicable Transmission Owner specific emergency ratings can only
be applied to the Generating Facility or ETU under study, provided that the Generating Facility or ETU
reduction is acceptable to the ISO. If a reduction in Generating Facility or ETU output is required in the

15 Reference Section 3.4 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information
16 For example, the constraints and generation output levels may need to be fully observable to, and controllable by,
the operator and the implementation must be scalable and manageable in the context of reliable operating practice.


-----

pre-project system in order to relieve overloads the same reduction shall be allowed in the post project
case.

**3.6** **Steady-State Load Levels**

Steady-state analysis shall be performed at the following load levels and in accordance with Table 3-1
below. Not all scenarios will be studied for every project. Scenarios will be selected as part of the project
study scoping process:

    - Analysis shall be performed at Peak Load with the Generating Facility or ETU operating at
full capability.

`o` Four scenarios may be analyzed:

           - An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, low solar, and energy
storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capability.

           - An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, no solar, and energy
storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capability[17]

           - A mid-day peak scenario, characterized by high load, high solar, and energy
storage unavailable, while wind and conventional resources are available up
to their full capability

           - A mid-day peak scenario, characterized by high load, high solar, and energy
storage available for charging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capability

    - Analysis shall be performed at Intermediate Load with the Generating Facility or ETU
operating at full capability in the cases where conditions such as the preservation of transfer
capability are a concern.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - A shoulder load scenario characterized by intermediate load, no solar, and
energy storage available for charging, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity

           - A shoulder load scenario characterized by intermediate load, no solar, and
energy storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity

    - Analysis shall be performed at Light Load as required by the ISOto identify any upgrades that
are required to allow the Generating Facility or ETU to operate at the requested output level
while no other nearby generating facilities (that would contribute to any identified
violations) are operating.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, high solar, and energy
storage available for charging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capacity

17 The evening peak with no solar scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project


-----

           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, no solar, and energy
storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capacity

    - Analysis shall be performed at Minimum Load in cases where the Generating Facility or ETU,
and its Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, add a significant amount of
charging current to the system or in areas where there are significant resources without
significant voltage control.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - A Day-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, high
solar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity

           - A Night-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, no
solar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity[18]

    - Co-Located or Hybrid facilities may be required to analyze the combination of all scenarios
listed under the different resources of which they are comprised

    - Other Load levels and resource scenarios may be added at the discretion of the ISO where
needed.

    - BTM-DERs and other non-Modeled assets will be modelled as dispatched at the resource
availability level as shown in table 3-1 below

_Table 3-1 - Steady State Scenarios[192021]_

**_Available Scenarios/For_** Solar Availability Across Batteries/Stored Wind Conventional

High Solar OFF

Peak Load 90/10 (Gross) 85% 100% 100% 100%

18 The night time minimum load scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project.
19 Availability is interpreted as projects under their respective fuel types are able to be dispatched anywhere between
a projects minimum power (PMIN) and the level listed multiplied by the projects maximum power (PMAX).
20 Intermittent resources that are dispatched at a lower level than their max availability will not be assumed to be
available for re-dispatching post N-1
21 Gross is interpreted as prior to the addition of the DER, netting down of the load. As where Net is interpreted as
the load post addition of the DER. For example, the daytime minimum load scenario lists 12000MW (Gross), if
5000MW of DER is added, the net load is then 7000MW. For the light load scenario with high solar, 12,500 (NET)
is listed, if 5000MW of DER is added, the net load would be 7,500MW, so the scalable load would need to be scaled
up commensurate to the DER added, to meet the required 12,500MW NET level. In the cases where NET=Gross is
listed, this means there is no netting of the load due to the DER because there is no DER assumed.

**4.0** **Stability Analysis**

**4.1** **Stability Criteria**

Stability analyses shall be performed to demonstrate compliance with applicable criteria and shall
identify any system upgrades required to satisfy these criteria.

**4.2** **Stresses in Stability Analysis**

For normal contingency testing, power flows across applicable transmission lines or interfaces shall be at
the most limiting of the existing stability or thermal (set using winter transmission equipment ratings,
with appropriate margin, for light load testing) transfer limits. [22]

**4.3** **Stability Analysis Scenarios**

Stability analysis shall consider reasonable combinations of all relevant Generating Facilities, ETUs and
devices that would be expected to have significant interactions.

The Generating Facility or ETU under study as well as all local and relevant Generating Facilities and
ETUs shall be modeled at full capacity. If all Generating Facilities and ETUs cannot be dispatched behind
the limiting lines or interface, a reasonable number of combinations may need to be studied.

**4.4** **Stability Load Levels**

Stability analysis shall be performed at the following load levels:

    - Analysis shall be performed at Light Load with high levels of renewable generation online.
Appropriate combinations of relevant Generating Facilities, distributed energy resources
and ETUs shall be studied to ensure that stability is maintained for all reasonable conditions.

22 Note: All units modeled as in service for a particular stability case shall be modeled at their full output, which
may result in total transfers greater than the existing thermal transfer limit. More detail on modeling is available
in PP5-3.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, high solar, and energy
storage available for charging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capacity

           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, no solar, and energy
storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capacity

    - Analysis shall be performed at Peak Load when required by the ISO. The emphasis of the
stability analyses performed at this load level is to confirm that the response has not
significantly changed with the load level. It may also be used to assess changes in damping
if the possibility of an oscillatory response is recognized in the light load analyses.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, low solar, and energy
storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are
available up to their full capability.

An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, no solar, and energy storage available for
discharging. While wind and conventional resources are available up to their full capability[23]

    - Analysis shall be performed at Minimum Load in cases where the Generating Facility or ETU,
and its Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, add a significant amount of
charging current to the system or in areas where there are significant resources without
significant voltage control.

`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:

           - A Day-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, high
solar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity

           - A Night-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, no
solar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional
resources are available up to their full capacity[24]

    - Co-Located or Hybrid facilities will be required to analyze the combination of all scenarios
listed under the different resources of which they are comprised

    - Other Load levels and resource scenarios may be added at the discretion of the ISO where
needed.

    - BTM distributed energy resources and other non-Modeled assets will be modelled as
dispatched at the resource availability level as shown in the tables above

23 The evening peak with no solar scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project
24 The night time minimum load scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project.

**5.0** **Short Circuit**

Short circuit analyses[27] shall be conducted to demonstrate that short circuit duties will not exceed
equipment capability and shall identify any system upgrades required to satisfy this criterion. The short
circuit study base case shall include all generation and transmission projects that are proposed for the
New England Transmission System and any Affected System and for which a transmission expansion
plan has been submitted and approved by the applicable authority and which, in the sole judgment of
the System Operator, may have an impact on the Interconnection Request. The base case shall include
all generating facilities and ETUs (and with respect to (iii), any identified upgrades) that, on the date the
study is commenced: (i) are directly interconnected to the New England Transmission System; (ii) are
interconnected to Affected Systems and may have an impact on the Interconnection Request; and (iii)
have a pending higher queued Interconnection Request to interconnect to the New England
Transmission System and may have an impact on the Interconnection Request. A Generating Facility that
has notified the ISO that it will retire will not be included in short circuit studies for timeframes beyond
its retirement date.

**6.0** **Other Requirements**

**6.1** **Voltage Control and Reactive Power Requirements**

Where specified in Schedule 22, 23 or 25, Generating Facilities, ETUs and their associated
Interconnection Facilities, that are capable of voltage control, are required to be capable of a composite

25 Availability is interpreted as projects under their respective fuel types are able to be dispatched anywhere between
a projects minimum power (PMIN) and the level listed multiplied by the projects maximum power (PMAX).
26 Intermittent resources that are dispatched at a lower level than their max availability will not be assumed to be
available for re-dispatching post N-1

power delivery at their maximum rated power output (maximum MW) at the Point of Interconnection
(or at the high side of the station transformer, or at the Point of Interconnection if there is no station
transformer, in the case of a non-synchronous Generating Facility) at both the power factor of 0.95
leading and 0.95 lagging. Further, all Generating Facilities equal to or greater than 5 MW will be required
to be capable of a composite power delivery at their maximum rated power output (maximum MW) at
the Point of Interconnection[28] (or at the high side of the station transformer, or at the Point of
Interconnection if there is no station transformer, in the case of a non-synchronous Generating Facility)
at both the power factor of 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging. The Interconnection Study shall verify this
capability.

System Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the voltage control capability with the
requirements of OP-14. For all generating facilities equal to or greater than 5 MW, the study will assume
that the Generating Facility’s responsiveness to voltage changes is active and in-service, unless the study
identifies that such responsiveness cannot be activated (for example because of the pre-existing voltage
control strategy for a distribution feeder).

While it shall be identified in the Interconnection Study if the voltage control strategy must be designed
with the purpose of maintaining a scheduled voltage at the Point of Interconnection (or some other
appropriate point), it shall be acceptable for the resource to dynamically control its terminal voltage
under transient conditions, unless the Interconnection Study identifies a reliability issue that requires
the resource be capable of controlling voltage at another point, such as the Point of Interconnection.

The power factor evaluation shall be conducted with the new Generating Facility or Eligible ETU
modeled at unity terminal voltage and maximum rated power output. The maximum leading and
lagging reactive power capabilities at maximum rated power output shall be taken from the associated
facility “D-Curve” or similar specification. At both the maximum leading reactive output and at the
maximum lagging reactive output, the real and reactive power losses in the step-up transformer(s) and
other interconnection facilities, station service real and reactive load, as well any additional reactive
contribution provided by project auxiliary reactive devices, shall be calculated. The resulting net real
and reactive power at the Point of Interconnection (or the high side of the station transformer in the
case of a wind generating facility) shall be required to meet the 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging dynamic
reactive power standards. Generating Facilities that operate in a combined mode (such as combined
cycle generation) shall be evaluated on an overall combined basis.

System Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the voltage ride-through capability with
the requirements of NERC PRC-024, Generator Frequency and Voltage Protective Relay Settings.

**6.2** **Governor Control/Frequency Response**

System Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the new Generating Facility frequency
response with the droop, deadband and overall response requirements of OP-14. Testing shall include
an appropriate frequency changing event such as a large loss of load or generation.

System Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the frequency ride-through capability with
the requirements of NERC PRC-024-1, Generator Frequency and Voltage Protective Relay Settings.

28 The term “point of common coupling” is more commonly used for distribution-connected resources and will serve
as the point of measurement for the purposes of this requirement for resources that are not interconnected pursuant
to Schedule 23 (Small Generator Interconnection Procedures).


-----

**6.3** **Shaft Torque (Delta P) Testing**

Where there is a likelihood of large angular difference across an open transmission line, or of a large
change in power flow when closing a transmission line, an Interconnection Study for a Generating
Facility shall include determination of the largest change in power (Delta P) that the Generating Facility,
and other Generating Facilities in proximity, could experience as the result of reclosing following an N-1
contingency. The value of Delta P shall be included in the Interconnection Study report. The Generating
Facility or ETU shall be required to mitigate any unacceptable consequence of increased Delta P which
they cause.

**6.4** **Subsynchronous Resonance and Subsynchronous Torsional Interaction Screening**

An Interconnection Study for an HVDC facility or any project that includes a series-connected capacitor
in Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades shall include screening for the potential of causing
subsynchronous stresses on nearby generation. This screening shall examine N-1, N-1-1 and other
potential contingent or operating conditions specified by the ISO. The results of this screening shall be
included in the Interconnection Study report.

**6.5** **Electromagnetic Transient Testing**

Any inverter-based Generating Facility, including DER, an ETU that includes power electronics as part of
the facility or a Generating Facility or ETU that includes power electronics as part of Interconnection
Facilities or Network Upgrades shall provide a Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) model(s) useable in
PSCAD, of that equipment. The need for a EMT model will be discussed at the Scoping Meeting for noninverter based technology.. The EMT study shall examine N-1, N-1-1 and other potential contingent or
operating conditions specified by the ISO. Guidance regarding the requirements for PSCAD model
submittals and for EMT testing is provided in Appendix C. [29]

These EMT requirements shall not apply to wind or inverter based Generating Facilities that are not
connected to the PTF and that are not subject to the requirements of Schedules 22 or 23 of the OATT,
unless ISO New England identifies that the EMT requirements are needed to be met by the Generating
Facility for reliability reasons.

**6.6** **Operating Procedure Requirements**

An Interconnection Study shall ensure that the Generating Facility or ETU satisfies the relevant
equipment design requirements in Operating Procedures OP-12, OP-14 and OP-19.

**6.7** **IEEE 2800 Requirements**

Non-synchronous resources participating in the first ISO-NE Cluster study, pursuant to FERC Order No.
2023, (and all subsequent clusters) must meet the requirements of Appendix F.

29 Only state jurisdictional projects that are part of studies that will start after the initiation of the Transition Cluster
Study pursuant to FERC Order No. 2023 will be required to meet section 6.5


-----

**7.0** **Additional Considerations for Studies of ETUs**

The appropriate study of an Interconnection Request for an ETU will differ depending on the type and
objective of the ETU.

**7.1** **Eligible External ETUs**

The scope of study of Eligible External ETUs is described in Section 2 of this procedure. The analysis of
ETUs that have one or more terminals outside of the New England Control Area shall be coordinated
with the other Control Area(s). The analysis at the point of injection to the New England transmission
system shall be performed similar to the analysis of a Generating Facility connecting at that terminal.
The impact of loss of the ETU when it is operating at full output shall be analyzed.

The analysis of a new Eligible External ETU shall include analysis with relevant existing external
interfaces modeled with imports and exports at the maximum levels used in planning studies.

**7.2** **Internal Controllable ETUs**

A controllable ETU could be a HVDC line or an AC line with a phase-angle regulator or other control
device.

In a manner consistent with other parts of this procedure, the Interconnection Customer shall identify
the generator dispatch or dispatches that will be used to provide the energy and/or capacity transmitted
by the ETU at each terminal which is drawing power from the transmission system. The analysis shall
identify the system upgrades required to maintain the reliability of the sending area in accordance with
New England planning standards. This analysis shall be similar to the analysis that would be conducted if
a new load was added at the point of withdrawal from the New England system.

The analysis at the point of injection to the transmission system shall be performed similar to the
analysis of a Generating Facility connecting at that terminal. The analysis shall identify the system
upgrades required to maintain the reliability of the receiving area.

The impact of loss of the ETU when it is operating at full output shall be analyzed.

**7.3** **Non-controllable ETUs Involving Specified Equipment Additions without Associated**
**Specified Objectives**

The analysis of a non-controllable ETU involving specified equipment additions without specified
objectives shall be conducted consistent with the analysis of transmission additions pursuant to PP5-3.

**7.4** **ETUs Involving Specified Objectives**

An ETU Interconnection Request may not always specify the equipment that it wishes to install. For
example, a request may have the objective to increase the transfer limit across an interface by a certain
amount. When an ETU Interconnection Request specifies an objective without specifying facilities, the
study shall identify the solution necessary to satisfy the needs identified in the Interconnection Request
and shall identify the transmission upgrades required. Section 3.1 of the Elective Transmission Upgrade
Interconnection Procedures states that the ISO, at its sole discretion, determines if a proposed objective
is appropriate to propose in a single Interconnection Request.


-----

**8.0** **Preliminary Nonbinding Overlapping Impact Studies**

An Interconnection Customer with a Capacity Network Resource Interconnection Service (“CNRIS”)
Request or a Capacity Network Import Interconnection Service (“CNIIS”) Request may request that the
Feasibility Study or System Impact Study include a preliminary, non-binding, analysis to identify
potential upgrades that may be necessary for the Interconnection Customer’s Generating Facility or
External ETU to qualify for participation in a Forward Capacity Auction (“FCA”) under Section III.13 of the
Tariff, based on a limited set of assumptions to be specified by the Interconnection Customer.

The preliminary, non-binding analysis shall use the same criteria and assumptions that are prescribed in
the analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts in Planning Procedure 10: Planning Procedure to
Support the Forward Capacity Market (“PP10”). The starting point for the base case to be used in the
preliminary analysis shall be the latest developed base case that has been prepared, pursuant to PP10,
for the analysis of New Generating Capacity Resources seeking to participate in an FCA.

The set of additional assumptions that may be specified by the Interconnection Customer are limited to
additional transmission projects and/or generation projects with active Interconnection Requests under
the L/SGIP that the Interconnection Customer requests to be added to the base case.

To the extent the Interconnection Customer requests a preliminary non-binding analysis of Overlapping
Interconnection Impacts under the CCIS, a report shall contain the results of the requested preliminary
analysis, along with an identification of potential upgrades that may be necessary for the
Interconnection Customer’s Generating Facility to qualify for participation in a FCA pursuant to Section
III.13 of the Tariff.

An Interconnection Customer with an ETU Interconnection Request may specify as its performance
objective a capacity transfer capability increase. As part of the Feasibility Study or the System Impact
Study for this Interconnection Request, as requested by the Interconnection Customer; an analysis
similar to a preliminary, non-binding analysis shall be performed to verify the increase in capacity
capability. In this case, the study shall include all relevant Generating Facilities and ETUs with earlier
queue positions and all Planned transmission projects.

**9.0** **Operational Considerations**

As appropriate, the analysis shall include an assessment of the operating constraints of the proposed
transmission and generation system without identifying the additional upgrades (beyond those
identified pursuant to Section 2 of this procedure) necessary to reduce the operating constraints. The
analysis shall determine the estimated magnitude of required redispatch of generation under typical
and reasonably stressed conditions. If requested by the ISO, limited operating studies may be required
to demonstrate viable operability of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU and provide some
indication of the system conditions for which the Generating Facilities or ETU’s operation may be
restricted. The conditions to be considered in these studies shall be coordinated through the ISO.
Examples of studies that may be expected include, but are not limited to:

   - Examination of the operation of the proposed transmission or generating facilities over
expected or suspected constrained conditions with examination of the limiting performance
concern (for example thermal, voltage or stability issues). Hour-to-hour operability or
performance over longer periods may be considered. Light, intermediate or peak load levels
may be considered. Any increased need for operational oversight of the system, such as


-----

resource operating restrictions, atypical switching or the creation of additional procedures
under outage conditions shall be noted.

   - Determination if the system adjustments required to reliably serve the area of interest within
30 minutes following the first contingency change significantly, or are no longer effective,
given the proposed change.

(Note: Extensive operating studies, separate from the Interconnection Studies, may be necessary prior
to actual operation.)

**10.0** **Additional Considerations for Generating Facilities that include Storage**

The study of the discharging (i.e. generating) operating condition of a proposed electrical storage facility
shall use the study approaches described in this procedure. The study of the charging (i.e. absorbing)
operating condition of a proposed electrical storage project shall use the study approaches described in
this procedure except that it will not be studied under any of the Peak Load scenarios listed in section
3.6.

**Appendix A – General Transmission System Design Requirements for the Interconnection of New**
**Generating Facilities and ETUs to the Administered Transmission System**

All electrical facilities must be designed, built and operated in accordance with applicable NERC, NPCC,
ISO New England (including Planning Procedure 9) and the Interconnecting Transmission Owners’
standards, guidelines, criteria, or the equivalent. This document describes only the general transmission
system design requirements for new Generating Facilities and ETUs to interconnect to the Pool
Transmission Facilities (PTF). Additional technical and design requirements related to resource
interconnection and operation may also apply.

**Point of Interconnection**
The following shall be applied to the design of a new Generating Facility (resource) or ETU
interconnection:

1. All new Generating Facilities or ETUs shall be connected to the system at a new or existing
station on the existing Administered Transmission System.

2. The station shall be designed to provide independent switching of each Generating Facility or
ETU interconnection to the system and each transmission line terminating in the station. The
intent is to design the interconnection in a manner that does not adversely affect the ability to
maintain major components of the transmission system.

3. A ring bus or breaker-and-a-half connection shall be used at the point of Generating Facility or
ETU interconnection with the transmission system. Transmission system needs and use may
require a breaker-and-a-half arrangement. Alternative interconnection designs to Non-PTF
facilities shall be considered where appropriate. Additionally, two circuit breakers placed in
series may be required to mitigate the consequences of a stuck breaker that would otherwise
result in an unacceptable system performance.

4. Transmission system circuit breakers shall not be used for synchronization of new Generating
Facilities.

**Interconnection Design – Loss-of-Source**
The interconnection shall be designed such that, with all lines initially in service, there is no normal
design contingency or common mode transmission system, station, or internal plant failure which could
result in a net loss of more than 1,200 MW of resources, except in the case of an increase of no more
than 2% above the maximum capability, in place at the time of the original incorporation of this
provision into PP5-6 in June 2016, of an existing facility that already corresponded to a loss of more than
1,200 MW of resource for a normal design contingency.

**Out of Step Protection**
Each PTF connected synchronous generating resource shall be required to have out-of-step protection
installed. This protection shall detect an out-of-step condition and trip the Generating Facility to protect
the transmission system against adverse impact associated with the Generating Facility losing
synchronism with the system. Additionally, the Transmission Owner and/or the ISO may require that
supplementary supervisory detection be used in conjunction with the out-of-step protection when
necessary to prevent unnecessary and undesirable out-of-step protection operation.


-----

**Transmission Circuit Breakers**
All new 345 kV and, where identified as necessary, 230 kV and 115 kV, circuit breakers must meet the
requirements of Planning Procedure 9.


-----

**Appendix B – Requirements of PSS/E Models**

All power flow and dynamic models must be made available for use in the version of PSS/E that is in use
by ISO New England and must accurately model all of the relevant control modes and characteristics of
the equipment, such as:

  - All available voltage/reactive power control modes

  - Frequency/governor response control modes (which may be provided by a park controller)

  - Low voltage ride through characteristics, if applicable

  - Low frequency ride-through characteristics, if applicable

  - Park controller or group supervisory functionality (e.g. for a wind farm)

  - Appropriate aggregate modeling capability (e.g. for a wind farm)

  - Charging or pumping mode, if applicable (e.g., for a battery energy storage device or pumped
storage hydro Generating Facility)

**Standard Dynamics Models**
For all Interconnection Studies all models must be standard library models in PSS/E or applicable
applications. Where applicable, the most up-to-date revision of the models must be used. User-written
models will not be accepted.

**User-Written Dynamics Models**
A user written model is any model that is not a standard Siemens PSS/E library model. For all
Interconnection Studies commencing before January 1, 2017, when no compatible PSS/E standard
dynamics model(s) can be used to represent the dynamics of a device, accurate and appropriate user
written models can be used, if accepted by ISO New England after testing.

User-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data can be in either dynamic model
source code (.lib) or dynamic model object code (.obj) or dynamic linked library (dll):

  - User-written source code, object code, and parameters shall be updated for the latest PSS/E
version in use and specified by ISO New England:

a. Dynamics models related to individual units shall be editable in the PSS/E graphic user
interface. All model parameters (CONS, ICONS, and VARS) shall be accessible and shall
match the description in the model’s accompanying documentation. Certain CONEC or
CONET models may be acceptable.

b. Dynamics models shall have all their data reportable in the “DOCU” listing of dynamics
model data, including the range of CONS, ICONS, and VARS numbers. Models that apply
to multiple elements (e.g., park controllers) shall also be fully formatted and reportable
in DOCU.

c. Dynamics models shall be capable of correctly initializing and run through the simulation
throughout the range of expected steady state starting conditions without additional
manual adjustments.

d. Dynamics models shall be capable of allowing its accompanying element or elements to
be switched out-of-service (including when the bus is disconnected) in the steady-state
network without additional steps and without errors. Documentation of any special
requirements for this condition shall be clearly defined in the model documentation.

e. Dynamics models shall be capable of allowing all documented (in the model
documentation) modes of operation without error.


-----

f. A park controller model to control more than one generator (e.g., in a wind farm or
photovoltaic park) shall be able to accurately control multiple equivalent generators.
The relative reactive output of each generator shall be correctly representative of its
representation of number of units and impedance data. The park controller shall be
able to regulate a minimum of eight equivalent generator units.

g. Dynamic models shall be coded in such way that any internal changes of model variables
or parameters incurred in one simulation run shall not be automatically passed on to
the same models in subsequent simulation runs given both load-flow file and snapshot
file are restored in the same PSS/E application.

  - Models requiring allocation of bus numbers shall be compatible with the New England bus
numbering system, and shall allow the user to determine the allocation of the bus numbers.

  - Models shall initialize correctly and be capable of successful “flat start” and “ring down” testing
using the following guideline (models shall be capable of meeting these requirements when
operating at full rated (nameplate) power, and also at partial power within the physical
operating range of the equipment, across a range of feasible reactive power output conditions
and terminal voltages):

a. 20 Second No-Fault Simulation (a/k/a “flat start”): This test consists of a 20 second
simulation with no disturbance applied. The test will be considered to be passed if the
following criteria are met:

i. No generator MW change of 0.1 MW or more

ii. No generation MVAR change of 0.1 MVAR or more

iii. No line flow changes of 0.3 MW or more

iv. No line flow changes of 0.3 MVAR or more

v. No voltage change of 0.0001 p.u. or more

b. 60 Second Disturbance Simulation (a/k/a “ring down”): This test consists of the
application of a 3-phase fault for a few cycles at a key transmission bus, followed by
removal of the fault without any lines being tripped. The simulation is run for 60
seconds to allow the dynamics to settle and will be considered to be passed if the
following criteria are met:

i. No generator MW change of 1 MW or more from pre-fault to steady-state postfault conditions

ii. No generator MVAR change of 1 MVAR or more, except for exciters with dead
band control (typically IEEE Type 4) from pre-fault to steady-state post-fault
conditions

iii. No voltage change of 0.0001 p.u. or more, except in vicinity of exciters with
dead band control from pre-fault to steady-state post-fault conditions

iv. No undamped oscillations related to the addition of the new user-written model

User-written model(s) shall be accompanied by the following documentation:

  - A user’s guide for each model

  - Appropriate procedures and considerations for using the model in dynamic simulations

  - Technical description of characteristics of the model

  - Block diagram for the model, including overall modular structure and block diagrams of any submodules

  - Values, names and detailed explanation for all model parameters

  - Text form of the model parameter values (PSSE dyr file format)

  - List of all state variables, including expected ranges of values for each variable


-----

**Appendix C – Requirements of PSCAD Models**

**1.0** **EMT model requirement**

As the penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) and distributed energy resources (DER) continues
to grow, EMT models are required to support current and future study efforts which are required to
maintain a reliable power system. Models are required for one or more of the following reasons. Other
specialty studies may also be performed from time to time.

   - Integration of IBR into low system strength networks

   - Sub-synchronous control interactions (plant-to-grid)

   - IBR controls interactions (plant-to-plant and within the plant)

   - IBR controls stability (large and small disturbance)

   - IBR frequency and voltage ride-through capability and performance

   - IBR short-circuit current analysis

   - Power quality studies (e.g., harmonics, rapid voltage change)

   - Black start and system restoration studies

   - Benchmarking and verifying RMS positive sequence dynamic models

**2.0** **EMT Model Requirements**

As mentioned above, specific model requirements for a EMT study depend on the type of study being
done. A study with a scope covering weak system interconnection, ride-through, voltage control and
event response, and islanding performance (for example) would require a model which must meet the
requirements stated in Appendix C-1, and unless specified otherwise, this type of model is what is
required.

**3.0** **Model Submission Report Requirements**

Studies utilizing electromagnetic transient tools such as PSCAD rely heavily on model accuracy and
quality to be conducted in a timely manner. Failures in model quality control or insufficient care in
preparing site specific models can (and often does) result in long study delays. In order to allow ISO
New England planning studies which may involve electromagnetic transient analysis to be conducted


-----

efficiently and accurately, PSCAD model submissions are required to be delivered along with a basic
model submission report, outlined as follows:

**3.1** **Section 1: Statement of model compliance**

In this section, a statement of model compliance is required which affirms conformance with the model
requirements in Appendix C-1.

**3.2** **Section 2: Plant and Model Overview**

In this section, details of what the plant consists of and how it connects to the ISO-NE system must be
provided. This includes:

    - A single-line diagram of the plant up to the POI

    - Details of the POI (e.g. existing or new substation, voltage level, distance from the closest
existing terminal stations on either side) including any other relevant configuration
information

    - In tabular format, details of the planned (or installed) inverter capability, generator step-up
transformer (GSU), collector network, main power transformer (MPT), [31] gen-tie line, static
and dynamic reactive devices (if any)

**3.3** **Section 3: Instructions for model use**

In this section, a list of instructions for model use shall be included. This list shall include (at least):

    - Directions for compiling and running the model

    - Any special requirements for the model (e.g. simulation time-step, run-time settings, etc)

    - Instructions on directory path settings if applicable, including a list of libraries, object files,
or other files which may be required to run the model.

**3.4** **Section 4: List of plant-specific settings and description of control scheme**

In this section, any control parameters which are specific to an individual plant must be stated. These
parameters may include (among others):

    - Ride-through thresholds and parameters

    - Active power ramp rates following faults

    - Plant-level voltage controller gains and time constants

    - Interface parameters with non-turbine plant devices such as STATCOMs, if applicable

    - Description of the planned (or installed) control schemes (such voltage, frequency, reactive
power and/or power factor, runback etc.). The description should include:
`o` The target of the control scheme
`o` Overview of how it achieves its intended result
`o` Parameters which directly impacts the performance, trigger levels, deadband etc.
`o` Limitations of the control scheme

Where applicable, these parameters shall be matching with PSSE model settings, which studies are
usually performed ahead of or in parallel to PSCAD studies.

**3.5** **Section 5: Basic performance testing at approximate connection location**

In this section, a brief demonstration of model performance is required based on the location in the
ISONE network where the plant will be connecting (POI).

**Create Network Model**


-----

Using a provided PSSE network as a reference, [32] a small passive PSCAD model shall be built surrounding
the POI which represents the correct short circuit MVA under system intact, fault, and under line outage
conditions. As noted above, the presence of nearby devices can degrade performance, and this shall be
born in mind, although detailed studies will follow (in other words, performance in simplified models
may be better than performance when nearby devices are included, and design margin may be
desirable). A short description of the SCMVA values resulting from the fault conditions considered shall
be provided.

**Apply Faults**
Basic fault and contingency performance shall be tested to show plant recovery and stability under
these approximated network conditions. Plant shall be capable of riding through faults with acceptable
oscillations, and maintaining stable and accurate terminal voltage control. A set of representative plots
shall be provided to demonstrate performance [33].

**Important Note**
These basic tests are requested to provide basic quality control and site-specific testing of the plant
model. More detailed studies are required to analyze the phenomena described above, and the results
of these studies may indicate problems which are not evident in these basic tests. For example,
interactions with nearby devices will be impossible to test in a simple model without detailed models of
the nearby devices available. Other issues may be found as more detailed system models and network
conditions are tested.

**3.5.1** **Detailed Instructions for the conduct of benchmarking analysis to confirm acceptable**
**performance of the PSS/E model in comparison to the PSCAD model**

**PSS/E Simulation**

1. The project shall be modeled at full output per the project’s Interconnection Request.
2. Sufficient data channels shall be included in the snapshot file for reporting purposes. Example
channel data would include bus voltages within the project and around the project’s POI, line
and transformer flows (both real and reactive), and LVRT status signal. Channel selection shall
enable PSCAD modeling results to be directly compared against the PSS/E results.

3. Two fault simulations, each using a 6 cycle clearing time, at a bus close to the point of
interconnection, for both pre-project (without the project modeled in-service) and post-project
(with the project modeled in-service) :

a. With all lines in service
b. With one line close to the point of interconnection out of service.

31 For the purpose of this document, the MPT is the power transformer that steps up voltage from the collection
system voltage to the nominal transmission/interconnecting system voltage for dispersed power producing
resources.
32 Reference cases can be found at the following location on the ISO-NE website: http://www.iso-ne.com/systemplanning/transmission-planning/ferc-form-no-715-reports
33 Note: It will be possible for manufacturers to re-use basic model performance testing across multiple locations,
provided:

   - The site-specific model parameters are identical

   - The SCMVA levels (for N-0 and N-1 conditions) used for the testing are the same or lower than those at
the POI

   - The inverter control topology and mechanical performance is expected to be identical


-----

4. Plot scales shall be set appropriately for the reviewers to discern the entirety of the plotted
signals, without clipping. Multiple signals may be plotted together in the same plot, as long as
the signals are discernible from one another—otherwise, some of those signals should be
separated out into multiple plot diagrams.

**PSCAD Simulation**

1. PSCAD simulation shall be performed under as similar conditions as possible to the PSS/E
simulations discussed above, for the best possible comparison.

2. The Project and its associated auxiliary equipment shall be modeled with comparable
parameters between the PSS/E and PSCAD modeling, with each model’s parameters detailed in
the summary report.

3. The PSCAD transmission system case model shall be created from the PSS/E case model, with
sufficient buses included after forming the system equivalent to allow simulation of the line
outage and fault conditions modeled in the PSS/E simulations discussed above.

4. Steady-state line outage scenarios shall be created similar to those in the PSS/E simulation. For
each scenario, a short description of the SCMVA values resulting from the fault conditions
considered shall be provided.

8. Comparison plot sets modeling the same data channels from PSS/E and PSCAD shall be
developed.

**Evaluation of Results**

1. Comparison plots shall show similar results between PSS/E and PSCAD. If any significant
differences are shown between the traces, sufficient explanation shall be included about why
these differences should be considered acceptable.

**Report**

1. Statement of Model Compliance—a statement of model compliance is required which affirms
basic conformance with the PSCAD model requirements

2. List of Plant-Specific Settings—data shall be included for both PSCAD and PSS/E models. Any
control parameters which are specific to the plant must be stated. Where applicable, these
parameters shall be matching with PSS/E model settings. These parameters may include (among
others):

a. Ride-through thresholds and parameters (e.g., undervoltage thresholds or fault-Q
contribution limits)

**Appendix D – Detailed Considerations for the Study of an Inverter Based Generating Facility**

**Typical Order of Study for an Inverter Based Generating Facility**

1. Short Circuit Ratio calculation
2. Review of PSS/E-PSCAD benchmarking
3. PSCAD analysis of performance if Short Circuit Ratio is low
4. Review of performance of PSS/E model
5. Collector system/GSU tap setting/voltage control strategy calculation
6. Steady state reactive margin analysis
7. Initial dynamic fault testing
8. Full steady state testing to meet the requirements of this Planning Procedure
9. Full dynamic testing to meet the requirements of this Planning Procedure

**Use of Aggregate Models for Collector-Based Generating Facilities**
For the steady-state portion of the System Impact Study, including the detailed collector system analysis
described below, a fully explicit model of the collector system, including all branch connections and
step-up transformers shall be used.

For the stability portion of the System Impact Study, an equivalent model shall be used for each major
feeder branch of the Generating Facility. The following figure provides a representation of the
appropriate equivalent to be used.

**Collector system/GSU tap setting/voltage control strategy calculation**
A detailed evaluation using a fully explicitly modeled collector-based Generating Facility allows for
analysis of voltage control strategies by showing the real and reactive power flow and losses across
every element of the facility. Being able to monitor the terminal voltage at each individual generating
unit makes it possible to ensure each unit remains within a reasonable voltage range to avoid tripping.
All collector branches, junctions, individual high and low voltage busses (including the GSUs and
generating units) shall be modeled using the configuration, network impedances, generating unit
reactive capabilities and facility ratings for the project.


-----

  - The following voltage regulation modes should be reviewed as appropriate:

`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a remote bus
`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a Park transformer high side bus
`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a Park transformer low side bus
`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a fixed power factor

**Step 1 – Reactive Power Capability**
This step investigates the reactive power range of the overall Generation Facility and seeks to determine
if the collector system design allows full reactive power capability. It also tries to determine what unit
and station transformer taps allow for the largest reactive power injection range of the generating units.

  - The POI may be modeled as a swing bus for this analysis. A fictitious machine may be placed at
the swing bus to consume the Project output and to allow for adjustment of transmission
system voltages.

  - Testing is performed to determine if the generating units would violate any voltage trip settings
given the full leading and lagging reactive power range of the generating units.

  - The reactive power output of the generating units is ramped to the maximum leading negative
MVAR and to the maximum lagging capability positive MVAR for various system voltages and
transformer tap settings.

  - If any bus voltage within the Project or collector system is outside of the specified range, the
generating unit reactive power output for the wind park should be recorded along with the first
bus that showed a voltage outside of the range. This information is used to determine which
transformer tap settings result in the greatest usable reactive power range of the generating
units as a way to pre-screen the testing required for Step 2.

**Step 2 – Collector System Voltage Range**
The goal of this testing is to develop a strategy to maintain sufficient margin to the generating unit trip
settings and if possible maintain a preferred Generation Facility terminal voltage range (typically 0.95 to
1.05pu) for any transmission system voltage (typically 0.9 pu to 1.1 pu).

  - Testing is performed at different plant output levels 0% to 100% output in 10% intervals with
equal loading across all individual generating units.

  - For each of the applicable control strategies described above, and optimum tap settings from
Step 1, a voltage profile is created and the minimum and maximum voltages within the facility is
recorded.

**Step 3 – VAR impact to the System and Voltage Schedule Margin**

  - The goal of this testing is to identify a strategy that will minimize the reactive power demand
from the system under normal conditions, but also provide VAR support under low voltage
conditions and consume MVAR under high voltage conditions.

  - To ensure there is proper margin with the scheduled voltage (as determined by ISO during the
study), +/-2% from scheduled voltage is evaluated.

5. Changes after the System Impact Study is completed

  - A proposed project that has a completed System Impact Study, or an existing generating facility
or ETU can request that a proposed change be evaluated to determine if the change is a
Material Modification. If this happens, the proposed change will be evaluated using technical
screening criteria. However, there may be proposed changes that have not been contemplated
and might require additional analysis beyond the normal screening criteria

  - The following will be deemed material and require a new Interconnection Request

`o` Where the change(s) would either require significant additional study of the same
Interconnection Request and could substantially change the interconnection design, or
have a material impact (i.e., an evaluation of the proposed modification cannot be
completed in less than ten (10) Business Days) on the cost or timing of any
Interconnection Studies or upgrades associated with an Interconnection Request with a
later queue priority date

5 (a). Screening Criteria for Changes in Dynamic Models or Voltage Control Schemes

  - The following will not be deemed material and require a new Interconnection Request

`o` There is no voltage or dynamic stability problem that may be adversely affected by the
change to the project that is found in any base cases for the most severe N-1 and N-1-1
contingencies


-----

`o` The new models provide similar or better dynamic voltage and stability performance
based on dynamic simulation of a few severe faults

5 (b). Screening Criteria for Short Circuit Impacts of Changes in Generation or ETU or Interconnection
Facility Impedances

  - The following will not be deemed material and require a new Interconnection

`o` The total impedance is greater than that of the previously submitted unit(s) and X/R
ratio is less than or equal to that of the previously submitted unit(s)

`o` A short circuit study at only the interconnecting bus confirms that short circuit duty is
less than or equal to that of the previously submitted unit(s)

5 (c). Screening Criteria for Stability Impacts of Changes in Generation or ETU or Interconnection Facility
Impedances

  - The following will not be deemed material and require a new Interconnection

`o` The new models provide similar or better dynamic performance (better damping,
smaller angular swing) based on dynamic simulation of a few severe faults

5 (d). Screening Criteria for Voltage Impacts of Changes in Generation or ETU or Interconnection Facility
Impedances

  - The following will be deemed material and require a new Interconnection Request

`o` A change that will result in the Generating Facility or ETU not meeting the Tariff's power
factor requirement

  - The following will not be deemed material and require a new Interconnection

`o` The change of impedance is small (less than 10% of the impedance used in the SIS), the
power factor requirement is satisfied, and there is no pre-existing voltage problem

5 (e). Screening Criteria for PSCAD Changes to Generating Facilities or ETUs that Required a PSCAD
model

  - The following will not be deemed material and require a new Interconnection Request

`o` The new models provide similar or better performance for the most severe N-1 and N-11 contingencies

1 **PURPOSE**

This document provides consistent cost engineering terms and definitions and a standardized

approach to cost estimating in the region for Regional Benefit Upgrade (RBU) projects developed

through the Solutions Study process pursuant to Section 4.2 of Attachment K of the OATT, or

reconstructions/replacements of Pool Transmission Facilities.

This document also outlines the active review and reporting of cost estimates throughout the

project life cycle from the planning and design to the construction phase. The process outlined in

this document will help enable consistency in Participating Transmission Owners’ project cost

estimates, increase project costs transparency, and provide regular information about the

transmission investments made in the region and the impact to rates.

2 **TERMS AND DEFINITIONS**

2.1 Cost engineering definitions

Cost Estimate: A prediction of quantities, cost, and/or price of resources required by the scope of

an asset investment option, activity, or project. As a prediction, an estimate must address risks

and uncertainties. Estimates are used primarily as inputs for budgeting, cost or value analysis,

decision making in business, asset and project planning, or for project cost and schedule control

processes. Cost estimates are determined using experience and calculating and forecasting the

future cost of resources, methods, and management within a scheduled timeframe.

  - Base Estimate: The Base Estimate is the original estimate (without contingency) in any

estimate class (A, B, C or D). The Base Estimate will not change while the project is in the

particular estimate class and all cost adjustments will be based on this estimate. For a

Base Estimate to change the project will need to be moved to a differed Estimate Class

  - Escalation: The provision in actual or estimated costs for an increase in the cost of

equipment, material, labor, etc., over that specified in the purchase order or contract due

to continuing price level changes over time. Inflation may be a component of escalation,

but non-monetary policy influences, such as supply-and-demand, are often components.


-----

Contingency: An amount added to an estimate to allow for items, conditions, or events for

which the state, occurrence, or effect is uncertain and that experience shows will likely

result, in aggregate, in additional costs. Typically estimated using statistical analysis or

judgment based on past asset or project experience.

Project: For the purpose of this document, a Project shall mean a RBU developed though

the Solutions Study process pursuant to Section 4.2 of Attachment K of the OATT, or

reconstructions/replacements of Pool Transmission Facilities included in the Regional

System Plan and/or the ISO-NE Asset Condition List. Projects are broken down by

components in the RSP listing (Lines & Substations) but are typically permitted and

reviewed as a whole for efficiency and resource/costs savings.

- Project Scope: The sum of all that is to be or has been invested in and delivered by the

performance of an activity or project. In project planning, the scope is usually documented

(i.e., the scope document).

- Project Components: The breakdown of the Project into a subset. Examples of project

elements would be a transmission line, substation, switching station, underground

transmission line, etc. As described above, these will typically correspond to an individual

RSP Project ID number or Asset Condition List Project ID number.

- Change in Scope: A change in the defined deliverables or resources used to provide them.

- Right of way cost: All costs associated with the acquisition of new right of way including

easements, land purchases, and associated agent, surveying (relative to land acquisition)

and recording fees (as defined by FERC 350 account definition).

- Level of Project Definition: This characteristic is based upon percent complete of project

definition (roughly corresponding to percent complete of engineering). The level of project

definition defines maturity or the extent and types of input information available to the

estimating process. Such inputs include project scope definition, requirements documents,

specifications, project plans, drawings, calculations, learning’s from past projects,

reconnaissance data, and other information that must be developed to define the project.


-----

2.2 Examples of Contingency & Scope Change

The variance to the cost estimate baseline falls into the two categories defined in section 2.1,

contingency or scope changes. Contingency typically reflects the risks associated with some of

the project elements. These risks are identified, quantified and a cost is associated with these

risks. Scope changes on the other hand accounts for project costs incurred as a result of changes

to the project itself. The following list gives a few examples of each of these cost categories.

Some examples for transmission project contingency are:

      - Field condition design adjustment (e.g. field conflict)

     - Incremental change to cost estimate (e.g. unit price increase) excluding general

escalation.

     - Estimating variances (e.g. quantity, equipment)

     - Design development and changes within the original scope (e.g. pole placement

less than 50ft)

     - Market & vendor variations (e.g. price delta between vendors)

     - Reasonable environmental condition or customer request adjustments (e.g.

avoiding stream)

     - Weather impact on construction (limited to minor delays of few days or less)

     - Permitting requirements (e.g. working hour restrictions, rare plants and species

protection measures)

Contingency usually excludes:

     - Major scope changes such as changes in end product specification, capacities,

building sizes, and location of the asset or project;

      - Extraordinary events such as major strikes and natural disasters;

      - Escalation and currency effects.

Some of the items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, and/or effect is

uncertain include, but are not limited to, planning and estimating errors and omissions,

minor price fluctuations (other than general escalation), design developments and changes


-----

within the scope, and variations in market and environmental conditions. Contingency is

generally included in most estimates, and is expected to be expended.

Some examples for transmission project Scope changes are:

     - Substation site relocation

     - Design criteria change

     - Currency effects

     - Regulatory & permitting project definition changes (e.g. undergrounding

transmission or distribution lines, Army Corps of Engineer construction

requirements)

     - Project re-Routes or relocation from the original Scope

     - Changes to the project to accommodate compliance measures (Environmental,

Land impact mitigation)

     - Significant project delays (cost incurred through the escalation cost and the

carrying charges for the project, including capital interest)

     - Major schedule changes


-----

3 **COST ESTIMATING PROCESS**

3.1 Development of the cost estimate

The development of initial cost estimates takes place early in the regional planning process to

allow for alternative comparison as well as alternative cost/benefit evaluation. As the project goes

through its life cycle, different grade of estimates are developed and released. The different types

of estimates are:

    
   - Conceptual Estimate[1]

   - Planning Estimate

   - Engineering Estimate

   - Construction Estimate

The level of detail in the estimate will increase as the project develops. The level of project

definition also varies depending on the stage of the project. The following shows the expected

level of definition on various project phases and the corresponding estimate types:

Table 1: Cost Estimate types per project phase

3.1.1 Cost estimate components

Base Estimate Development

The project estimate depends on the level of project definition as well as the type of estimate being

developed. At a minimum the cost estimate should be broken down by project elements (e.g. line

segments, substations etc…). The estimate shall conform to the template as described in section

1 For Asset Condition Projects only.


-----

4 of this document. The following information and level of details should be provided at the different

project stages of the estimate development process:

  - Concept project: Cost broken down by project elements (lines, substations, etc…).

Analogous cost estimating practices may be used to developed conceptual stage estimates

(using similar past projects as a reference).[2]

  - Proposed Project: Project characteristics should be refined (e.g. line mileage, major

equipment specifications, etc…) so to achieve a project level of definition sufficient to

achieve the level of accuracy targeted. Some preliminary engineering, field recognition may

be necessary to refine project knowledge.

  - Planned Project: One line diagrams and preliminary design with proposed project location

and equipment specifications need to be developed in order to increase the level of project

definition. These requirements are already in place to enable Proposed Plan Application

(PPA) approval and for the ISO to authorize the project to proceed.

  - Transmission Cost Allocation (TCA): For TCA approval a. detailed estimate should be

developed and broken down by the following cost categories:
```
     o Material
     o Labor
     o Right of way costs
     o Engineering, Permitting (Including administrative & legal cost) and Indirects
     o Financing cost (AFUDC & Interest Costs)
     o Escalation (using Handy Whitman or similar)
     o Contingency

```
At a minimum the project scope of work shall be developed and provided with the estimate (See

reporting template for details in section 4 of this document)

Escalation

At each of these stages costs should be calculated and the estimate expressed in year-of
expenditure dollars to reflect escalation. This can be done by assigning an inflation rate per year

2 To be used for Asset Condition projects only.


-----

for the different project cost elements. The selected year-of-expenditure should reflect a realistic

scenario, taking into account project planning and permitting durations, as well as construction

timeframe. Inflation rates may be different for specific cost elements (e.g. substation vs.

transmission lines). Handy Whitman is a custom tailored index for the utility industry where

updates are released twice a year. This index follows the Uniform System of Accounts as defined

by the Electric Code of Federal Regulations (Title 18) and is used by the utility companies for tax

preparation and depreciation purposes. Despite its historical basis it does provide accurate trends

that may be used to anticipate inflation rates. Estimates should clearly specify how inflation is

considered in the estimate and clearly state that the estimate is expressed in year-of-expenditure

dollars. Multiple sources may be used for determining the inflation rate, including other nationwide

and local references.

Contingency

Reasonable contingencies should be developed and evaluated for each project cost estimate.

Contingency captures uncertainties and cost risks within an estimate. The contingency should

adhere to the definition as provided in Section 2 of this document and is dependent on the level

of project definition. Some general guidelines for contingency have been developed based on

AACE definitions by EPRI and the Department of Energy and are shown in Table 1 above.

Major and more complex projects may include higher contingency levels based on increased

project risks and challenges. Typically, as the project is refined, the contingency should reflect the

shift of contingencies into actual cost categories. Transmission Owners should manage risks and

uncertainties to reduce the contingency used. However, per the AACE definition, historically,

contingency is expected to be expended and should be included in the estimates.

3.2 Cost Estimate Accuracy & Contingency

Contingency and accuracy should not be confused. Where contingency reflects an amount added

to a project cost estimate for project unknown and risks identified, accuracy reflects the probability

that the estimate will come within a predefined parameter (e.g. 90% confidence). Accuracy is

defined by the width of the bell curve distribution of the cost estimate. Contingency is fully part of

an estimate.

4 **PROJECT COST ESTIMATES UPDATES**

4.1 Submission of Project Cost Estimate Updates.

For Projects that are a Category 4 or 5 TCA (as identified in Section 1.5, Table 1, of Planning
Procedure No. 4), a Project Cost Estimation Update must be submitted at least once a year to
the ISO and the RC. The update should correspond with the RSP Project List update and
[should be sent to TCApps@iso-ne.com.](mailto:TCApps@iso-ne.com)

4.2 Project Cost Estimate Template

The Project Cost Estimate Template will be used the first time a Project is reviewed. The Project
Cost Template will be completed one time and not changed unless the Project estimate’s class
changes. It is not necessary to submit a Project Cost Estimation Change Reporting Template
when completing this template.

4.3 Project Cost Estimate Change Reporting Template

The Project Cost Estimate Change Reporting Template will be used to update project costs and
completion percentage. This is the template that will be used once a Project Cost Estimation
Template has been completed. It is not necessary to update the Project Cost Estimation
Template when completing this Template.

Analyses"" provides guidance on what information and analysis should be available to support a
submittal. The completed applications and supporting materials describing and assessing the
impact of the proposed plans together shall constitute submittal of a Proposed Plan Application
(PPA).

Establishment and maintenance of approval of a PPA establishes the determination that
implementation of the proposed plan will not have a significant adverse effect upon the reliability
or operating characteristics of the Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s system or of the
systems of one or more other Affected Entities [1] and the Market Participant or Transmission Owner
is free to proceed with the proposed plan.

As prescribed per this document, a Market Participant or Transmission Owner will submit a PPA to
the ISO. Where a non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner is involved, the non-Market
Participant or non-Transmission Owner must meet the same requirements as for a Market
Participant or Transmission Owner, except that a Market Participant or Transmission Owner on
behalf of the non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner must submit any PPAs. Typically,
the Transmission Owner that interconnects with the non-Market Participant or non-Transmission
Owner will submit the PPA for the interconnection. If transmission facility changes are required to
interconnect non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner facilities, the Market Participant
or Transmission Owner who owns, or will own, the facilities at the Point of Interconnection with
the non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner facilities is responsible for submission of
the Transmission PPAs. Joint Applications may need to be filed if systems of others are involved.

Market Participants or Transmission Owners must follow the “PPA Submittal Procedure” contained
in Attachment 5 to this procedure for their submittal of PPAs to the ISO. This attachment details
the flow of information required under this planning procedure and Planning Procedure 5-3,
“Guidelines for Conducting and Evaluating PPA Analysis,” to promote a smooth PPA review by the
Reliability Committee and review and approval by the ISO.

**1.1** **Description of the Proposed Plan Application Process**

The ISO will coordinate the PPA process.

**1.1.1** **Initial Assessment**

The complexity of proposed changes to the system can range from minor changes to major
alterations. The intention of the Proposed Plan process is to match study effort and review effort
appropriate to the complexity of the proposed change. In PP5-3 “Guidelines for Conducting and
Evaluating Proposed Plan Application Analyses”, guidance relative to study effort is provided
through a discussion of different study levels. PP5-3 defines four levels of analysis: Level 0, Level I,
Level II, and Level III. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner must discuss proposed plans
early in the process with the ISO and, as necessary, the host Transmission Owner for guidance
regarding the appropriate level of study required or whether a PPA is needed.

The ISO will examine the proposed plans and evaluate the potential for significant adverse impact
on the stability, reliability, or operating characteristics of the interconnected system. Based on
this examination, the ISO will advise the Market Participant or Transmission Owner regarding
whether input should be solicited from other committees or any Affected Entity. Other
committees include, but are not limited to, the Principal Committees.

The ISO will engage potentially technically impacted Affected Entities during the conduct of the
studies that will be used to support a PPA.

**1.1.2** **Submittal of a Proposed Plan Application**

All required materials, as described below, shall be sent with supporting documentation to the ISO
who will collect, distribute, and provide a record of the PPA to a Reliability Committee meeting for
which action is expected. Submittals of PPAs or supporting materials that are received by the ISO
after the deadlines described below shall result in deferral of review to a following noticed
Reliability Committee meeting that satisfies the submission timing requirements of this procedure,
unless, it is decided at the discretion of the officers of the Reliability Committee, to conduct the
review at the requested meeting.

In order for the ISO to conduct its review, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner shall
provide modeling data adequately representing the planned facility to the ISO prior to the
submittal of the PPA documentation. The submission of modeling data as early as possible is
encouraged and submissions of modeling data may be made prior to the dates described in the
following sections. Model submission and approval will be required for PPA approval.[2] Figure 1
below and accompanying text illustrate and describe the timelines and requirements.

2 At the ISO’s discretion, PPA approval may be provided where the submittal requirements of this procedure were met, but
not all of the issues associated with accepting the models have been addressed, provided that the proponent is demonstrating
best-efforts to resolve the outstanding model-acceptance issues.

Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

For Proposed Plans requiring Level II and Level III analysis, the ISO shall advise and notify the
Market Participant or Transmission Owner whether one or two Reliability Committee meetings will
be recommended to complete the review. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner shall
submit models and draft study materials for review prior to the formal PPA submittal in
accordance with the applicable timeline depicted in Figure 1B or 1C, as described below. Note that
the PPA review schedule does not begin until the PPA form is submitted. [4]

**Level II or Level III Analysis – One Reliability Committee Meeting**

If the ISO advises that only one Reliability Committee meeting is recommended for the PPA under
consideration, the timeline entitled “Level II or Level III – One Meeting PPA Approval Process” in
Figure 1B shall be applicable. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner shall provide models
in accordance with Section 1.1.2.1 below and draft study materials[5] at least 30 calendar days prior
to the PPA submittal deadline for the RC meeting. Final study materials for posting to the RC must
be submitted to the ISO by emailing [ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com], along with the PPA and other
supporting materials, at least ten Business Days prior to the Reliability Committee meeting during
which action on the PPA is requested.

**Level II or Level III Analysis – Two Reliability Committee Meetings**

If the ISO recommends two RC meetings for the Level II or Level III PPA under consideration, the
timeline entitled “Level II or Level III – Two Meeting PPA Approval Process” in Figure 1C shall apply.
The Market Participant or Transmission Owner shall provide models in accordance with Section
1.1.2.1 below and draft study materials[6] at least sixty calendar days prior to the PPA submittal
deadline for the Reliability Committee meeting during which action on the PPA is requested. Final
study materials for posting to the Reliability Committee must be submitted to the ISO by emailing

  - a steady state model into the Siemens PTI Model on Demand (MOD) and auxiliary modeling
information such as, but not limited to, contingency definitions etc. in a format compatible
with the ISO Basecase Database (BCDB)

  - dynamics data into the Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS) for transmission
equipment with dynamic models and for Generating Facilities ≥ 5MW[9]

  - short-circuit data as described in OP-16, Appendix K

After the models are submitted as described in this procedure, subsequent model updates during
project construction shall be submitted in accordance with ISO Operating Procedures OP-14 and
OP-16 and/or the relevant model provisions of the ISO interconnection procedures, as applicable.

**1.1.2.2 PPA Submission Requirements**

A PPA submission shall include:

  - the application(s) with a cover letter, a one-line diagram illustrating the proposed change
relative to the existing system along with proposed equipment nomenclature, and,

`o` For Level II or Level III analysis, a report that documents the study and supports the
application

         - the report shall include appendices with steady-state, dynamics and short
circuit models used for the study

`o` a map locating the facilities should also be provided if available

For PPAs that require two Reliability Committee meetings, the Market Participant or Transmission
Owner shall submit the final PPA materials after the Reliability Committee conducts its initial
review during the first meeting, and at least ten Business Days prior to the second Reliability
Committee meeting.

Consistent with Attachment 4 of this Planning Procedure, the ISO shall post the relevant
submission materials for Reliability Committee review.

It is recommended that a PPA not be filed more than 5 years prior to the proposed in-service date.
Applications that are submitted for review more than 5 years in advance of the proposed inservice date must include an explanation of the need for this lead time and a schedule of clearly
defined milestones related to the pursuit of permitting, licensing and construction of the proposed
plan. The schedule of milestones will be used to demonstrate due diligence to the Reliability
Committee and the ISO.

**1.1.3** **Review and Consideration of a Proposed Plan Application**

The ISO will supply the Reliability Committee brief statements describing the ISO’s
recommendation on PPAs that require Level II or Level III analysis, including any opinions
expressed by Affected Entities regarding significant impacts that they believe to be insufficiently
addressed. Such recommendations are preferably provided to the Reliability Committee with the

distribution of the meeting material and agenda. If any of the recommendations are not available
at the time of the distribution of the meeting material and agenda, the recommendations should
be provided prior to the Reliability Committee acting on the PPA. If the recommendations are not
available by the time the Reliability Committee is prepared to act on the application, the
committee may elect to defer action subject to the time constraints defined in Section 1.1.2.

A draft motion describing the conditions of the approval for the PPA consistent with the Technical
Committee Bylaws will be distributed by the ISO.

If in reviewing the application and associated information, the Reliability Committee decides
additional information, review, or study is required prior to acting on the application, the
Reliability Committee may elect to defer action and solicit supplementary information, review, or
study as required. Sources for such additional information may be, but are not limited to, the
Market Participant or Transmission Owner sponsoring the application, other Market Participants
or Transmission Owners, the ISO, and other committees.

The actions the Reliability Committee may take are to defer action, recommend approval by the
ISO, or recommend disapproval by the ISO. The Reliability Committee is expected to act on all
PPAs that require Level II or Level III analysis. Applications requiring Level I analysis do not need
approval, but do need Reliability Committee concurrence that only Level I analysis is required.

Reliability Committee members will be responsible for establishing an understanding of each
application through their own knowledge, review of the documentation provided with the
application, and/or consultation with the ISO, and/or other committees.

The Secretary of the Reliability Committee will notify the Members and Alternates of the
Participants Committee and the ISO of the actions taken by the Reliability Committee. This written
notice will be delivered prior to the end of the fifth (5th) business day following a meeting of the
Reliability Committee as specified by the Technical Committee Bylaws. This notification will
constitute formal confirmation that such action was taken. The ISO will consider the
recommendations of the Reliability Committee in the process of approving/disapproving each PPA.
The ISO will transmit an official letter to the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting
the Application noting such approval or disapproval. Upon approval the Market Participant or
Transmission Owner shall be free to implement the proposed plan in accordance with the Tariff,
including compliance with any additional requirements contained therein, e.g. the requirements of
the process for the interconnection of new generating resources or modification of existing
generating resources pursuant to Schedules 22 and 23 of Part II of the Tariff, subject to the terms
of this document. If any Reliability Committee member provides a written objection to a PPA,
such objection will be conveyed to the ISO. In the event that another Market Participant or
Transmission Owner objects to the actions of the ISO, the Tariff specifies avenues for resolution of
the objection.

**1.1.4** **Withdrawal of a Proposed Plan Application**

Withdrawal of a PPA is indication that a Market Participant or Transmission Owner no longer
intends to pursue a proposed plan. Should a Market Participant or Transmission Owner wish to
withdraw its PPA, a letter to that effect should be sent to the ISO. The ISO will distribute the


-----

g g
Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

notice of withdrawal to the appropriate committees. Consideration as to which committees
should be notified will be subject to the stage of the processing of the application. PPAs associated
with projects that have withdrawn from the interconnection queue shall be considered
automatically withdrawn.

**1.1.5** **Currency of Approved Applications**

Following review and approval of the proposed plans associated with one or more PPAs,
implementation of the proposed plans must continue to be actively pursued for such applications
to remain current. Any of the following conditions may result in a determination that approval of
such applications is revoked:

a. Two years have elapsed from the proposed in-service date on the approved PPA(s) and the

Market Participant or Transmission Owner has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuit of
permitting, licensing and construction of the approved proposed plans. For proposed
plans associated with an application submitted pursuant to the Tariff (""Tariff Application""), a
valid and current Tariff Application shall constitute due diligence in pursuit of
implementation of the proposed plans.

b. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner has not sufficiently modified the proposed
plans as required to address the difference between the modeled and actual or expected
system.

c. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner has elected not to pursue completion of the
proposed plans described in the approved PPA(s).

d. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner makes a change in the scope of the proposed
plans described by the original PPA.

e. The PPAs were submitted for review and approved more than 5 years in advance of the
proposed in-service date, and the Market Participant or Transmission Owner has not
demonstrated due diligence in pursuit of permitting, licensing and construction of the
approved proposed plans through annual progress reports. For proposed plans associated
with an application submitted pursuant to the Tariff (""Tariff Application""), a valid and current
Tariff Application shall constitute due diligence in pursuit of implementation of the proposed
plans.

The ISO, in consultation with the Reliability Committee, will notify the Market Participant or
Transmission Owner where such conditions have led to the conclusion that the approval of the
associated PPAs may be revoked. However, within 90 days following notification of such action
the Market Participant or Transmission Owner may submit studies and/or information for review
and approval by the ISO that addresses the issues leading to this conclusion in order to maintain
approval of such applications. The ISO may modify the time limits identified above as appropriate.

Studies must be updated and proposed plans modified accordingly if the actual or expected
system is, as of the proposed plans’ actual in-service date, sufficiently different from what was
modeled in the analysis supporting the approved PPA(s). The updated studies will identify
whether a part of a proposed plan that is no longer being pursued, as identified per this


-----

g g
Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

Procedure, is a necessary component or condition of another proposed plan that has maintained
its currency. In this case, a Proposed Plan approval associated with the necessary component or
condition will remain current.

**1.2** **Time Limits Prescribed in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff for Review of a Proposed Plan**
**Application for a New Plan or a Revised Proposed Plan Application for a Revised Plan**

Section I.3.9 of the Tariff [10] requires each Market Participant or Transmission Owner to submit a
PPA to the ISO at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed in service date. In the case of
transmission facilities developed through the Solutions Study process or the competitive solution
process, no significant action (other than engineering reasonably necessary to support the
Solutions Study or competitive solution process) shall be taken.

Any revisions to a previously approved PPA proposed for implementation prior to the in-service
date of such previously approved Proposed Plan must be specified on a revised PPA form. The
completed PPA form for a new plan or a revised PPA for a revised plan requiring analysis must
include documentation of the analyses that have been determined to be required by the ISO, in
consultation with Affected Entities, as necessary, or the Reliability Committee. If during the PPA
review process a significant adverse impact on the New England Control Area system or any
Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s system is identified, then the PPA will be rejected.

Due to the amount of time required for the Proposed Plan process, Market Participants or
Transmission Owners are strongly recommended to supply appropriate data, with adequate lead
times for performance and completion of any anticipated analyses and its review by ISO as
described in “Level of Analysis Required” (see PP5-3, Section 3.1.2), prior to formal submittal of a
PPA to the ISO. If the appropriate data is not supplied with adequate lead times for performance
and completion of any anticipated analyses and its review by ISO, then implementation of the
proposed plans may be delayed or rejected regardless of their stage of physical completion.

**1.3** **Issues Not Covered by These Procedures**

For issues not covered by these or any other documented procedure, Market Participants or
Transmission Owners are expected to discuss pertinent issues with, and seek guidance first from
the ISO. If the issue involves a policy decision, the ISO may suggest an approach for addressing the
issue. Such approach may involve raising the issue for discussion, guidance, or decision from one
or more committees.

submitted in accordance with this Planning Procedure within 30 calendar days from the end of the
Interconnection Customer’s comment process following the completion of a System Impact Study
pursuant to Schedule 22 or Schedule 23 of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff.

11 Changes in MW or MVAR capability reflect a change in the fundamental capability of the unit or station.

12 For the purposes of this section, a station is a group of generators and associated terminal equipment (including generator
interconnections) all contained by a continuous fence and owned by a single entity.

13 Net station output is output delivered to the Point of Interconnection.

14 NERC Standard FAC-002-4, Facility Interconnection Studies, introduces a new term, Qualified Change, which is defined by
ISO-NE as an interconnection of new generation, transmission, or electricity end-user facilities or change of an existing

Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

At the same time (and for the same Reliability Committee meeting) as the submittal of the
Generation PPA, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner, if necessary, must submit a PPA
for transmission associated with the generation in accordance with Section 2.2 of this procedure.

**2.2** **Transmission Changes**

All transmission changes that change the topology or characteristics of the transmission system or
that change the thermal capability of a portion of the system by replacement of transmission
facilities except as exempted in Section 4 require a PPA (Attachment 3). Transmission Applications
must be approved by the ISO.

For all major changes to transmission facilities with design voltages at or above 69 kV, the Market
Participant or Transmission Owner will supply the results of completed studies to the ISO
sufficiently in advance of the Proposed Plan Transmission Application so that sufficient time for
review is allowed. This includes changes to generator leads and their associated equipment, such
as a GSU. [18]

PPAs associated with Elective Transmission Upgrades shall be submitted in accordance with this
Planning Procedure within 30 calendar days from the end of the Interconnection Customer’s
comment process following the completion of a System Impact Study pursuant to Schedule 25 of
the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff.

**2.3** **Demand Resource Additions and/or Incremental Updates**

Any generation additions or changes, including Distributed Generation, should follow the
generation submittal and notification requirements of this PP5-1, even if they are intended to
participate in ISO New England markets as demand resources. No notification or submittal is
required pursuant to this PP5-1, for demand resources that are not comprised of generation.

**2.4** **Protection Systems**

Any addition of, functional change in, or retirement of a Remedial Action Scheme or Automatic
Control Scheme (as described in Section 1 of Planning Procedure 5-5) requires submission of a
PPA. Such application will be treated the same as Section 2.2.

**2.5** **Interconnections Operating at 69 kV or Above with Non-Market Participants or Non-**
**Transmission Owners**

Interconnections operating at 69 kV or above with non-Market Participants or non-Transmission
Owners (such as a new connection with a neighboring Control Area) require a PPA to be approved
by the ISO.

**2.6** **Dynamic Controls System**

Any addition or significant change in a continuously acting control system and associated devices
that respond to normal and abnormal system conditions or events, so as to change the stability,
reliability, or operating characteristics of the bulk power system requires submission of a PPA. Any

18 Major change, as used in this sentence, is equivalent to a Qualified Change. Also, see Section 3.1.2, Level of analysis
required, in PP5-3.


-----

g g
Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

significant difference in a continuously acting control system and associated devices from those
parameters studied and approved under a PPA or otherwise conveyed to the ISO as part of the
Applicant’s ongoing data provision requirements requires submission of a new PPA to assess the
actual operating parameters. This includes, but is not limited to significant changes in control
systems associated with static var and synchronous compensators, HVdc, generator excitation
systems, power system stabilizers and turbine governor systems. Please note that the provisions
of Schedule 22, 23 and 25 of the ISO Open Access Transmission Tariff regarding modifications to
existing generators and Elective Transmission Upgrades must also be observed.

**3.0** **Retirements**

This section identifies when a PPA is required based upon the type and/or size of facility.

**3.1** **Requirements**

Generator retirements do not require the submission of a PPA. However, all requirements in the
ISO New England Manual for Registration and Performance Auditing (M-RPA) must be met.
Retirement of a capacity resource must follow the requirements of Section III.13 of the Tariff.

**4.0** **Facility Changes That Do Not Require Proposed Plan Applications or Revisions to**
**Previously Approved Proposed Plan Applications**

Facility changes, such as but not limited to the following, do not require PPAs or revisions to
previously approved PPAs:

    - Routine protection and relaying changes only if there will be no increase in the fault
clearing times and no material change in elements tripped for all events that would be
analyzed pursuant to the PPA process.

    - Minor adjustments of parameters of continuously acting control systems from what
had been previously approved under a PPA (However, such adjustments must be
conveyed to the ISO as part of the Applicant’s ongoing data provision requirements.)

    - Disconnect switches

    - Replacement in kind or with greater energy dissipation of surge arrestors

    - Station automation

    - SCADA

    - Communications

    - Metering

    - Rehabilitation with like equipment that does not affect transmission capability

    - Static wire changes

    - Counterpoise changes

    - Replacement in kind of line terminal equipment and bus conductor to increase thermal
capability (Such changes however require the Market Participant to submit revised
NX-9 data to the ISO in accordance with OP 16 “Transmission System Data”)

    - Reductions in capability that result from the retirement of the resource/asset

Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans

**5.0** **Application Forms**

Attachments 1, 2 and 3 are forms to be used to notify the ISO of proposed generation and
transmission changes.

**5.1** **Summary Statement**

Each application will include a summary statement describing the proposed change and its
purpose, and explaining its impact on the system, if any.

**5.2** **Design Voltage versus Initial Operating Voltage**

Where a transmission line will be operated initially at a voltage lower than its design voltage, both
voltage levels will be specified in the space provided. The procedure to be followed is determined
by the initial operating voltage. A separate PPA is required when the line is to be converted to the
higher voltage.

**5.3** **Protection System and Dynamic Control System Descriptions**

**5.3.1** **Protection System Description**

The relaying section of the transmission form will describe the types of line relaying, backup
relaying, communications and reclosing to be installed. Breaker failure protection also will be
described. Any protective system that requires remote tripping, runback, or fast valving of
generating equipment must be described in detail.

**5.3.2** **Dynamic Control System Description**

If applicable, a description of the equipment and design considerations must be provided. If
testing and maintenance is an important factor in the overall performance in mitigating any
adverse system impact, then a plan of the system testing and maintenance must be provided.

**5.4** **Transformer Description**

Transformer terminal voltages will be stated in the space provided, including tertiary winding, if
there is one. The type of transformer or transformer bank should be described in the ""comments""
section. A separate sheet may be used, if needed.

**5.5** **Application Identification**

A company identification number will be assigned to each application by the Market Participant or
Transmission Owner preparing it. The following codes will be used:

Units or Changes of Less Than 5 MW” should be submitted to the ISO. PPA forms may be found on
the ISO Website at:

[http://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/proposed-plan-applications.](http://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/proposed-plan-applications)

A Market Participant or Transmission Owner wishing to discuss a proposed project with the ISO
[should notify the ISO via the e-mail address ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com.](mailto:ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com)

**Submittal of Study Results and Proposed Plan Application Materials**

  - **Level 0 Analysis**

PP5-1 Section 4 lists the types of projects that do not require a PPA submittal under this
procedure. Pursuant to this procedure and procedure PP5-3, these types of project require
Level 0 analysis. However, subject to the provisions of PP5-1, a “Generator Notification
Form for Units or Changes of Less Than 5 MW”, should be submitted to the ISO for
proposed projects which are less than 5 MWs of new or increased generation. These
submittals shall be made to the ISO via the email address [ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com](mailto:ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com) for
ISO review and for RC distribution.

  - **Level I Analysis**

In the case of a project requiring Level I analysis, as defined in PP5-3, the PPA submittal is
for information only, and the reporting of any study results is not required. The Market
Participant or Transmission Owner may submit the PPA requiring Level I analysis directly to
the ISO for review and distribution. ISO may confer with potentially Affected Entities to
confirm that no reporting of analysis is required and that the project requires Level I
analysis.

The complete PPA package [20] for a project requiring Level I analysis shall be submitted to
[the ISO via e-mail to ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com and shall include:](mailto:ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com)

       - A cover letter that is addressed to the Chair of the Reliability Committee and
requests RC review under Section I.3.9 of the Tariff. The letter must identify the
project, the submitted PPA(s), the level of analysis (Level I), and additional related
materials that are being submitted.

       - PPA(s) completed in accordance with this PP 5-1.

       - One-line diagram(s) showing the proposed modification(s).

       - Additional materials related to the project, as may be requested by the ISO.

       - Once the project PPA package is deemed complete, the RC Secretary shall provide
the materials to the RC for their review.

  - **Level II or III Analysis**

A project requiring Level II or III analysis requires RC and ISO review.

20 Model submission in accordance with Figure 1 (and accompanying language) shall precede a PPA package submission.

along with the study report(s).[21] The complete study report(s) shall include a project
description of sufficient detail for review and one-line diagrams showing the elements
of the project, and sufficient reporting of the analyses performed to demonstrate that
the project will not have any significant adverse effects under Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.
The project description must include any additional upgrades necessary to mitigate any
adverse effects that may be identified during the review and any specific conditions
regarding the construction sequencing of the elements within the project and with the
elements of other projects that have been determined to have no adverse effects
under Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.

3) The ISO review will ensure consistency of the project description with the one-line
diagrams in the report. ISO Planning staff will ensure that the project report and draft
PPA(s) are consistent.

4) When the ISO confirms that the study results adequately support the project, it will
provide a recommendation letter to the RC indicating the project reports are complete
and that the project will not have any significant adverse effects pursuant to Section
I.3.9 of the Tariff. This recommendation letter will include any opinions expressed by
Affected Entities regarding significant impacts that they believe to be insufficiently
addressed.

5) After it has been confirmed that the study results adequately support the project, the
Market Participant or Transmission Owner may submit a letter requesting Section I.3.9
review of the project to the RC Chair. The letter must identify the project, the
submitted PPA(s), the level of analysis (Level II/III), the study report(s), and additional
related materials that are being submitted. The letter shall be submitted to the ISO by
[email to ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com.](mailto:ProposedPlans@iso-ne.com)

6) ISO Planning staff will provide to the RC Secretary the PPA(s), study report(s) and any
additional related materials that were identified in the letter to the RC Chair. The RC
Secretary will coordinate the RC review of the project with the project proponent.

**General Requirements**

The ISO will send an e-mail to the plan proponent to provide:

  - confirmation of receipt of the project PPA materials or any appropriate modifications to
the submitted materials; and

  - verification of the submittal date of the complete project PPA package appropriate for
review by the RC.

21 Model submission in accordance with Figure 1 (and accompanying language) shall precede a PPA package submission.

The ISO will update the base case model to be used in the activities described in this Planning
Procedure based on transmission upgrades, load forecast and other system changes as
appropriate. The ISO will also calculate inter-area and inter-zonal transfer limits as needed to
support the Forward Capacity Auction (FCA).

For New Generating Capacity Resources,[1] seeking qualification to participate in an FCA, an initial
interconnection analysis is required if the project is not in possession of a completed Feasibility or
System Impact Study under Schedule 22 -Large Generator Interconnection Procedures (LGIP) and
Schedule 23 Small Generator Interconnection Procedures (SGIP) of Section II of the Tariff
(collectively, (L/SGIP)). Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all New
Generating Capacity Resources where the total requested output is above the Capacity Network
Resource Capability (CNRC). Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all new
Active Demand Capacity Resources. No overlapping impact analysis is performed in the case of
imports qualifying for the Forward Capacity Market as Import Capacity Resources using existing
importing interfaces. For new Import Capacity Resources associated with an External Elective
Transmission Upgrade (External ETU) that is eligible for Capacity Network Import Interconnection
Service (CNIIS), [2] seeking qualification to participate in an FCA, an initial interconnection analysis is
required if the project is not in possession of a completed Feasibility or System Impact Study under
Schedule 25 - Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Procedures (ETU IP) of Section II of
the Tariff. Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all Import Capacity
Resources associated with an Eligible External ETU where the total requested output is above the
Capacity Network Import Capability (CNIC) of the Eligible External ETU. Also, de-lists and demand
bids seeking participation in either an FCA or an Annual Reconfiguration Auction may be rejected
for reliability reasons.

This document is intended to provide guidance for the conduct of these transmission planning
studies. Note that completion of studies in accordance with this guidance does not preclude the
possibility that some results may suggest the need for additional studies.

1 For clarity, a New Generating Capacity Resource includes a New Generating Capacity Resource that is associated with an Internal
Elective Transmission Upgrade (Internal ETU) in accordance with Schedule 22 or 23 of Section II of the Tariff.

2 External ETUs eligible for CNIIS are controllable Merchant Transmission (MTF) or Other Transmission Facility (OTF). In this Planning
Procedure, these External ETUs are referred to as “Eligible External ETUs.”

**2.0** **Timeline**

Network topology development and power system base case development will be performed in
preparation for each FCA and Annual Reconfiguration Auction in accordance with the procedures
outlined in this document. A load forecast for the New England Control Area, States, and sub-areas
for the appropriate Capacity Commitment Period will be represented in the base case model.
Transmission Owners will submit materials in support of transmission projects that are anticipated
to be in service by the start of the relevant Capacity Commitment Period. The ISO will update the
network topology model based on these submissions and other system changes as appropriate.

Forward Capacity Auction qualification analyses for New Generating Capacity Resources, new
Active Demand Capacity Resources and new Import Capacity Resources are initiated by the
submittal of a New Capacity Show of Interest Form by the Project Sponsor of the resource. New
Capacity Show of Interest Forms are due approximately 10 months prior to the FCA.

Participants submitting Ambient Air Static De-List Bids must submit qualification materials to the
ISO by the Existing Capacity Qualification deadline, which is approximately eight months before
the FCA.

Participants submitting Static De-List Bids, Export Bids, and Administrative Export De-List Bid must
submit qualification and cost materials to the ISO by the Existing Capacity Qualification deadline,
which is approximately eight months before the FCA.

Participants submitting Permanent De-List Bids, Retirement De-List Bids or substitution auction
(SA) demand bids must submit qualification and cost materials (as applicable) to the ISO by the
Existing Capacity Retirement Deadline, which is approximately 11 months before the FCA.

Dynamic De-List Bids are not qualified in advance of the auction and can be submitted during any
round of the primary auction of the Forward Capacity Auction in which prices are below the
Dynamic De-List Bid Threshold.

The timeline depicted in Table 1 shows the major planning activities and contingent system
planning activities associated with New Capacity Resource qualification and de-list bid review in
preparation for a single FCA.

transmission project, or relevant portion thereof, in the network model for the relevant Capacity
Commitment Period.

For transmission projects that are not developed through the competitive transmission process
pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4A of Attachment K, or where a competitively developed project
includes an upgrade(s) located on a PTO’s existing transmission system where the Selected
Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor is not the PTO for the existing system element(s) being
upgraded, around October 1st of each year, the ISO shall provide the Transmission Owners with:

a) The “preliminary list” of projects and/or project components. This list is the most current
Regional System Plan Project List (“RSP Project List”), which is deemed, by the ISO,
adequate to build the updated network model.

b) The most current list of certified projects and/or project components.

Each Transmission Owner shall review the lists and certify project(s) and/or project component(s)
based on their determination that a particular project or component will:

  - Achieve, or not, an in-service date no later than the first day of the relevant Capacity
Commitment Period, and

  - Have, or not, a material impact on the final network model and the studies performed with
it.

The responsible Transmission Owner(s) shall certify the project(s) and/or project component(s)
with the ISO by providing the detailed information described below, only if that information was
never provided as part of a prior certification or if the prior certification needs to be updated.

For each major project and/or project component being certified, the detailed information to be
provided to the ISO consists of:

  - For each component of the project, a Critical Path Schedule as described in the template
provided in “Template Schedule” in Appendix E of this procedure,

  - A FCM Network Topology Statement Letter, as contained in Appendix E, from a company
officer verifying that he/she has reviewed the schedule of each project component
submitted to the ISO, that he/she concurs that the schedule is achievable, and that it is the
intent of the Transmission Owner company to build the proposed transmission project in
accordance with that schedule.

This detailed information shall be delivered to the ISO no later than fifteen calendar days after the
request for certification by the ISO. If further requested by the ISO, the responsible Transmission
Owner(s) shall also provide incremental data needed to update the ISO’s network model. This data
should be adequate for modeling the project in load flow, short-circuit and stability databases.

After receiving the above information, the ISO will review the most up-to-date Critical Path
Schedules and Statement Letter submitted for each major project and/or project component to
determine whether transmission projects or elements of transmission projects meet all of the
initial thresholds contained in Section III.12 of the Tariff. The ISO will use the evaluation criteria
contained in Section III.12 of the Tariff to determine whether to include the transmission project
or element of the transmission project in the final network model for the relevant Capacity
Commitment Period.

Once this step is complete, the ISO will assemble the final network model for use in the relevant
Capacity Commitment Period studies described in this procedure.

**4.0** **Transmission Interface Limit Analysis**

The methodology used to determine transfer limits is contained in Appendix I of the Transmission
Planning Technical Guide.

**5.0** **Analysis of New Capacity Resources**

Any New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible
External ETU has a number of potential transmission planning impacts, as described in Table 3,
which must be studied before it can interconnect. A valid Interconnection Request for Capacity
Network Resource Interconnection Service, submitted and accepted in accordance with Schedule
22 (LGIP) or 23 (SGIP) or 25 (ETU IP) of Section II of the Tariff, is required in order to seek
qualification for the FCA. In the absence of a completed Feasibility Study or a completed System
Impact Study, an initial interconnection analysis under the Network Capability Interconnection
Standard (NCIS) is required for FCA participation. Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts
under the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard (CCIS) is required for all New Generating
Capacity Resources and Eligible External ETUs associated with Import Capacity Resources seeking
qualification for the FCA, other than imports seeking to qualify as Import Capacity Resources using
existing importing interfaces. Table 3 compares the scope of an initial interconnection analysis
under FCM with the full list of potential impacts studied under a System Impact Study.

All potential impacts of New Generating Capacity Resources and ETUs, including changes to
Existing Capacity if appropriate, are studied under either the L/SGIP or ETU IP. Analysis of New
Generating Capacity Resources and ETUs does not bypass the L/SGIP or ETU IP. Accordingly, all
New Generating Capacity Resources must complete the L/SGIP and all ETUs must complete the
ETU IP before becoming interconnected.

The analysis of overlapping impacts for new Active Demand Capacity Resources is described in
Section 5.8.4.

**5.1** **Interactions in the Review of New Generating Capacity Resources and Import Capacity**
**Resources associated with an Eligible External ETUs with De-list Bids**

Interactions in the review of New Generating Capacity Resources and Import Capacity Resources
associated with Eligible External ETUs with de-list bids are discussed in Section 10 of this
procedure.

**5.2** **Criteria**

The Initial Interconnection Analysis under the Network Capability Interconnection Standard is
performed consistent with criteria described in ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-6 (PP56): Interconnection Planning Procedure for Generation and Elective Transmission Upgrades.

For analysis of Overlapping Interconnection Impacts for New Capacity Resources, the following
criteria will be used:

    - Thermal Analysis

– Normal Rating – no contingency

– Long Time Emergency (LTE) rating – for contingencies

**5.3** **General Conditions for the analysis of New Generating Capacity Resources and Import**
**Capacity Resources associated with Eligible External ETUs under FCM**

    - Study period

– The study period will reflect the Capacity Commitment Period N (1 year from
June 1st Year N to May 31st Year N+1)

    - Transmission Topology

– The analysis will use the updated transmission topology as discussed in Section 3

    - Load level for States, Capacity Zones, and sub-areas

– For the initial interconnection analysis under the NCIS, load will be modeled at
100% of the 90/10 peak New England Control Area load, as projected in the most
recent approved forecast.

– For the overlapping impacts analysis under the CCIS, load will be modeled at
100% of the 90/10 peak New England Control Area load, as projected in the most
recent approved forecast.[6]

    - Existing generation

6 Limitations in deliverability associated with loading levels lower than the 90/10 forecast peak New England Control Area load are
addressed in the transmission planning process, as appropriate.

ISO-NE Public 12

g g g pp
Forward Capacity Market

– For the initial interconnection analysis under NCIS, existing generation will be
modeled at up-to [7] the established Network Resource Capability (NR Capability).

– For the overlapping impacts analysis under CCIS, existing generation will be
modeled at up-to the established CNRC.

    - Existing Eligible External ETUs

– For the initial interconnection analysis under NCIS, existing Eligible External ETUs
will be modeled at up-to the established Network Import Capability (NIC).

– For the overlapping impacts analysis under CCIS, existing Eligible External ETUs
will be modeled at up-to the established CNIC.

    - Queued generation and Eligible External ETUs assumptions

– Criteria for including queued generation and Eligible External ETUs (and any
associated upgrades) in the model shall be consistent with the criteria set forth
in Section III.12 of the Tariff, and will also reflect Queue Position, consistent with
the criteria used in the L/SGIP and ETU IP, where appropriate.

    - Generation and ETU retirement

– Retired generation and ETUs will not be modeled as existing in the base case
after the date for which the retirement takes effect.

         - For the overlapping impacts analysis under CCIS, this includes Permanent
and Retirement De-List Bids submitted for the studied Capacity
Commitment Period that are known by early July to be certain-to-occur.

    - Generation and Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU delists

– Generation and Import Capacity Resources associated with an Eligible External
ETUs that permanently de-listed in a previous year will be modeled as existing in
the base case for the purposes of initial interconnection analysis, but will not be
modeled for the purposes of overlapping interconnection analysis.

    - Demand Capacity Resources

– Existing Active Demand Capacity Resources, existing On-Peak Demand Resources
and existing Seasonal Peak Demand Resources participating in FCM will be
modeled in the base-case.

    - Contingencies

– All single-element contingencies and multiple-element contingencies relevant to
satisfy PP3, NPCC Directory 1 and NERC TPL-001.

7 The phrase “up-to” when used in this document means that the referenced element may be set at the limit or level described, or may
be set at a lower level if the lower level gives rise to a more limiting condition for the given study.

– The post contingency system will be analyzed, if appropriate, to confirm that the
system can be brought to a state that is prepared for the occurrence of a
subsequent contingency in the time required by, and using the actions allowed
in, the applicable ISO New England Planning Procedures and Operating
Procedures.

**5.4** **New Capacity Show of Interest Form – Submittal & Review**

Completed New Capacity Show of Interest Forms [8] must be submitted during the New Capacity
Show of Interest Submission Window.

The ISO will review the received form for completeness and technical coherence. The ISO may
contact the Project Sponsor with questions or requests for clarification regarding the information
submitted in the New Capacity Show of Interest Form. If the New Capacity Show of Interest Form
is incomplete and if the Project Sponsor does not respond to questions or requests for
clarification, then the form will not be accepted and ISO will do no further work on the application.

**5.5** **Review of Direct Connect**

Using the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form including the
information provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP as
appropriate, the ISO will review the feasibility of connecting the proposed New Generating
Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU associated with an Import Capacity Resource to the
proposed interconnection point. If an interconnection plan is not already developed and defined
under a corresponding Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP, the ISO may request,
through consultation with the Project Sponsor if necessary, detailed information regarding the
feasibility of connecting the resource to the point of common coupling. This information may
include: the distance between the resource and the point of common coupling, plans to deal with
obstacles and land-ownership issues between the resource and the point of common coupling and
plans to ensure the point of common coupling itself can accommodate the new interconnection.

If the ISO determines that there is insufficient information to determine the feasibility of
connecting the resource to the requested point of common coupling, or if the ISO determines it is
not feasible to connect the resource to the requested point of common coupling in time for the
commencement of the Capacity Commitment Period, then the resource will not be qualified to
participate in the FCA. Section 5.10 contains supplemental guidelines for determining if a
qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) could or could not be implemented in time for the
Capacity Commitment Period.

8 Project Sponsors are to submit New Capacity Show of Interest Forms through the FCTS. A sample New Capacity Show of Interest
[Form is available on the ISO website: https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/forward-capacity-market/?document-](https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/forward-capacity-market/?document-type=FCM%20Forms%20and%20Guides)

**5.6** **Location Determination for New Generating Capacity Resources and Import Capacity**
**Resources associated with Eligible External ETUs**

Using the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form, including the
information provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP as
appropriate, the ISO will determine the zonal location for New Generating Capacity Resources and
Import Capacity Resources associated with Eligible External ETUs. New Generating Capacity
Resources and Import Capacity Resources associated with Eligible External ETUs will be
determined to be in a single Load Zone if it can serve incremental load in that Load Zone, while
satisfying the deterministic criteria of PP3, NPCC Directory 1 and NERC TPL-001.

**5.7** **Initial Interconnection Analysis under the Network Capability Interconnection Standard**

Using the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form, including the
information provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP,
as appropriate, initial interconnection analysis is performed consistent with criteria and conditions
described in ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-6 (PP5-6): Interconnection Planning
Procedure for Generation and Elective Transmission Upgrades. The initial interconnection analysis
of a New Generating Capacity Resource or an Eligible External ETU will be performed at the
requested Network Resource Capability (NRC) or NIC of the proposed project, respectively.

For the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU, if the following
analysis has not been or will not be conducted as part of a Feasibility or System Impact Study
under the L/SGIP or ETU IP, the objective of the initial interconnection analysis is to identify if any
upgrades are needed to meet all of the following requirements:

a) Satisfy the thermal and short circuit performance requirements of PP3, NPCC Directory 1
and NERC TPL-001 on a regional (i.e., New England Control Area) and sub-regional basis,
subject to the conditions analyzed.

b) As a result of the addition of the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible
External ETU, the maximum collective change in the amount by which other Resources must
be re-dispatched to meet the Reliability Standards, does not exceed the capacity of the New
Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU, as measured by its intended high
limit. If the request for interconnection involves multiple generating units at a plant and the
applicant for interconnection controls all the existing generating units at that plant, the
Project Sponsor for interconnection shall specify the desired maximum output for the plant.

c) The proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU does not diminish
the transfer capability across any transmission line or relevant interface below the level of
achievable transfers during reasonably stressed conditions and does not diminish the
reliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk power supply system

ISO-NE Public 15

and its component systems. For a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource in an
exporting area, an increase in the transfer capability out of the exporting area, beyond the
existing export capability, is not required to meet this interconnection standard.

d) The addition of the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU
does not create a significant adverse effect on the ISO’s ability to reliably operate and
maintain the system.

e) Short Circuit analyses will demonstrate that short circuit duties will not exceed equipment
capability. All Resources that can physically and concurrently be in service, including those
with approved deactivated reserve status, will be modeled in service.

Section 5.7.1 contains a detailed discussion of the application of initial interconnection analysis if
the above analysis has not been or will not be conducted as part of a Feasibility or System Impact
Study under the L/SGIP or ETU IP. If such analysis determines that violations occur for a proposed
New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU which cannot be fixed in time for the
relevant Capacity Commitment Period, the resource will be qualified to participate in that FCA up
to the amount that the resource can operate without fixing the observed violations, unless that
level is less than the Resource’s Economic Minimum Limit. Section 5.10 contains supplemental
guidelines for determining if a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) could or could not be
implemented in time for the Capacity Commitment Period.

**5.7.1** **Detailed Methodology for Initial Interconnection Analysis under the Network Capability**
**Interconnection Standard**

**5.7.1.1.** **Network Capability Interconnection Standard Screening**

The goal of the NCIS screening portion of this procedure is to develop a list of potential
transmission line, equipment or interface loading problems, pre- or post-contingency, associated
with the New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU. The New Generating Capacity
Resource or Eligible External ETU that is modeled in the base case is called a “study resource.” [9] All
of the transmission lines, equipment and interfaces that are monitored for potential loading
problems are called “monitored elements.” These potential monitored element loading problems
are identified by developing stressed transfer conditions to the starting base case[10] and then
determining which monitored elements have the potential to overload due to the addition of a
study resource.

9 An Eligible External ETU will be modeled as an injection at the proposed interconnection point to the New England Control Area. The
contingency loss of the Eligible External ETU will model the effect of the loss of the relevant facility(ies) in the external control area.

10 The base case is developed in accordance with Section 3 and Section 5.3 of this procedure.

Using the list of existing generators in New England, the NCIS screen sorts the list of generators
from highest positive distribution factor (DFAX) [11] to highest negative DFAX for each monitored
element, pre- and post-contingency. The distribution factors are a measure of the responsiveness
or change in electrical loadings on monitored elements due to a change in output from each
generator in New England. The DFAX is expressed as a percent of the change in generation output.
The generators with a positive distribution factor DFAX are referred to as “harmer” generation
because increasing the output of these generators results in more flow on the monitored element
for the specified contingency. The generators with a negative DFAX are referred to as “helper”
generators because increasing the output of these generators reduces the flow on the monitored
element for the specified contingency. The NCIS screen is performed by completing a transfer
from a source of harmer generation to a sink of helper generation for each monitored element.
The study resource is included in the model in this step of the screen to ensure that cases are
identified where the study resource can act as a harmer generator on a potentially overloaded
monitored element. A list of potentially overloaded monitored elements is saved for use in the
remainder of the NCIS test.

**5.7.1.2.** **Network Capability Interconnection Standard Test**

This portion of the NCIS procedure starts from the list of potential monitored element problems
identified during the NCIS screening. A more reasonable set of stressed conditions, described in
the following paragraphs, are then applied to these monitored elements to determine if any
system problems are attributable to the study resource.

The percent loading on each monitored element is determined without the resource under study.
This will provide a base reference loading for the monitored element. The reference loading will be
developed by completing a transfer from a source of all harmer generation to a sink of all helper
generators. If there is not sufficient helper generation to turn off to accommodate the increase to
all harmer generation, then the transfer will continue from the worst harmer generators (highest
DFAX) to the harmer generators with the lowest DFAX. The transfer will be limited when any
monitored element that was listed as a potential overload in the NCIS screen reaches a loading of
100%.

Next, the percent loading on each monitored element that was listed as a potential overload in the
NCIS screen will be calculated by adding the additional flow resulting from the resource under
study to the base reference loading. The additional loading caused by the study resource is
calculated based on a transfer from the study resource to the next available helper generator. If all
helper generation was already reduced as part of the base reference transfer then additional
loading caused by the study resource will be calculated based on a transfer to the lowest DFAX

11 Unless otherwise explicitly stated, distribution factors are calculated using New England load as a reference.

harmer that was not already used as part of the base reference transfer. If no monitored elements
are overloaded, the resource has passed this test.

If any monitored elements are overloaded after the addition of the study resource, it will be
determined for each overloaded monitored element whether an equal or lesser amount of
generation can be reduced such that the loading on that monitored element is brought below the
applicable rating. For this re-dispatch test, helper generation should be increased in reverse order
from the helper generation that was reduced when the study resource impacts were determined.
If the monitored element loading can be brought below the applicable rating then this unique
dispatch will be applied to all other monitored elements to determine if any overload condition
exists on the other monitored elements. If any other overloads occur, then a different re-dispatch
solution will be reviewed to determine if all overloads can be alleviated. In all cases, re- dispatched
generation will be limited such that the total amount of MWs to be turned off to eliminate all
overloads does not exceed the size of the study resource. Thus, the unique dispatch is tested
against monitored elements that were listed as potential overloads in the NCIS screen associated
with the study resource.

**5.8** **Analysis of Overlapping Interconnection Impacts**

Using the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form, including the
information provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP as
appropriate, the analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts under FCM is intended to
determine if a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource, an Eligible External ETU associated
with an Import Capacity Resource or new Active Demand Capacity Resource provides incremental
capacity to the system in manner that meets CCIS established in the L/SGIP or ETU IP. This means
that a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or a proposed Import Capacity Resource with
an Eligible External ETU will be qualified at the level at which it can operate without re-dispatch of
other capacity resources as described in Section 5.8.1. New Active Demand Capacity Resources will
be analyzed in accordance with Section 5.8.4.

The qualification analysis of an Eligible External ETU will be performed at the lower of either the
requested CNIC of the Eligible External ETU or the MW quantity for the new Import Capacity
Resource associated with the Eligible External ETU. In the case where an Eligible External ETU has
multiple new Import Capacity Resources associated to it, the qualification analysis will be
performed at the lower of either the requested CNIC associated with the Eligible External ETU or
the sum of the MW quantities for the new Import Capacity Resources associated with the Eligible
External ETU.

**5.8.1** **Detailed Methodology for Overlapping Interconnection Impacts Analysis**

The overlapping interconnection impacts analysis is performed in the form of a group study
defined as the Capacity Network Resource (CNR) Group Study under the L/SGIP and ETU IP. The
CNR Group Study shall include: (i) all Interconnection Requests for CNR Interconnection Service
and CNIIS associated with New Capacity Show of Interest Forms submitted to the ISO during the
New Capacity Show of Interest Submission Window for the purpose of qualifying resources for
participation in the related FCA in accordance with Section III.13 of the Tariff; (ii) Long Lead Time
Facilities (Long Lead Facilities), in accordance with Section 3.2.3 of the LGIP and ETU IP, and (iii) all
interconnection requests submitted to Interconnecting Transmission Owners or their distribution
company affiliates pursuant to the applicable state tariff, rules or procedures associated with New
Capacity Show of Interest Forms submitted to the ISO during the New Capacity Show of Interest
Submission Window for the purpose of qualifying resources for participation in the related FCA in
accordance with Section III.13 of the Tariff. Section 4.1.1 of the LGIP, Section 1.5.2 of the SGIP and
Section 4.1.1 of the ETU IP describe how CNR Group Study order is established. Performance of
the CNR Group Study commences at the close of the Show of Interest Submission Window.

Where a relationship between an Internal ETU and a specific Generating Facility seeking CNRIS has
been established, the Queue Position rules in the L/SGIP and ETU IP determine the relevant order
in which the Generating Facility’s Interconnection Request and the Interconnection Request for
the associated Internal ETU will be included in the CNR Group Study to assess the Generating
Facility’s qualification in the FCM. When the Generating Facility and the associated Internal ETU
are at different Queue Positions, the Generating Facility’s and the associated Internal ETU’s
Interconnection Request will be included in the CNR Group Study at the lower of the Generating
Facility’s or the associated Internal ETU’s Interconnection Request Queue Position. It is possible
that an Internal ETU may support more than one Generating Facility seeking CNRIS. Where the
Queue Position for the Internal ETU’s Interconnection Request is lower than that of the associated
Generating Facilities, the Queue Positions for the Generating Facilities’ Interconnection Requests
will be used as a tie breaker to dictate the relative order in which the Generating Facilities’
Interconnection Requests will be included in the CNR Group Study.

Table 4 illustrates the examples of the resulting CNR Group Study Queue Positions in the case of a
single Generating Facility Interconnection Request associated with a single Internal ETU.

**Table 4**
**Overlapping Interconnection Impacts Analysis with ETU Study Order Example**

**5.8.1.1.** **Testing and Re-dispatch Restriction**

The percent loading on each monitored element[12] is determined without the study resource. This
will provide a base reference loading for the monitored element. The reference loading will be
developed by completing a transfer from a source of all harmer generation with a distribution
factor (DFAX) of 3% or greater for the given monitored element to a sink of all other generators.
This transfer will be limited when a monitored element including a modeled intrazonal stability or
voltage limited interface reaches a loading of 100% or when all harmer generation with a
distribution factor of 3% or above have been turned on up-to their established CNRC in the case of
an existing generator or at the requested CNRC in the case of a new generator.

Next, the percent loading on each monitored element will be calculated by adding the additional
flow resulting from the study resource to the base reference loading. The additional loading
caused by the study resource is calculated based on a transfer from the study resource to
generation that is not included in the list of harmer generation with a distribution factor (DFAX) of
3% or greater for the given monitored element.

**5.8.1.2.** **Transfer Level Test Conditions**

In order to determine the base dispatch within the Load Zone under study, the generators will be
dispatched, up to their CNRC, in a manner that reasonably stresses the system. Internal transfers
will be modeled to reflect various conditions ranging from 0 MW transfer up-to their transfer
limits. Imports from External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various conditions changing

12 As defined in Planning Procedure No. 10, Section 5.7.1

from 0 MW transfer up-to the associated capacity import limit. Internal transfers that are
constrained by the system’s voltage or stability performance will be monitored through the use of
internal proxy interfaces.

**5.8.1.3.** **Qualification Transmission Upgrade Identification**

For each dispatch that is simulated per Sections 5.8.1.1 and 5.8.1.2 above, when the study
resource is delivering its output, the list of those new overloads that result from the addition of
the study resource and any existing overloads that are worsened due to the addition of the study
resource will be recorded. The list will identify each recorded overload that meets at least one of
the following thresholds:

 - An overload greater than 10 MVA above the applicable thermal rating of the transmission
element; or

 - An overload greater than or equal to 2% above the applicable thermal rating of the
transmission element; or

 - A transfer above the interface transfer capability of the modeled intrazonal stability or
voltage-limited interface.

 - The study resource will be responsible for recorded overloads that meet any of the abovelisted thresholds where, in relation to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting:

   - The study resource has an observed distribution factor (DFAX) [13] greater than or equal to
3%; or

   - The study resource has an observed impact (as measured by DFAX times proposed MW)
greater than or equal to 3% of the applicable thermal rating of the transmission
element.

The study resource will not be responsible for increasing the transfer capabilities of interfaces that
form the boundaries between existing Load Zones. Where the addition of the study resource,
having been added as described in Section 5.8.1.1 above, results in a transfer across an interface
(that forms the boundary between existing Load Zones) that is higher than the interface transfer
capability, then other harmer resources with the lowest DFAX located on the same side of the
interface may be reduced to bring the transfer level back to the interface transfer capability.

**5.8.2** **Qualified New Generating Capacity Resources and Conditional Qualified New Capacity**
**Resources**

If the analysis determines that violations occur for a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource
or Eligible External ETU that is associated with a single Import Capacity Resource which cannot be
fixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, the resource will be qualified to
participate in the FCA up to the level that meets the CCIS without fixing the observed violations,

13 In this section exclusively, distribution factors are calculated using the study resource’s Load Zone as a reference.

unless that level is less than the Resource’s Economic Minimum Limit. Section 5.10 contains
supplemental guidelines for determining if a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) could or
could not be implemented in time for the Capacity Commitment Period.

If the ISO determines that because of overlapping interconnection impacts, New Generating
Capacity Resources or an Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU that
have otherwise met the requirements to participate in the FCA in accordance with SectionIII.13 of
the Tariff cannot provide the full amount of capacity that they each would otherwise be able to
provide in the absence of the other relevant Existing Generating Capacity Resources and New
Generating Capacity Resources seeking to qualify for the FCA, those New Generating Capacity
Resources will be qualified for participation in the FCA on the basis of their Queue Position, as
described in the L/SGIP and ETU IP, with priority given to resources that entered the queue earlier.

A New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible
External ETU that meets the requirements of Section III.13 of the Tariff, but that would not be
accepted for participation in the FCA as a result of overlapping interconnection impacts with
another resource having a higher priority in the Queue may be accepted for participation in the
FCA as a Conditional Qualified New Capacity Resource.

**5.8.3** **Detailed Methodology for restudy based on the results of the Forward Capacity Market**

The ISO shall complete a post-FCA restudy of the applicable Interconnection Studies and CNR
Group Study to determine the cost responsibility[14] for facilities and transmission upgrades
necessary to accommodate the Interconnection Request based on the results of the FCA or
Reconfiguration Auction through which the generator or Import Capacity Resource associated with
an Eligible External ETU received a Capacity Supply Obligation.

The restudy (to be conducted in accordance with the L/SGIP and ETU IP for the purposes of
determining the facilities and transmission upgrades required to meet the CCIS) shall include: (i) all
Interconnection Requests for CNR Interconnection Service that obtained a Capacity Supply
Obligation in the FCA or Reconfiguration Auction; and (ii) Long Lead Facilities, as provided in
Section 3.2.3 of the LGIP and ETU IP. Study resources will be included in the analysis based on their
Queue Position in the L/SGIP and ETU IP interconnection queue as described in Section 5.8.1 of
this procedure.

The restudy shall include cleared Retirement and Permanent De-List Bids and SA demand bids
from the FCA, when the inclusion of these cleared Retirement and Permanent De-List Bids and SA

14 Cost estimates for the facilities and upgrades identified in the post-FCA restudy are provided by the applicable Transmission

demand bids will reduce or remove the need for transmission upgrades identified in the pre-FCA
group study described in Section 5.8.1 of this procedure.

Note that the provisions of the L/SGIP and ETU IP are used to determine the transmission
upgrades required to meet the Network Capability Interconnection Standard. However, as a result
of the restudy, upgrades associated with earlier/higher-queued Generating Resources or Eligible
External ETUs may need to be advanced, in accordance with the provisions of construction
sequencing, by the study resource in order to achieve all its critical path schedule milestones in
time for its associated Capacity Commitment Period.

The results of the restudy will be included in the corresponding Interconnection Study report, as
appropriate.

The restudy results will provide the list of transmission upgrades required to meet CNR
Interconnection Service. These transmission upgrades must be included in the critical path
schedule of the New Capacity Resource in accordance with Section III.13.3 of the Tariff, where
progress on the completion of these transmission upgrades must be reported by the Project
Sponsor, not the interconnecting Transmission Owner(s).

**5.8.4** **Detailed Methodology for the Overlapping Interconnection Impact Analysis of New**
**Demand Capacity Resources**

Starting with the qualification review for the fifth Forward Capacity Auction for Capacity
Commitment Period beginning June 1, 2014, new Active Demand Capacity Resources will be
analyzed for overlapping interconnection impacts. New On-Peak Demand Resources and New
Seasonal Peak Demand Resources (collectively “Passive Demand Capacity Resources”) will not be
analyzed for overlapping interconnection impacts.

Using the methodology contained in Section 5.8.1, each Dispatch Zone will be analyzed to identify
whether any new resource could deliver capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is
interconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting. In those Dispatch Zones where,
because violations occur which cannot be fixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment
Period, no new resource could deliver capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is
interconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting, then, no new Active Demand
Capacity Resources within that Dispatch Zone will be qualified to participate in the FCA (or
applicable Annual Reconfiguration Auctions). To the extent that the new Active Demand Capacity
Resource could, without the inclusion of any other new resources submitted for qualification in
that Dispatch Zone, deliver any portion of its capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is
interconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting, then the full proposed amount of
the new Active Demand Capacity Resource shall qualify under the provisions of this Section.

ISO-NE Public 23

Using the methodology contained in Section 5.8.1, any individual new Active Demand Capacity
Resource that is identified as interconnecting at a single nodal location from which no new
resource could deliver capacity to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting (because violations
are identified which cannot be fixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period) will not
be qualified to participate in the FCA (or applicable Annual Reconfiguration Auctions). To the
extent that the new Active Demand Capacity Resource could, without the inclusion of any other
new resources submitted for qualification at that nodal location, deliver any portion of its capacity
from the nodal location to which it is interconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is
interconnecting, then the full proposed amount of the new Active Demand Capacity Resource shall
qualify under the provisions of this Section.

**5.9** **New Generating Capacity Resources and Import Capacity Resources associated with**
**Eligible External ETUs seeking Qualification to submit a Supply Offer for an Annual**
**Reconfiguration Auction**

New Generating Capacity Resources and Eligible External ETUs associated with an Import Capacity
Resource are analyzed for their ability to meet the CCIS in the FCA CNR Group Study and restudy
processes described in this Planning Procedure. A New Generating Capacity Resource or an Import
Capacity Resource associated with Eligible External ETUs that qualifies for an FCA but does not
achieve a Capacity Supply Obligation may elect to have its critical path schedule monitored by the
ISO pursuant to the provisions of Section III.13 of the Tariff.

A New Capacity Resource with a critical path schedule that is being monitored by the ISO and is
expected to achieve all its critical path schedule milestones (including completion of any
transmission upgrades necessary for the resource to obtain the requisite interconnection service)
prior to the start of the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, and for which the Project Sponsor
has met all relevant financial assurance requirements, will be qualified to take on a Capacity
Supply Obligation in an annual reconfiguration auction.

**5.10** **Supplemental Guidelines for determining if a QTU could or could not be implemented in**

Around July 15[th] of each year, the ISO shall provide the Transmission Owners with:

 - The preliminary list of violations from the initial interconnection analyses [15] that resulted or
were worsened from the proposed addition of New Generating Capacity Resource(s) and/or
Eligible External ETU(s) associated with an Import Capacity Resource in their respective
territory.

Upon receipt of the violations, each Transmission Owner shall review their list and perform an
implementation assessment identifying whether (1) sufficient transmission planning analysis has

taken place to identify a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) that addresses a given violation
and (2) if a QTU has been identified whether or not that QTU could or could not be achieved in
time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period.

The responsible Transmission Owner shall provide the detailed information described below to the
ISO:

 - For each violation, a “QTU Implementation Assessment” as provided in the template form in
Appendix F of this procedure.

 - In cases where the Transmission Owner indicates in the QTU Implementation Assessment that
a QTU could be in place in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, a FCM QTU
Statement Letter, as contained in Appendix F, from a company officer verifying that he/she
has reviewed the implementation assessment(s) for the QTU(s) and that he/she concurs when
a QTU(s) could be achieved in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period.

This detailed information shall be delivered to the ISO no later than thirty calendar days after
receiving the preliminary list of violations.

After receiving the above information, the ISO will review the implementation assessments and
Statement Letters. In determining whether the QTU(s) could or could not be implemented in time
for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, the ISO will consider the following non- exclusive
list of factors:

 - Complexity of the transmission planning analysis (review of different transmission alternatives
and I.3.9 review process)

 - Ease of siting and permitting

 - Ease of land and easement acquisition

 - Equipment procurement time

 - Ease of construction and characteristics of the required new facilities (for example, length of
new overhead line or underground cable)

 - Construction sequencing and time requirement

 - Need for significant outage scheduling

 - The extent to which issues such as those described in this list have already been addressed,
implemented or completed and/or the extent to which there are plans in place to address
issues such as those described in this list

QTU(s) frequently identified as required upgrades to interconnect generation and Eligible External

The probability of completing upgrades in time for the Capacity Commitment Period is, in general,
highest for the projects in Group “A”, relatively lower for projects in Group “B”, and lower still for
projects in Group “C”. The actual time to complete any project is subject to consideration of the
extent to which the project is already being implemented and/or consideration of the bulleted list
of factors identified above and the extent to which these factors have been or are planned to be
addressed, and must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The level of scrutiny applied by ISO-NE
in determining whether a project can be completed in time will be, in general, higher for the
projects in Group “C”, relatively lower for projects in Group “B”, and lower still for projects in
Group “A”.

Approximately one week after receiving the QTU Implementation Assessments, the ISO shall
provide the affected Project Sponsor(s) of a New Generating Capacity Resource(s) or an Import
Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU with (1) the preliminary list of
violation(s) from initial interconnection analyses that resulted or were worsened due to the
proposed addition of their New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource
associated with an Eligible External ETU project and (2) the QTU Implementation Assessment(s)
with regards to those violation(s). The ISO shall indicate based on the preliminary QTU
implementation assessment that has been performed if a QTU could or could not be implemented
in time for the start of the Capacity Commitment Period to address the given violation(s).

If, at any time after sending the preliminary list of violations, the ISO finds additional violation(s)
that resulted or were worsened from the proposed addition of New Generating Capacity
Resource(s) and/or Eligible External ETU associated with an Import Capacity Resource, the ISO
shall share that information with the affected Transmission Owner(s) and provide a reasonable
period of time to respond back to the ISO with a QTU Implementation Assessment and FCM QTU
Statement Letter for each violation as described earlier in this procedure. Upon receipt of this
information, the ISO shall review the implementation assessment(s) and Statement Letter(s) to
assess if a QTU could or could not be implemented in time for the start of the relevant Capacity
Commitment Period. Following this review, the ISO shall provide the affected Project Sponsor(s)
with the violation(s) that resulted or were worsened due to the proposed addition of their New
Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External
ETU project as well as the corresponding QTU Implementation Assessment(s).

If, at any time, a Transmission Owner or Project Sponsor of a New Generating Capacity Resource
or an Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU becomes aware of any
new information that may affect a QTU Implementation Assessment for a given violation, they
shall promptly share that information with the ISO. The deadline for submitting new information

– Sensitivity analyses at load levels lower than 100% of the 90/10 peak New
England Control Area Load will be considered when such lower load levels might
result in high voltage conditions, system instability or other unreliable
conditions.

    - Resource Assumptions

– All Existing Capacity Resources will be modeled at their Summer Qualified
Capacity for the primary auction of the FCA.

– Existing Capacity Resources and New Capacity Resources that acquired a
Capacity Supply Obligation in the primary auction of the FCA will be modeled at
their Capacity Supply Obligation in the SA of the same FCA.

– Resources that meet the requirements of section 8.1.2 of this planning
procedure will be modeled at their contractual obligation amount.

– Existing Capacity Resources will be modeled at the lesser of the Capacity Supply
Obligation or the Summer Qualified Capacity for the Annual Reconfiguration
Auction for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period in which review is being
performed.

    - Contingencies

– All single-element contingencies and multiple-element contingencies as
described in OP19, Appendix J and M/LCC 15 will be considered.

– N-1-1 contingency analysis will be performed for the relevant contingencies in
accordance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC),
Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) and ISO-NE standards.[22] The N-1-1
contingency analysis will be performed to identify element-out conditions
combined with system conditions and contingencies that could result in an
Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) [23] exceedance.

    - Transfer Level Assumptions

– Internal transfers will be modeled to reflect various conditions ranging from 0
MW transfer up-to their bidirectional limits.

22 NPCC Directory 1, ISO New England OP19 and M/LCC 15.

23 IROL is defined in the Glossary of Terms used in NERC Reliability Standards as “[a] System Operating Limit that, if violated, could
lead to instability, uncontrolled separation, or Cascading Outages that adversely impact the reliability of the Bulk Electric System.”

– Transfers from External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various
conditions ranging from 0 MW transfer up-to the total of ICR Tie Benefits [24] plus
either qualified Existing Import Capacity Resource(s) for the FCA or cleared
Import Capacity Resource(s) for the Annual Reconfiguration Auction, not to
exceed the interface transfer limit.

– Transfers to External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various conditions
ranging from 0 MW transfer up-to either the total of qualified Administrative
Export(s) for the FCA or the total of cleared Administrative Export(s) for the
Annual Reconfiguration Auction, not to exceed the interface transfer limit.

    - One critical generator in the electrical vicinity of the resource associated with the delist bid under review will be assumed out of service.

Appendix A of this procedure illustrates a detailed list of assumptions supporting the above
conditions.

**7.3** **Minimum MW Quantity Threshold**

No analysis is required to assess the individual impact of a de-list bid or demand bid with a MW
quantity smaller than 5 MW. However, analyses may be conducted to assess the cumulative
impact of such de-list bids and demand bids, in conjunction with other de-list bids or demand
bids.

For a full de-list or demand bid, the quantity analyzed is the resource’s Qualified Capacity, Capacity
Supply Obligation or the lesser of the two depending on the type of de-list or demand bid and the
timeframe of review, as shown in Appendix A.

For a partial de-list or demand bid, the quantity analyzed is the MW reduction of the de-list or
demand bid and applied to the resource’s Qualified Capacity, Capacity Supply Obligation or the
lesser of the two depending on the type of de-list or demand bid and the timeframe of review, as
shown in Appendix A.

**7.4** **Order of Review**

**7.4.1** **De-list Bids for a Forward Capacity Auction**

For a Forward Capacity Auction, de-list bids and demand bids will be reviewed in the order
prescribed by Section III.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1.

**7.4.2** **Demand Bids for an Annual Reconfiguration Auction**

For an Annual Reconfiguration Auction, demand bids will be reviewed in the order prescribed by
Section III.13.4.2.2(c) of Market Rule 1.

24 As part of the development of ICR and related values for each FCA and each ARA3, tie benefits from neighboring Control Areas to
New England are calculated using probabilistic analysis in accordance with the methodology described in Section III.12.9 of the Tariff.

**7.5** **De-list Bids Rejected for Reliability**

Pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1, de-list bids shall only be rejected for the sole
purpose of addressing a local reliability issue, and shall not be rejected solely on the basis that
acceptance of the de-list bid may result in the procurement of less capacity than the net Installed
Capacity Requirement or the Local Sourcing Requirement for a Capacity Zone.

For thermal analyses, the capacity associated with the de-list bid or demand bid under review will
be maintained to address local loadings beyond the applicable thermal rating of the Element
when the removal of the capacity results in either an increase to the loading beyond the
applicable thermal rating of the Element greater than 10 MVA or an increase to the loading
beyond the applicable thermal rating of the Element that is greater than or equal to 2% of the
Element’s applicable thermal rating.

De-list bids that retained their Capacity Supply Obligation as a result of a reliability review
rejection will be modeled as Existing Capacity in all subsequent reliability reviews performed for
the Capacity Commitment Period under consideration until the reliability need has been met.

Following each Annual Reconfiguration Auction, pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(e) of Market
Rule 1, the ISO will re-evaluate any and all de-list bids rejected for reliability reasons to determine
if the reliability need which caused the ISO to reject the de-list bid has been met as the result of a
new transmission project, formerly de-listed resources, New Capacity Resource(s) having obtained
a Capacity Supply Obligation or updates to all relevant assumptions. Rejected de-list bids will be
re-evaluated in the order that was used in the initial review and described in Section
III.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1.

Where a request for proposal (RFP) under Section 4 of Attachment K has been issued in response
to a de-list bid rejected for reliability reasons, the ISO’s re-evaluation of the rejected de-list bid
may consider:

1. Whether there are responses to the RFP with in-service dates prior to the relevant
Capacity Commitment Period for the rejected de-list bid and the ISO determines that
some of those responses, including the Backstop Transmission Solution, are reasonably
likely to be in-service prior to the relevant Capacity Commitment Period for the rejected
de-list bid; and

2. Whether some of such responses are expected to address the reliability need(s) set forth
in the RFP.

In such cases, responses to the RFP may be determined to be timely and sufficient to meet the
reliability need caused by the rejected de-list bid.

Pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(f) of Market Rule 1, should the local reliability issue that caused
the ISO to reject the de-list bid be satisfied prior to or during the Capacity Commitment Period,

then the resource shall retain its Capacity Supply Obligation through the end of the Capacity
Commitment Period for which it was retained for reliability. Resources that submitted Permanent
De-List Bids or Retirement De-List Bids shall be permanently de-listed or retired as of the first day
of the subsequent Capacity Commitment Period (or earlier if the resource sheds the entirety of
the Capacity Supply Obligation as described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3(a)(ii) or Section
III.13.2.5.2.5.3(b)(ii)).

**7.6** **Stakeholder Review**

In accordance with Section III.13.1.8.(e) of Market Rule 1, the ISO shall post on its website no later
than three Business Days after the Existing Capacity Retirement Deadline information (aggregated
by Load Zone) concerning Permanent De-List Bids and Retirement De-List Bids, including
Permanent De-List Bids and Retirement De-List Bids entered from the prior FCA. The ISO will
provide written notice to each affected Transmission Owner and the Reliability Committee after
making this posting.

The ISO will consult with the impacted Transmission Owners after the Internal Market Monitor
(IMM) provides their cost determination (early July timeframe) for Retirement De-List Bids and
Permanent De-List Bids before finalizing the review of each de-list bid. The ISO will consult with
the impacted Transmission Owners after the Static De-list Bid finalization window[25] (early October
timeframe) for Static De-List Bids, Export Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids[26] before
finalizing the review of each de-list bid. The ISO will consult with the impacted Transmission
Owners during the auction (early February timeframe) for Dynamic De-List Bids before finalizing
the review of each de-list bid.

**7.6.1** **Reliability Review of Static De-List Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids at or**
**below the FCA Starting Price, and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List**
**Bids with Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement**
**Determination Notifications and Export Bids that are below the FCA Starting Price**

Studies to evaluate Static De-List Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids at or below the FCA
Starting Price, and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices Contained in
the Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications and Export Bids that are
below the FCA Starting Price will be completed in accordance with Section 7 of this procedure
which outlines the scope, study assumptions, and methodology that will be used in assessing the
reliability need. For the specific case of Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with
Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications that are
below the FCA Starting Price, the joint scoping process involving the ISO and the Transmission

25 Pursuant to Section III.13.1.2.3.1.1 of the Tariff, after receipt of the IMM cost determination in the late September timeframe, a

Owners and described in Section 7.6.2 of this procedure may also be used in assessing the
reliability need. Prior to the start of any de-list bid analyses, the ISO will present to the Reliability
Committee the specific assumptions that will be used, including a detailed list of new transmission
projects, as determined in accordance with Section 3 of this planning procedure, that will be used
in the relevant Forward Capacity Auction network model.

The ISO will review study results with the affected Transmission Owners as they become available.
The ISO will also provide the affected Transmission Owners a reasonable period of time to review
such results and an opportunity to discuss the results of the ISO’s determination with the ISO prior
to the relevant Forward Capacity Auction for Static De-List Bids and Administrative Export De-List
Bids at or below the FCA Starting Price, and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids
with Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications and
Export Bids that are below the FCA Starting Price and during the Forward Capacity Auction for
Dynamic De-List Bid requests.

The affected Transmission Owners will communicate their opinion regarding the determination
assessment of the de-list bid requests to the ISO.

If, at any time, an affected Transmission Owner becomes aware of any new information that may
affect the determination of a de-list bid request, they will promptly share that information with
the ISO. If, at any time, the ISO becomes aware of any new information that may affect the
determination of a de-list bid request, they will promptly share that information with the affected
Transmission Owner.

The ISO will provide a summary of accepted de-list bids and the details of rejected de-list bids to
the Reliability Committee at their first meeting following the ISO’s auction results filing with FERC.
The Reliability Committee shall provide formal input and advice to the ISO with regard to rejected
de-list bids after the relevant FCA through an advisory vote. Any member of the Reliability
Committee shall provide on-going input and advice to the ISO through comment as appropriate
by requesting the Chair of the Committee to include a specific rejected or accepted de-list bid as
an item for discussion at a future meeting of the Reliability Committee.

**De-List Bids where the Participant has opted into a Reliability Review**

For resources submitting a Retirement De-List Bid or Permanent De-List greater than the
minimum MW quantity threshold described under Section 7.3 of this procedure the following
steps will be taken. The ISO will discuss with the affected Transmission Owners the scope, study
assumptions, and methodology that will be used in assessing the reliability need beyond what is in
this planning procedure, as well as to develop a schedule for the review. In accordance with the

Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA) Section 3.09 the ISO and Transmission Owners shall
cooperate, in good faith, to evaluate each Retirement De-List Bid and Permanent De-List Bid. If
the ISO and affected Transmission Owners do not reach consensus, the ISO will determine the
study characteristics and will delineate the affected Transmission Owners’ concerns and rationale
in the final study.

The ISO will review study results with the affected Transmission Owners as they become available.
Following the dissemination of the Internal Market Monitor’s Retirement Determination
Notifications and the opt-in period to have the resource reviewed for reliability described in
Section III.13.1.2.4.1(a) or Section III.13.1.2.4.1(b), the ISO will finalize the reliability review for the
following de-list bids to determine if the resource is needed for reliability: (1) Retirement De-List
Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement
Determination Notifications that are at or above the FCA Starting Price; and (2) Permanent De-List
Bids and Retirement De-List Bids for which the Participant has opted to have the resource
reviewed for reliability as described in Section III.13.1.2.4.1(a) or Section III.13.1.2.4.1(b). The ISO
will provide the affected Transmission Owners a draft determination report for these de-list bids
within a reasonable period of time prior to the Reliability Committee meeting at which these delist bids will be subject to an advisory vote.

The affected Transmission Owners will communicate their opinion regarding the determination
assessment of these de-list bid bids to the ISO. If the ISO and affected Transmission Owners do
not agree regarding a reliability need determination, the ISO will acknowledge the affected
Transmission Owner’s perspective in its final report to the Reliability Committee.

If, at any time, an affected Transmission Owner becomes aware of any new information that may
affect the determination of a de-list bid request, they will promptly share that information with
the ISO. If, at any time, the ISO becomes aware of any new information that may affect the
determination of a de-list bid request, they will promptly share that information with the affected
Transmission Owner.

The Reliability Committee shall provide formal input and advice to the ISO through an advisory
vote regarding the review of Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices
Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications that are at or
above the FCA Starting Price and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids where the
Participant has opted into a reliability review prior to the ISO making a formal determination
regarding the reliability impacts of these de-list bids where, pursuant to Section
III.13.1.2.3.1.5.1.(b) of Market Rule 1, notification to the requesting Lead Market Participant shall

**8.0** **Interactions in the Review of New Capacity Resources and De-list Bids**

In preparation for the FCA, New Capacity Resources and potential cumulative or overlapping
impacts of New Capacity Resources will be analyzed as described in this procedure. De-lists or
retirements and potential cumulative impact of de-lists or retirements will generally be
studied separately and independently from New Capacity Resources, other than for the
interactions and interdependences described in the following sections.

**8.1.1** **Inclusion of Permanent and Retirement De-List Bids in the Review of New Capacity**
**Resources**

As described in Section 5.3 of this Planning Procedure, Permanent and Retirement De-List Bids
submitted for the studied Capacity Commitment Period that are known by early July to be certainto-occur are included in the overlapping impact analysis for New Capacity Resources.

**8.1.2** **Inclusion of Additional Resources in Reliability Reviews**

In a manner consistent with Section 4.1(f) of Attachment K of the Open Access Transmission
Tariff, the ISO will consider resources that are contractually committed pursuant to a statesponsored Request for Proposal or a similar financially binding contract in the ISO's planning
process. In preparation for a FCA, prior to conducting any analyses outlined in Section 7 of this
Planning Procedure, the ISO will review all such resources identified for the Needs Assessments
Study process that continue to meet the requirements of Section 4.1(f) of Attachment K of the
Open Access Transmission Tariff.

The ISO will consider these resources in its FCA reliability reviews based on the resources’
expected in-service date.

**8.1.3** **Inclusion of Potential New Capacity Supply Obligations in the Reliability Review of**
**Demand Bids in Substitution Auctions and Annual Reconfiguration Auctions**

When performing the reliability review of demand bids in a SA or reconfiguration auction, resources
that would be cleared to acquire new Capacity Supply Obligation MW are modeled at the total
Capacity Supply Obligation that they would attain once clearing of the auction is complete.

**9.0** **Non-Commercial Capacity Deferral Notifications**

Non-Commercial Capacity Deferral notifications, as defined in Market Rule 1, Section III.13.3.7,
like de-list bids, are reviewed in accordance with Section 7 of this procedure. The ISO will review
the specific reliability need with and seek feedback from the Reliability Committee regarding the
review of Non-Commercial Capacity Deferral notifications prior to the ISO making a formal
determination regarding the reliability impacts of a given Non-Commercial Capacity Deferral
notification where, pursuant to Section III.13.3.7 of Market Rule 1, notification to the requesting

1 For import-constrained Capacity Zones, qualified Administrative Export De-List Bids are not taken into account during the calculation of Transmission Security Analysis
requirements for the Forward Capacity Auction. The descending clock auction software used during the Forward Capacity Auction procures both the capacity required for the
Administrative Export De-List Bids and the Local Sourcing Requirement for the import-constrained Capacity Zone.

2 Depending on the type of analysis, these will be applied by either modeling the Resource’s Capacity at a reduced amount or by modeling equivalent discrete outage(s).
3 Subject to periodic review and update.
4  Published in the Regional System Plan and updated in the most recent Reliability Committee presentation regarding Step 1 of the Capacity Zone Development.
5  Analyses that are performed before the FERC Information Filing is published rely on the Qualified Existing Capacity known at the time of the analysis.

**19.0** **Appendix I – Fuel-Security Reliability Review for Forward Capacity Market (FCM)**

**1.0** **Purpose**

This appendix will establish the process and criteria for evaluating the reliability impacts of FCM (a)
Retirement De-List Bids, (b) substitution auction demand bids, (c) bilateral transactions, and (d) all
reconfiguration auction demand bids on system fuel security as required by Section III.13.2.5.2.5A
of the Tariff. The process for this fuel-security reliability review is set out in this Appendix I to PP10.

**1.1** **Term and Sunset of this Appendix I**

This appendix shall remain in use for the period described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.a of the Tariff.

**2.0** **Timeline and Applicability**

The timeline for and applicability for fuel security reliability reviews is set out at Section
III.13.2.5.2.5A.b of the Tariff.

**2.1** **Input Review with Stakeholders**

Each year in February or March, prior to the commencement of the fuel-security reliability review
for a FCA, the ISO will consult with the Reliability Committee regarding the inputs described in
Section 3 below.

**2.2** **ISO Notification of Fuel-Security Reliability Review Results to the Participant**

The results of the fuel-security reliability review will be quantified in an ISO issued determination
notification that is issued pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.f of the Tariff.

**2.3** **ISO Notification and Review of Determination with Stakeholders**

The ISO determinations described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.f will be reviewed with stakeholders, at
the Reliability Committee, in the same general timeframe that resources retained for transmission
security are reviewed, as outlined in PP-10, Section 7.6.

**2.3.1 Informational Analysis Presentation**

An informational fuel-security reliability review with a 50/50 peak load forecast from the most
recent CELT will also be performed in all scenarios analyzed for units retained utilizing the 90/10
peak load forecast, and included in with the materials described in this Section 2.3.  This analysis is
not used for unit retention determinations.

For the FCA 14 fuel-security reliability review cycle, an additional informational analysis will be
performed to simulate the impact of approximately 500 MW of offshore wind that is being
developed under a state procurement program with an in-service date for the winter under study,
but which has not yet received all required state approvals.


-----

Forward Capacity Market

**3.0** **Fuel-Security Reliability Review**

The fuel-security review consists of an hour-by-hour chronological simulation of the New England
electric supply systems for a winter period from the beginning of December through the end of
February. One of the key assumptions driving the results of the review is the amount of natural gas
available for electric generation.

**Natural Gas Assessment**

The fuel-security reliability review models natural-gas consumption on a daily basis. The primary,
independent variable is average daily temperature converted to heating degree days (HDD). Given
a daily temperature, the total gas demand for Residential, Commercial and Industrial (RCI)
customers is established based on updated gas demand reports and the sources for serving this gas
demand are based on the following:

  - Gas from Pipelines – The first source utilized for natural gas comes from the pipeline supply
encompassing Algonquin, Tennessee, Iroquois, and Portland Natural Gas Transmission
System (PNGTS).

  - Satellite Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) – On cold days (HDD), the model assumes that
injections from gas Local Distribution Company (LDC) satellite LNG storage facilities will be
activated in order to support the LDC behind-the-meter operations by increasing pressures
and limiting draws from pipelines in accordance with their contractual agreements and
supply plans. An LNG injection curve shall be constructed from the implied satellite LNG
injections calculated for the past five winters using forecast LDC gas demand for the
modelled Capacity Commitment Period and actual non-power gas demand determined
using publicly available bulletin board data.

  - Pipeline Connected LNG – Any remaining needs of the LDCs are supplied by large pipelineconnected LNG facilities such as Canaport, Distrigas and the Excelerate buoy.

Once the gas LDC demand (i.e., New England and New Brunswick gas demand) is served, the
remaining amount of natural gas for electric generation – and its supply source – can be
determined. If the gas LDC demand was ‘low,’ then pipeline gas may be available for electric
generators. After the pipeline gas is fully utilized, the next source of gas for electric generation
would be from unused pipeline connected LNG facilities subject to the daily “cap” on LNG
vaporization as addressed in Section B below. The maximum daily amount of gas available from
both classes of supply to the electric sector is then passed to the Electric Sector Dispatch Model.

**Electric Sector Dispatch Model**

The maximum daily amount of natural gas available to the electric power sector is allocated to each
hour using a heuristic algorithm to shape the available gas. The algorithm provides more gas during
the higher load hours and less gas to lower load hours with the goal of ensuring that all of the
available gas would be consumed each day before turning to other liquid fuel resources. Separate


-----

Forward Capacity Market

accounting is done for gas supply available from pipelines and gas supply available from pipeline
connected LNG facilities.

The amount of gas available from both sources in each hour is converted to available electric MWh
in each hour assuming an average conversion efficiency of 7,400 Btu/kWh. This amount of MWhs
from available gas is used by the dispatch algorithm where pipeline gas is used first and then
resources using gas from vaporized LNG facilities are dispatched subsequently.

**_Electric Sector Load_**

The New England electric loads used in the model are based on the loads and temperatures
experienced during the winter of 2014/15. All winter hourly loads are then scaled using the ratio of
the forecast 90/10 peak demand (net of Energy Efficiency) for the applicable future Capacity
Commitment Period year to the observed peak in the historical benchmark year (2014/15).

**_Reserves_**

Thirty-Minute Operating Reserves and Ten-Minute Operating Reserves are being served by the
distillate oil-only resources with the highest heat rates, which are the best suited to providing
reserves.

**_Resource Availability_**

The fuel-security model does not assume any scheduled outages. Random unavailability due to
forced outages and derates is treated by “derating” the capacity of a resource by an Equivalent
Forced Outage Rate on Demand (EFORd) utilizing the ISO’s Generating Availability Data System
(GADS) data as described below.

**_Dispatch Order_**

Energy to serve the load comes from dispatching the resources in an economic order reflecting
winter conditions. Wind and Photovoltaics (PV) are dispatched first using profiles adjusted to
reflect expected amounts of those resources as described in the Static Inputs below. Other
renewables such as wood, biomass and municipal solid waste are then assumed to be dispatched
next, followed by nuclear resources and then coal generators; the Seasonal Claimed Capability of
these resource technologies is derived from the most recent CELT report as described in the Static
Inputs below. Pumped storage and other electric storage resources are dispatched next using daily
storage profiles used to reflect the characteristic operation of each resource type by storing energy
during low load periods and generating energy during the higher load periods as described below in
the Static Inputs.

Next, conventional hydro-electric generation is dispatched at an hourly profiled MW amount as
described in the Static Inputs below. This is followed by the dispatch of imports as a constant MW
resource in accordance with assumptions set forth in Section A below.

Next, the aggregate natural gas only resources are dispatched on pipeline gas in each hour, subject
to the hourly availability of pipeline gas MWhs. If there is remaining pipeline gas, it is used by the


-----

Forward Capacity Market

gas-fired, dual-fueled, combined-cycle resources to serve remaining energy demands until the gas
MWhs are exhausted.

Next in the dispatch order are the natural-gas only resources that would be dispatched on pipelineconnected-LNG gas, subject to the hourly availability of pipeline-connected-LNG gas MWhs. If
there is remaining pipeline-connected-LNG gas, it is used by the gas-fired, dual-fueled, combinedcycle resources to serve remaining energy demands until the pipeline-connected-LNG gas MWhs
are exhausted.

If more load still needs to be served, the dual-fueled combined cycle resources that have not been
previously dispatched on pipeline or pipeline-connected-LNG are dispatched on distillate oil,
subject to fuel in a specific generator’s associated oil tank as determined in Section A below.

Next in the dispatch order are the distillate only generators not held for reserve and residual oil
generators, subject to fuel in a specific generator’s oil tank determined in Section A below.

Last, the dispatch of demand response resources will be applied to the unmet energy.

Any remaining energy not served is then converted to MWhs of Operating Procedure – 4 Actions,
Ten-Minute Reserve Depletion and Operating Procedure – 7 Load Shed.

The following inputs will be used when performing the fuel-security reliability reviews.

**A.** **STATIC INPUTS**

A fuel-security reliability review will utilize the following static inputs:

**i.** **Peak Load: This is calculated using the draft CELT Net 90/10 winter peak load values**
(including the effects of energy efficiency) presented to the Planning Advisory Committee
(PAC) during the spring of the year when the fuel security reliability review is performed,
which is prior to the annual issuance of the final values in the CELT report released on May
1.

**ii.** **Winter Energy Profile: The hourly system demand from the 2014/2015 winter will be used**
to create an hourly load shape by using the ratio of the CELT peak load for the relevant
Capacity Commitment Period to the 2014/2015 winter peak load. The hourly temperature
from the 2014/2015 winter will be used as the modeled hourly temperature.

**iii.** **LDC Gas Demand: The LDC winter peak demand for the modeled Capacity Commitment**
Period will be set annually based on vendor supplied information with growth for the
modeled period adjusted to not exceed the addition of any new gas supply capacity. The
LDC winter peak demand shall be capped at the value utilized in the prior year’s fuel
security reliability review (i.e., for the prior Capacity Commitment Period). Both New
England and New Brunswick LDC gas demand shall be accounted for in the modelling.

**iv.** **Pipeline Capacity: Set for modeled Capacity Commitment Period based on vendor-supplied**
information annually.


-----

Forward Capacity Market

**v.** **Satellite LNG facility vaporization: Set for modeled year based on vendor-supplied**
information annually.

**vi.** **Oil inventory levels: Tank inventory levels for oil-only resources and dual-fuel resources**
that operate primarily on oil during the winter shall be set to levels determined using the
2017/2018 winter fuel surveys submitted to the ISO in December. Tank inventories then
will be assumed to be replenished with 202 barrels per hour when the reorder level is
reached. The reorder level is provided using the results of the 2017/2018 winter fuel
survey.

**vii.** **Resource Seasonal Claim Capability:  The winter Seasonal Claimed Capability (MW) from**
the most recently published CELT report for all Existing Generating Capacity Resources
qualified for the instant FCA and energy-only generators active in ISO New England markets.
For non-commercial Existing Generating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT report
and energy-only generators that are in service but are not in the CELT report, the fuelsecurity reliability review will use the resource’s winter Qualified Capacity and the winter
SCC value (as of the fifth business day in May), respectively.

**viii.** **PV Forecast: For photovoltaic resources accounted for in the PV forecast, the fuel-security**
reliability review will use draft CELT values as presented to the PAC during the spring of the
year when the fuel security reliability review is performed, which is prior to the annual
issuance of the final values in the CELT report released on May 1. For in-service
photovoltaic resources not accounted for in the draft forecast values, the fuel-security
reliability review will use the nameplate values. For non-commercial photovoltaic Existing
Generating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT report, the fuel-security reliability
review will use the nameplate equivalent of the resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation
received in the most recent Forward Capacity Auction.

**ix.** **Wind Resource Nameplate: For wind resources accounted for in the most recently**
available CELT report and in-service wind resources not accounted for in the most recently
available CELT report, the fuel-security reliability review will use the nameplate values. For
non-commercial wind Existing Generating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT
report, the fuel-security reliability review will use the nameplate equivalent of the
resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation received in the most recent Forward Capacity
Auction.

**x.** **Sun Profile: The ISO will use the observed hourly profile from the winter of 2014/2015,**
adjusted to reflect the expected performance of the fleet assumed in service in the study
year, and updated annually.

**xi.** **Onshore Wind Profile: The ISO will use the observed hourly profile from the winter of**
2014/2015, adjusted to reflect the expected performance of the fleet assumed in service in
the study year, and updated annually.

**xii.** **Offshore Wind Profile: The ISO will use an hourly profile reflecting the expected**
performance of the fleet assumed in service in the study year as though it had been in
operation in the winter of 2014/2015, and updated annually.

**xiii.** **Demand Response Resources: The winter Seasonal Claimed Capability (MW) reduction**
value from active Demand Response Resources.

**xiv.** **EFORd: The ISO calculated Equivalent Forced Outage Rate on Demand (EFORd) utilizing the**
ISO’s Generating Availability Data System (GADS) data. EFORd will be applied to Seasonal
Claimed Capability, vii above, in the same manner it is applied for ICR and related values
calculations.

**xv.** **OP-4 Action MW: Estimated hourly MW relief for each action of OP-4.**

**xvi.** **Export Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids: Resource capacity associated with**
Export Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids qualified for the instant FCA will not be
included as capacity available to ISO to meet internal New England load, and these bids will
not be modeled.

**xvii.** **Pumped Storage and Other Electric Storage Devices: Set to levels using a daily storage**
profile that reflects the characteristic operation of the resource by storing energy during
low load periods and generating energy during the higher load periods.

**xviii.** **Conventional Hydro-Electric Generation: This resource is dispatched at an hourly output**
based on the observed hourly profile from the winter of 2014/2015, adjusted to reflect the
expected performance of the fleet assumed in service in the study year, and updated
annually.

**B.** **VARIABLE INPUTS:**

The fuel-security reliability review will consider the following variable inputs:

**i.** **Imports: Imports for this review will be defined as the total net flow across the NY-NE, NB-**
NE and HQ-NE interfaces. The values are set at 2,800 MW, 3,000 MW, and 3,500 MW and
will be utilized in separate scenarios.

**ii.** **LNG Injections: LNG injections for this review will be defined as the total LNG injected into**
the pipeline transmission system by the region’s three available LNG facilities, Canaport,
Distrigas and Buoy. The values are set at 0.8 Bcf, 1.0 Bcf and 1.2 Bcf and will be utilized in
separate scenarios.

**iii.** **Dual-Fuel resource tank inventory: For dual-fuel resources that operate primarily on**
natural gas during the winter, tank inventory for this review will be defined as a multiplier
for the onsite fuel-storage tank of the individual resource. The values are set at 1.25 and 2
and will be utilized in separate scenarios. When the value is set to 1.25, the onsite available
fuel for the individual resources will be set to 125% capacity of the individual resources’

Forward Capacity Market

tanks at the start of the analysis. When the value is set to 2, the onsite available fuel for the
individual resources will be set to 200% capacity of the individual resources’ tanks at the
start of the analysis.

The variable inputs in this section can be changed based upon historical trends, new infrastructure,
fuel surveys and as the ISO deems necessary, and the information will be provided to the Reliability
Committee in accordance with section 2 above.

**C.** **SYSTEM MODEL STARTING POINT**

With the exception noted below, the model will include all new resources that have a binding and
enforceable contract under a state procurement to be in-service by January 1 of the associated
Capacity Commitment Period that, by the time the fuel-security reliability review is conducted,
have (i) submitted the certification described in Section 8.1.2 of PP10, pursuant to Section 4.1(f) of
Attachment K to Part II of the Tariff, or (ii) demonstrated the contractual requirements through
submittal of an order or other similar authorization from the appropriate state regulatory agency,
along with a copy of the contract, by five business days prior to the Existing Capacity Retirement
Deadline. The model will take into consideration any obligation(s) to operate under these
contracts, or lack thereof, regarding energy deliveries specific to winter stress conditions being
reviewed for fuel security.  With respect to (ii) above, the demonstration can be made by the state
regulatory agency authorizing the contract, by a transmission company or electric distribution
companies that is a counterparty to the contract, or by a third-party organization representing the
interests of the New England states regarding energy-related issues (e.g., NESCOE). For FCA 14,
offshore wind resources shall have until April 23, 2019 to demonstrate the contractual
requirements stated above. If demonstration of the contractual requirements is received after
April 23, 2019, the ISO will make reasonable efforts to account for the resource in the model (e.g.,
scenario analysis), to the extent that doing so will not interfere with the ability of the ISO to
complete the analysis and issue its determination by 90 days after the Existing Capacity Retirement
Deadline.

**Examples of Completing Table 1**

1. Use OP-24C to determine if relay outages must be reported for the

transmission element.

2. After determining that relay outages must be reported, consider the scheme.

For example, Figure 1 has System A and System B, each with its own
communication channel.

**_Figure 1 - Two Redundant Pilot Line Protection Schemes_**

3. In Figure 1, two separate pilot line protection schemes (e.g. POTT, DCB,

DUTT, Line Differential) are used along with a separate communication
channel for breaker failure transfer trip (BF TT). If one of the pilot line
protection schemes, either System A or System B is taken out-of-service, then
the answer to Question 4 should be “Yes”, the answer to Question 5 should
also be “Yes” and the answer to Question 6 should be “Yes” as long as BF TT
remains in-service. If non-redundant breaker failure relay (BF) is removed
from service, then the answer to Question 5 should be “No.” If BF TT were
removed from service, then the answer to Question 6 should be “No.”

**_Figure 2 - Single Pilot Line Protection Scheme (Separate Transfer Trip Channel)_**


-----

4. In Figure 2, a single pilot line protection scheme is used along with a

separate communication channel for BF TT. If the pilot line protection
scheme is taken out-of-service, then the answer to Question 4 should be
“No,” the answer to Question 5 should also be “Yes” and the answer to
Question 6 should be “Yes” as long as BF TT remains in-service.

**_Figure 3 - Single Pilot Line Protection Scheme with Shared Transfer Trip Channel_**

5. In Figure 3, a single pilot line protection scheme is applied with shared

communications to transfer the trip signal to a remote breaker (BF TT). To
complete Table 1 for this scheme with the communication removed from
service, the answers to both Questions 4 and 6 should be “No.” The answer
to Question 5 should be “Yes.”

6. In Figure 3, a non-redundant BF relay is taken out-of-service. The pilot line

protection scheme and the BF TT will not be impacted by that outage, so the
answers to Questions 4 and 6 should be “Yes”. The answer to Question 5
should be “No”. Note that a single BF relay out-of-service does not make the
whole BF TT scheme unavailable. Other local and remote breakers will key in
the trip signal to BF TT if needed. Hence, the answer to Question 6 should be
“Yes.”.

**_Figure 4 - Step Distance Relay_**


-----

7. In Figure 4, a step distance relay is employed with no BF TT. If the step

distance relay is removed from service, then the answers to Questions 4, 5
and 6 should all be “N/A.”

8. For bus or transformer differential relays taken out-of-service the answers to

Questions 4, 5 and 6 should all be “N/A.”

9. The answer to Question 10 provides information to perform the steady-state

analysis. In order to properly simulate the stuck breaker contingency with BF
relay out-of-service, all elements tripped in this contingency must be listed. A
single line-to-ground fault on either side of the stuck breaker with its BF relay
out-of-service should be considered; such a fault will most likely require
remote tripping of all transmission elements emanating from the substation.

10. The answer to Question 8 confirms that the entity submitting the outage

application has appropriately coordinated scope of protection work with other
entities operating other terminals of the same transmission facility. If the
transmission facility is owned by one entity, then no such coordination is
required and the answer to Question 8 should be ‘N/A’.

**I.** **OVERVIEW**

ISO uses Manual Response Rate (MRR) data to determine Real-Time Dispatch
Instructions and account for on-line Generator Asset Ten-Minute Spinning Reserve,
Ten-Minute Non-Spinning Reserve, and Thirty- Minute Operating Reserve. In order to
verify that MRRs are consistent with Generator Asset performance, ISO shall conduct
MRR auditing by analyzing a Generator Asset’s historical response to electronic
dispatch signals. Dispatches that are indicative of a Generator Asset’s response in a
certain initial output range shall be analyzed for MRR when the Generator Asset is
required to increase MW output. This analysis shall take into account the statistical
variation of a Generator Asset’s response to dispatches, and includes a time-varying
weighting factor for those dispatches to determine a probabilistic weighted average
MRR for a Generator Asset, given an initial starting output. The ISO’s analysis is
described in Sections II and III of this Appendix.

**II.** **DISPATCH INTERVAL CRITERIA**

1. An electronic dispatch instruction to an on-line Generator Asset shall be referred to

as a qualified dispatch interval (QDI) and utilized for MRR evaluation if all the
following conditions are met:

a. Generator Asset is dispatchable

b. Current output is greater than or equal to Economic Min

c. Desired Dispatch Point (DDP) is greater than current output

d. DDP remains greater than current output for at least five minutes, and

e. Change in DDP is greater than 5 times MRR or a defined percentage of the

Generator Asset’s dispatchable range (whichever is less). The defined
percentage shall be based upon initial Generator Asset output as follows:

Bin # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

DDP change as 10 10 10 10 10 9 7 6 5 5
percentage of
dispatchable
range

Where each bin is 10% of the Generator Asset’s dispatchable range in MW

2. A QDI shall end for a particular Dispatch Instruction when any of the following

conditions are met:

a. Dispatch Instruction has been in effect for 15 minutes

b. DDP minus Generator Asset output is less than 0.5% of Economic Max, or

c. DDP is less than Generator Asset output

3. A Dispatch Instruction that meets the above criteria may be removed from

the MRR analysis if that instruction was not indicative of normal MRR
response. This may occur because of conditions such as, but not limited

|Bin #|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|DDP change as percentage of dispatchable range|10|10|10|10|10|9|7|6|5|5|


-----

to, resource maintenance, outages, fuel switching, or manual dispatch.

**III.** **CALCULATING MANUAL RESPONSE RATE**

1. A QDI evaluation will produce an MRR as a ratio of the change in MW output to the

amount of time required to effect that change in minutes.

2. The QDI and corresponding MRR value shall then be binned, based upon the

Generator Asset’s initial output, into one of ten equal MW bins across the
Generator Asset’s largest observed dispatchable range from Economic Min to
Economic Max.

3. Statistical MRR outliers shall be removed from the analysis by removing the tails of

the statistical distribution using the mean value and standard deviation.

_N_ _j_ _N_ _j_

###### j  1  (R j i,  j )2,  j  1  R j i, N j i1 N j i1


Where:

 = mean value

 = standard deviation

Nj = number of samples in a MW range
Rj = set of ramp rates allocated to a MW range
I= sample number
j=MW bin number

Samples that are within two standard deviations of the mean shall be retained

so that retained samples satisfy: j 3 j  _Rj_  j  3 j

Where: 3 2.0

Resulting set of the ramp rates in the bin _j without outliers is_ _R_ _j_

with the number of samples _N_ _j_


###### N


4. Each sample shall be weighted for age of the sample. The older the sample, the

lower the weight in the probability distribution.

The weighting factor for each sample is:

###### w j i,  e(T0 T stj i, )

Where:

α = 0.05
To – T[st] = the number of months since the sample was taken


##### R


-----

5. A weighted average MRR shall then be determined for each MW range for a

Generator Asset using the weighting factor and probability distribution.

###### N j

#  q j i,  w j i,  R j i,

#### R*j  i1 N j

#  q j i,  w j i,

###### i1

Where:

###### q j i,  {0,1} = factor used to exclude a sample manually

6. The resultant MRRs shall then be evaluated for consistency and reasonability by

analyzing any MRRs that:

a. Have less than five samples in that MW bin, or

b. Deviate more than 50% from the MRRs in the adjacent MW bins.

7. MRRs that are found to be inconsistent with adjacent bin values shall be removed

from the final resultant MRR values.

8. The MRR cap value shall be determined as the maximum of the remaining MRR

values over the Generator Asset’s dispatchable range.

I, as a representative of the Lead Market Participant of the generator assets,, affirm the following:

I understand that ISO requires Generators to regularly achieve Claimed Capability when called upon to do so. I
understand that Capabilities must reflect, with reasonable accuracy, a Generator's physical characteristics, the
interdependence of common elements and auxiliaries located within a multi- Generator generating station, and the
deployment of operating personnel required for Generator and/or station achievement of Claimed Capability.

I understand that the capability of the individual common elements associated with a group of stations or Generators
should be established recognizing the impact of each element on the capability of the entire group.

I affirm that the SCC of the Generator at this station is not limited in any way by common elements, commonly
assigned staffing or any other factors. Such common elements include but are not limited to:

    - Staffing;

    - Steam headers;

    - Stacks and other boiler auxiliaries;

    - Condenser cooling equipment (spray modules, pumps, screens, inlets, discharge canals, cooling tower,
etc.);

    - Common river flowage or watershed; and

    - Other environmental concerns

I understand that if circumstances change which will have an impact on the interdependence of common elements and

auxiliaries located within this multi-Generator generating station, and/or the deployment of operating personnel
required for Generator and/or station achievement of Claimed Capability, or any other factors that may limit station
output that I must notify ISO immediately.

I understand that ISO may use its discretion to conduct an additional CCA test, in addition to other CCA tests

conducted, if it believes that additional verification of claimed capability is necessary.

_Please provide any additional information relevant to this certification._

-----

**I. DAILY CYCLE HYDRO GENERATORS**

Calculations will use daily mean river flow rate data over a 20-year historical period.
The flow duration data will be constructed from the most relevant United States
Geological Survey (“USGS”) flow gage, with appropriate scaling to account for
differences in drainage area. Ratings for such resources are established and
updated in calendar years that are evenly divisible by five. Capability will include the
effects of natural stream flow, pondage, and eligible upstream storage. Details of
these capability calculations are contained in Section II of this Appendix.

A non-Intermittent Power Resource daily cycle hydro asset summer Seasonal
Claimed Capability (SCC) Audit value is calculated from the average of the four
summer monthly ratings (June - September), and the winter SCC Audit value is
calculated using the average of the eight winter monthly ratings (October - May).

The following variables must be defined prior to calculating the monthly capability.
All data must be provided by the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) except for flow
and gage data, which will be provided by the ISO staff.

**_Max. Capacity - power, in kW, produced when the Flow at Max. Capacity_**
passes through the Generators at the station. Max. Capacity represents an
average value that properly takes into account typical differences in head
experienced under normal operating conditions.

**Flow at Max. Capacity - the amount of water flow, in cubic feet per second (cfs),**
required to produce the power specified in Max. Capacity.

**_Conversion Factor - kilowatts of power produced at the station per cfs of flow._**
The default value of Conversion Factor is Max. Capacity / Flow at Max.
**_Capacity, however, the Lead MP may supply an alternative value that is more_**
representative of typical operating conditions.

**_Minimum Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, needed to support_**
power production. Station power production is assumed to be zero whenever the
flow is less than Minimum Flow.

**_USGS Flow Gage - the most relevant USGS flow gage._**

**_Flow at Gage - the amount of water flow, in cfs, at the gage that is surpassed_**
50% of the time during the month, based on 20 years of flow data for the month.
Daily cycle hydro capability calculations will use daily mean river flow rate data,
over a 20-year historical period. The monthly flow rate used will be the 50[th]
percentile value of the full set of daily mean values for that month over the
20-year historical period (i.e., the value that is exceeded for 50% of the time
during the month). For example, for the month of June, the number of daily mean
flow rate data points would be 20 (years) * 30 (days) = 600. These 600 daily
mean flow rates for the month of June would be sorted, lowest to highest. The
flow rate assumed for that month would be the 50[th] percentile value (value
number 300 out of 600, i.e., 50% of the values are lower than this value and 50%


-----

of the values are higher than this value). The flow estimates will be updated in
calendar years that are evenly divisible by 5. ISO staff will provide this
information.

**_Gage Drainage Area - the stream natural drainage area, in square miles, at the_**
gage. ISO staff will provide this information.

**_Station Drainage Area - the stream natural drainage area, in square miles, at the_**
station.

**_Unusable Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, required at all times_**
that is unavailable for generation, in order to maintain sufficient flow in a structure
such as (but not limited to) a diversion canal. Leakage is also included in this
factor.

**_Usable Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, required at all times, but_**
is available for generation during generation periods.

For Governance Participants claiming supplemental pond storage at the station, the
following must be provided:

**_kWh in Full Pond - the energy produced, in kWh, if the water in the pond_**
between maximum (full) and minimum pond elevation limits is used to generate at
**_Max. Capacity without using any natural inflow. In effect, it is the electrical_**
energy equivalent of the pond. kWh in Full Pond is assumed to be Cubic Feet of
Usable Pond * Conversion Factor / 3600.

For Governance Participants claiming supplemental upstream storage, the kWh in
**_Upstream Pond is calculated in accordance with the Section II of this Appendix._**

**_kWh in Upstream Pond - the amount of energy produced, in kWh, if the water in_**
upstream storage is used to generate power of the amount in Max. Capacity at
the lower station without using any natural flow. In effect, it is the electrical
energy equivalent of the upstream storage. This model will create an equivalent
pond at the station for the upstream storage.

The following are calculations that will be used during the station evaluation:

**NOTE**

**x = y means x is assigned the value y**

**_Monthly Capability - the monthly station rating, in kW, which will ultimately be_**
determined by this process.

**_Test Hours - the number of hours simulated as a demonstration test period. The_**
demonstration test period is two hours for Winter Period months (i.e., October May), and four hours for Summer Period months (i.e., June - September).


-----

**_Flow at Station - the amount of monthly water flow at the station, in cfs, which is_**
surpassed 50% of the time during the month.

_Flow at Station = Flow at Gage * Station Drainage Area / Gage Drainage_
Area.

**_Hours in Full Pond - hours of generation available from a full pond without use_**
of natural flow when generating at Max. Capacity. Hours in Full Pond
represents the usable water between maximum (full) pond and minimum pond
elevation requirements.

**_Hours in Full Pond = kWh in Full Pond / Max. Capacity_**

**_Hours in Upstream Pond - hours of generation available from upstream storage_**
without use of natural flow when generating at Max. Capacity.

**_Hours in Upstream Pond = kWh in Upstream Pond / Max. Capacity_**

The following steps are repeated for each month to determine capability for daily
cycle hydro generating stations:

a. Assign the station maximum capability if the natural monthly water flow at the

station is greater than what the station requires at maximum generation. If the
station meets this criterion, no further evaluation is needed.

If Flow at Station > (Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow)

Then Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity

If Flow at Station < (Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow)

Then proceed to (b.)

b. If step (a.) determined there is insufficient natural monthly water flow at the

station, the natural water flow shortage needs to be determined.

**_Natural Flow Shortage = Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow -_**
**_Flow at Station_**

If pond storage is claimed, go to step c.

If pond storage is not claimed, but upstream storage is claimed, go to step e.

If neither pond storage nor upstream storage is claimed, go to step h.

c. Since the station has insufficient monthly natural water flow for Max.

**_Capacity, and there is a pond at the station, the number of hours that the_**
pond will supplement the natural monthly water flow needs to be determined.
It is assumed that the station will generate at maximum output while the pond
is supplementing the natural water flow.

**_Hours of Supplementary Pond = (Hours in Full Pond * Flow at Max._**


-----

**_Capacity / Natural Flow Shortage)_**

d. If the number of hours that the pond supplements the natural monthly water

flow is greater than the test period, assign the station maximum capability
provided that the monthly natural water flow will refill the pond for a
demonstration the same time on the following day.

If Hours of Supplementary Pond > Test Hours

Then, Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity

and go to step i to perform a refill check.

If pond supplement is insufficient for Max. Capacity, and upstream storage is
claimed, go to e.

If pond supplement is insufficient for Max. Capacity and upstream storage is not
claimed, go to h.

e. The station has insufficient natural water flow, and insufficient (or no) pond

storage, and the station has upstream water storage. This algorithm simplifies
upstream storage by modeling it as an extension of the pond at the station.
The variable kWh in Upstream Pond contains constraints related to the
output of the upstream storage, and transit time.

**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = Hours in Upstream_**
**_Pond * Flow at Max. Capacity / Natural Flow Shortage_**

f. Constrain the Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage so that it only

provides energy after the pond at the station is depleted.

If Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage > Test Hours - Hours of
**_Supplementary Pond_**

Then Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = Test Hours **_Hours of Supplementary Pond_**

g. The station will be at maximum capability if the pond and upstream storage

supplement the natural monthly water flow for the entire test period.

If (Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary
**_Upstream Storage) = Test Hours_**

Then Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity

and go to step i to perform a refill check.


-----

If this step is reached, maximum generation cannot be sustained throughout
the simulated test period. The generation will be computed in three (3) parts:

h.

   - Generation that is produced by:

      - natural flow,

      - the pond, and

      - upstream storage.

Diagram 1 shows what each part of the calculation represents:

Diagram 1: Time Profile of Station Output

The calculations for each are:

Natural Flow:

Case 1: (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) > Minimum Flow
Generation = (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) * Test Hours *
**_Conversion Factor_**

Case 2: (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) < Minimum Flow
Generation = (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) * (Hours of
**_Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage) *_**
**_Conversion Factor_**

Pond Supplement:

It is assumed that the station generates at Max. Capacity.
Generation = Hours of Supplementary Pond * Natural Flow Shortage

   - Conversion Factor

Upstream Storage:

It is assumed that the station generates at Max. Capacity.


-----

Generation = Hours of Supplementary **_Upstream Storage * Natural_**
**_Flow Shortage * Conversion Factor_**

The Monthly Capability rating is then determined as the sum of the
energies derived from each source divided by the number of hours in the
test.

**_Monthly Capability = (Natural Flow Generation + Pond Supplement_**
Generation + Upstream Storage Generation) / Test Hours.

i. Upon reaching this refill check step, the Monthly Capability is correct,

provided that the pond and upstream storage used can be refilled by natural
flow if the same test was repeated on the same hour of the following day. For
simplicity, it is assumed that the same natural flow will refill both the pond and
upstream storage.

The refill check assumes that minimum possible water use occurs in between
simulated test periods. The total outflow of water passing through and around
the station is calculated:

**_OutFlow = (Test Hours *Flow at Station) + (Natural Flow Shortage*_**
(Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary Upstream
**_Storage)) + ((24 - Test Hours) * (Unusable Flow + Usable Flow))_**

(Test Hours *Flow at Station) represents the water passing through
the generator station during the test.

(Natural Flow Shortage * (Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours
**_of Supplementary Upstream Storage))_** represents the supplemental
pondage and upstream storage used during the test period.

((24 - Test Hours) * (Unusable Flow + Usable Flow)) represents the
water which must pass the station in between test periods on
successive days.

j. If OutFlow does not exceed the natural inflow during a day (24 * Flow at

**_Station), then the Monthly Capability previously calculated is correct. If_**
**_OutFlow exceeds the daily inflow, then the Monthly Capability is scaled_**
downward to honor the refill requirement as follows:

**_Monthly Capability = Monthly Capability * (24 * Flow at Station) /_**
**_OutFlow_**

k. The SCCs are calculated as follows:

Summer SCC = Average of four summer Monthly Capabilities (June –
September)

Winter SCC = Average of eight winter Monthly Capabilities (October –
May)


-----

**II. UPSTREAM STORAGE MODEL**

The upstream storage model is a “no spill” model, which assumes that all ponds in
the river system are full at the start of the modeling period. It models a “slug” of
water being released and moving downstream. By the time the slug of water moves
downstream to reach the facility being rated, the flow rate is assumed to be equal to
the smallest flow for maximum generation among all intermediary generators
including the upstream facility whose contribution is being computed.

The model computes a contribution from each upstream storage facility for each 30minute interval within the test period. These contributions include the flow limitations
in the river system as described above, the flow to achieve maximum generation at
the station being rated, the hours of storage in the upstream pond for the upstream
facilities, and the transit times to the station being rated.

First, each upstream generator contribution is determined in each 30-minute interval
assuming an infinite pond size at the upstream storage facility. Then the cumulative
unconstrained energy from the upstream facility is computed as the test period
progresses. Then, an energy limit is computed for each upstream facility based on
the hours of storage in the upstream pond when the upstream station generates at
maximum, the transit time to the station being rated, the flow for maximum
generation at the station being rated, and the maximum generation at the station
being rated.

The cumulative energy delivery from an upstream storage facility to the station being
rated with a 30-minute resolution is then constrained by the effective energy limit for
the upstream storage energy ultimately produced at the station being rated.

Contributions in each 30-minute interval from relevant upstream storage facilities are
then summed, and the kWh of effective upstream storage is ultimately computed.

A. Required Information

The following information must be provided for the station being rated:

**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station - the output of the station being rated, in_**
kW, corresponding to the maximum flow.

**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station - the output of the station being rated, in_**
kW, corresponding to the maximum flow.

The following information is needed for each upstream facility:

**_Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility - power, in kW, produced when the_**
**_Flow at Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility passes through the_**
generators at the upstream station.

**_Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility represents an average value that_**
properly takes into account typical differences in head experienced under
normal operating conditions.


-----

**_kWh in Upstream Storage Facility - the amount of energy produced, in_**
kWh, if the water in upstream storage is used to generate power at the
upstream facility of the amount specified in Max. Capacity of the
**_Upstream Facility without using any natural flow._**

**_Flow at Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility - the amount of water flow,_**
in cfs, required to produce the power specified in Max. Capacity of
**_Upstream Facility._**

**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage - the hours for which the_**
pond of the upstream facility can sustain full output without any natural
flow. This is used to ensure that the energy limitations of the upstream
storage facility are respected within the methodology.

**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = kWh in Upstream_**
**_Storage Facility / Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility_**

**_Transit Time - The time, in hours, required for water from the upstream_**
storage facility to reach the pond of the station being evaluated. In order
to simulate simultaneous requests for maximum generation for the same
peaking period, upstream storage is assumed to be unavailable for
generation for the station being studied until the Transit Time expires. An
upstream pond cannot supplement the station being examined if Transit
**_Time is greater than Test Hours._**

**_Test Hours - the number of hours simulated as a demonstration test_**
period.

**_Minimum Flow at Max. Capacity - when computing the kWh available to_**
the station being rated from an upstream storage facility, Minimum Flow
**_at Max. Capacity is the smallest value found among the flows for_**
maximum capacity for the upstream storage facility being evaluated for its
contribution and that of any intermediary stations. This is the means by
which the no-spill requirement of the model is enforced.

B. Calculations

1. **Compute the contribution from each upstream facility in each 30-**

**minute interval of the test period. The contribution is set to zero if the**
30-minute interval is such that the slug of water being modeled will not
arrive during the interval due to the Transit Time. If the transit time is
such that there is some overlap with the interval, then for simplicity it is
assumed that the slug of water is fully available in the interval. For
example, a transit time of 59 minutes renders that upstream storage
unavailable for the first 30-minute interval, and then fully available during
subsequent intervals. When the upstream storage is available to provide
energy in a 30-minute interval, its energy is computed by multiplying the
maximum capacity of the station being rated by the ratio of the most
restrictive maximum flow in the path from the upstream storage to the flow


-----

for maximum output at the station being rated. This energy is constrained
by the maximum capacity of the station being rated. These calculations
do not include any energy limitations of the upstream storage.

**_Kilowatt-Half Hours from Upstream Pond =_**

**_Lesser of_**

**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station * (Minimum Flow at Max._**
**_Capacity_** **_/ Flow at Max. Capacity of Rated Station)_**

**_And_**

**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station_**

2. **Compute cumulative energy for each upstream storage facility. For**

each 30-minute interval, compute the cumulative energy that would be
delivered from the upstream storage as if it had an infinite pond size, as
time progresses through the test period.

3. **Determine energy limit for each upstream storage facility. Categorize**

the energy limit determination into one of four mutually exclusive
scenarios. The energy limit is computed based on rules applicable to
each scenario.

**_Scenario A applies when the most constraining upstream flow for the_**
upstream facility exceeds or equals the flow for maximum generation
at the station being rated, and this condition will persist from the time
the transit time expires until the test period expires. In Scenario A, the
energy limit equals

**_Energy Limit A = Max. Capacity of Rated Station * (Test Hours_**
**_– Transit Time)_**

**_Scenario B applies when the most constraining upstream flow for the_**
upstream facility exceeds or equals the flow for maximum generation
at the station being rated, but this condition will not persist from the
time the transit time expires until the test period expires. This scenario
recognizes that the water arriving at the station being rated from the
upstream facility in excess of that needed for maximum generation at
the station being rated will be “ponded” at the station for use after the
inflow from upstream storage goes to zero. Full output at the station
being rated is assumed for the lesser of these two periods:

**_Time B =_**

**_Lesser of_**

**_Test Hours_** **_– Transit Time_**

**_And_**

**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage + (Hours of_**
**_Supplementary Upstream Storage * ((Minimum Flow at Max._**
**_Capacity – Flow at Max. Capacity of Rated Station) / Flow at_**


-----

**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station))_**

**_Energy Limit B = Max. Capacity of Rated Station * Time B_**

**_Scenario C occurs when the constrained upstream flow is less than_**
the flow required for maximum generation at the station being rated,
but that lesser flow is sustainable through to the end of the test period
once it arrives at the station being rated. In Scenario C, the energy
limit is computed as:

**_Energy Limit C = Max. Capacity of Rated Station * (Minimum_**
**_Flow at Max. Capacity / Flow at Max. Capacity of Rated Station)_**

**_* (Test Hours_** **_– Transit Time)_**

**_Scenario D occurs when the constrained upstream flow is less than_**
the flow required for maximum generation at the station being rated,
but that lesser flow is NOT sustainable through to the end of the test
period once it arrives at the station being rated. In Scenario D, the
energy limit is computed as:

**_Energy Limit D = Max. Capacity of Rated Station * (Minimum_**
**_Flow at Max. Capacity / Flow at Max. Capacity of Rated Station)_**

**_* Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage_**

4. **Apply energy limits for each upstream facility. Apply the energy limits**

by comparing the cumulative unconstrained (from a total upstream storage
energy perspective) initial energy assignments with the applicable energy
limit from the upstream storage. The initial energy assignment is
unaltered if the energy limit has not been met. However, if the cumulative
energy in the 30-minute interval surpasses the energy limit, then the initial
energy assignment is reduced sufficiently to honor the energy constraint.

5. **Sum up the contributions within each 30-minute interval from each**

**upstream facility in the model. The sum of the contributions in each 30-**
minute interval is capped by the maximum capacity of the station being
rated.

6. **Determine the kWh in Upstream Pond for use in calculations. Sum**

up the capped energy values in each 30-minute interval, multiplying by
two to convert kW-half hours to kWh, to determine the usable upstream
storage.

**NOTE**

Upstream ponds without generators can be used by determining the hours of
supplemental upstream storage at the maximum allowable outlet flow and by using
that maximum allowable outlet flow in determining the Minimum Flow at Max
Capacity.

-----

**I.** **GENERAL REQUIREMENTS**

A. Two or more Assets in a single station or two or more stations, or portions of

combined-cycle generating stations modeled as multiple Assets, whose capability is
limited by common elements and/or commonly assigned staffing should establish
capability based on simultaneous CCAs.

B. Common elements include but are not limited to:

    - Staffing;

   - Steam headers;

    - Stacks and other boiler auxiliaries;

   - Condenser cooling equipment (spray modules, pumps, screens, inlets, discharge

canals, cooling tower, etc.); and

   - Common river flow or watershed.

C. The capability of the individual common elements associated with a group of stations

or Assets should be established recognizing the impact of each element on the
capability of the entire group.

D. Normal station service and unit auxiliaries (such as spray modules, cooling towers, or

other auxiliaries required by regulatory or governmental authority) should be in use
during the period when a CCA is conducted. Market Participants (MPs) may use
discretion when estimating station service for small (less than five (5) MW), unstaffed
hydro and/or internal combustion stations where station service is not accurately
metered and/or recorded on an hourly basis.

E. Multi-Generator stations must self-certify for the individual Generator Assets of the

station that the SCC of the Generator Assets at this station are not limited in any way
by common elements, commonly assigned staffing or any other factors. This
certification is provided by submitting the form found in Appendix E of this Operating
Procedure.


-----

**II. INDIVIDUAL ASSET TYPES**

A. In addition to requirements listed in Section I of this Appendix, the following

requirements, applicable to specific generator types, will govern capability
determination:

1. Steam Turbine Assets With No Steam Exports

**No adjustments for atmospheric and/or water temperatures, other than those**
specified in Section III.1.5.1.4 of Market Rule 1, will be made.

2. Steam Turbine Assets, Combined Cycle Assets, or Pseudo-Combined Cycle

Assets with Steam Exports

a. In instances where steam is exported for uses external to the electric power

facility, an adjustment must be made to the MW output demonstrated during a
CCA in order to normalize the SCC for steam exports by adjusting for the
difference between actual steam exports and “normal” steam exports. It is
expected that when a CCA is conducted or when the Asset is being
dispatched “in merit” based on its Supply Offer profile (which should be
consistent with and reflective of its contractual arrangements), the steam
exports of the facility will be managed so as to demonstrate the full level of
control by the facility operators over steam export rates, which is permitted by
contract so as to maximize electric output.

b. All Generator Assets with one or more steam turbines must self-certify that the

Generator Assets do not have steam exported for uses external to the electric
power facility that may affect the SCC, by submitting Appendix F of this
procedure to ISO.

1) In order to make the adjustment for steam exports, the Lead MP or its

agent, shall provide:

i. Statements of its Seasonal Claimed Capability Steam Demand

(SCCSD) for both the Winter and Summer Claimed Capability
Periods. The SCCSD for each seasonal period is the expected
(average) steam export during OP-4 or on-peak hours and is
determined as follows:

a) _Fully Interruptible. If steam exports can be fully interrupted at the_

direction of the Lead MP or its agent pursuant to dispatch orders
of the ISO based on the Asset’s Supply Offer profile or during any
and all actions of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4)., the SCCSD shall be
equal to zero.

b) _Fixed Amount Interruptible. If steam exports can be partially_

curtailed at the direction of the Lead MP or its agent pursuant to
dispatch orders of ISO based on the Asset Supply Offer profile or
during any and all actions of OP-4, the SCCSD shall be equal to
the average steam export rate during the on-peak hours of the


-----

SCC Period which actually occurred during the immediately prior
like period less the volume or proportion of steam which can be
curtailed based on the Asset Supply Offer profile or during any and
all actions of OP-4.

c) _Uninterruptible. If steam exports cannot be curtailed at the_

direction of the Lead MP or its agent, the SCCSD shall be equal to
the average steam export rate during the on-peak hours of the
SCC Period that actually occurred during the immediately prior like
period.

ii. For a new Asset, if actual average steam export data is not available,

the Lead MP will provide ISO with its best reasonable estimate of
steam exports for each SCC period, consistent with the degree to
which steam exports can be interrupted, as described above

iii. A table is to be provided with the appropriate Asset Registration

Form, showing output at various steam export levels (or, for combined
cycle or pseudo-combined cycle Assets, output at various steam
export and temperature levels). This steam-temperature-output table
would include expected output at the respective Seasonal (summer
and winter) Claimed Capability Steam Demand and, if applicable,
respective seasonal (90°F-summer and 20°F-winter) criterion
temperatures. (The same requirements on temperature adjustments
provided in III.1.5.1.1(c) of the Tariff should be followed). This table
must include the full range of possible steam exports, in increments of
5,000 lbs/hr (and temperatures, if applicable) associated with the full
range of possible MW output levels of the facility. (If necessary,
increments of other than 5,000 lbs/hr may be provided). An abridged
example of such a table, which also provides for the submittal of
SCCSD and Interruptible Steam Export (ISE) data is shown in Table
1.

2) ISE for both the Winter and Summer Claimed Capability Periods, is the

amount of steam demand contractually available during OP-4, CCAs, and
as offered economically. ISE, for each seasonal period, is the amount that
is available to be interrupted, while SCCSD is the expected amount of
steam export after exports are interrupted. For example, if steam exports
are normally 50,000 lbs/hr and are fully interruptible, then ISE = 50,000
and SCCSD = 0.

3) Within seven business days after a CCA is conducted on an Asset for

which adjustments must be made for steam exports, the Lead MP or its
agent will provide ISO with information on the average steam export rate
that occurred during the period of the CCA, including:
```
  o Actual Steam Export (ASEP) during the hour just prior to the initiation of

```
a CCA
```
  o Average Actual Steam Export (AASED) during the period of the CCA.

```

4) ISO will obtain the data for the Demonstrated Capability, Unadjusted

(DCU), and, for combined cycle Assets, adjust the DCU for the combined
steam and combustion turbine components to criterion temperature to
derive the Demonstrated Capability Adjusted for Temperature (DCAT); for
steam turbine Assets, DCAT is equal to DCU. ISO will then use steam
export information to normalize the output demonstrated for steam exports
to derive the Demonstrated Capability Adjusted for Temperature and
Steam Exports (DCATSE).

5) The following examples illustrate how DCATSE will be derived in different

situations:

_Example 1 - Assets with no interruptible steam sales (i.e., ISE = 0)_

In this example, the normalization process adjusts for the difference
between AASED and SCCSD as follows:

DCATSE = DCAT + (MW@SCCSD – MW@AASED)

Where:

MW@SCCSD = the expected output indicated by the steamtemperature-output table at the criterion temperature and SCCSD;
and

MW@AASED = the expected output indicated by the steamtemperature-output table at criterion temperature and the Actual
Average Steam Export during the period of the CCA.

_Example 2 - Assets for which steam sales are fully interruptible_

In this example, the steam exports are supposed to be interrupted during a
CCA or when the Asset is dispatched to its Eco Max in economic merit
order based on the Asset Supply Offers which should be consistent and
reflective of its contractual arrangements. Therefore, AASED should be


-----

equal to SCCSD. If steam exports are not interrupted, the CCA result will
reflect the failure to interrupt. In this example, there is no adjustment for
steam exports to be made:

DCATSE = DCAT

_Example 3 - Assets for which a fixed quantity of export steam is_
interruptible

In this example, the normalization process adjusts for the difference
between AASED and SCCSD (as in Example 1), but no credit is given for
failures to interrupt. In this example, the adjustment is as follows:

DCATSE = DCAT + MW@SCCSD – MW@AASED - [MW@SCCSD –
MW@(SCCSD + ISE – (ASEP – AASED)] = DCAT + [MW@(SCCSD +
ISE – (ASEP – AASED)] – MW@AASED

Where:

MW@SCCSD is defined as in Example 1;
MW@AASED is defined as in Example 1; and
MW@(SCCSD + ISE – (ASEP – AASED) = the expected output
indicated by the steam-temperature-output table at the criterion
temperature and a steam export reference point which is equal to
the SCCSD adjusted to reflect the difference between the claimed
ISE amount and the amount which was actually interrupted during
the CCA where such amount is equal to the difference between the
ASEP and the AASED.

The following examples in Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the steam export
adjustment calculations.

c. Gas Turbine, Combined Cycle, and Pseudo-Combined Cycle Assets with No

Steam Exports

1) Additional data that must be submitted to the ISO with the Asset

registration include a table reflecting the full range (100°F - 0°F, in one
degree increments) of temperature versus MW output for the Asset. Such
tables must be reflective of the Asset characteristics and claimed
capabilities reflected during initial registration and any subsequent revision
submittal.) Specifically:

   - The table may be referred to as the Assets temperature curve and

typically is non-linear by nature showing the degradation of output as
the ambient (or inlet) temperature increases. This curve should be an
accurate depiction of the Assets output at every ambient temperature
degree increment.

   - The output value associated with the 90°F temperature must equal the

initial summer SCC;

   - The output value associated with the 20°F temperature must equal the

initial winter SCC; and

    - All other MW output values must be consistent with those associated

with the 90°F and 20°F values.

3. Pumped Storage Hydro Assets

a. At the time of initial commercial operation for a station and/or Asset, a CCA

demonstration shall be conducted as a station.

b. Pumped storage stations that, due to a net head reduction, experience a

continuous downward trend in capability exceeding an average of one (1)
percent per hour during the first four (4) hours of the commercial operation or
subsequent station CCA demonstrations, should base the ratings on a station
demonstration rather than individual Asset’s demonstration. Asset CCA
demonstration requests to establish a higher Claimed Capability Rating shall
require a station CCA demonstration.

c. CCA demonstration requests to restore the capability of a single Asset, or a

subset of Assets at the station, may be performed individually as long as the
resulting capability of the station is less than or equal to the total SCC for the
station that had previously been claimed over the past two (2) similar
capability periods and no previous station demonstrations experienced a
downward trend in capability exceeding an average of one (1) percent per
hour.

d. SCC should be established that ensures that the total Energy content of the

upper reservoir is sufficient to sustain SCC for four (4) hours and that the
upper reservoir can be restored to provide the SCC for that duration during
five (5) successive weekdays.

e. Stations operated on a weekly draw-down cycle should determine SCC based

on a station upper reservoir Energy content being no greater at the completion
of the CCA than 75% of the maximum Energy content when the upper
reservoir is full.

4. Conventional Hydro Generators - Weekly

a. Stations may be considered as operated on a weekly draw-down cycle

provided there is on-site Energy storage between normal operating elevations
equivalent to at least ten (10) times SCC, assuming zero inflow from natural
run-off and upstream station water discharge. Otherwise, stations will be
considered as operated on a daily cycle.

b. Capability should be determined based on:

    - A station CCA demonstration (with all Assets within the station operating)

rather than individual Asset CCA demonstrations conducted at different
times.

c. SCC should be determined based on the stations normal or typical net head at

mid-week or mid-season.

### I. Definitions

The following definitions are used for the purposes of this Operating Procedure (OP):

**Degradation is any Protection System Component failure, or any other condition,**
that increases: (1) clearing times, (2) the exposure to longer clearing times, or (3)
the number of transmission or generation elements tripped from normal clearing.

**LCC Initial Protection Notification is a verbal notification issued by the Local**
Control Center (LCC) to ISO New England (ISO) regarding the potential
Degradation of a Protection System Component as further described in Section V.

**LCC Protection Outage Notification is a verbal notification issued by the LCC to**
ISO after the LCC receives an Owner Protection Outage Notification as described
in Section V.

**Owner Initial Protection Notification is a verbal notification that is issued by the**
owner of a Protection System Component when it confirms that there is a
Protection System Component failure leading to review as described in Section V.

**Owner Protection Outage Notification is a verbal notification that is issued by**
the owner of a Protection System Component once it makes the determination that
Degradation of the Protection System Component has occurred and cannot be
immediately corrected.

**Pilot Protection System is any communication-aided relay scheme (including**
direct transfer trip of remote ends).

**Protection System Component is any element that affects interrupting device**
tripping or relay input. Protection System Components include, but are not limited
to: sensing relays; tripping relays; lockout relays; DC supplies; control circuits from
sensing circuits through to the interrupting device trip coil; and communication
channels. Protection System Components do not include equipment such as fault
recorders and meters that do not directly affect protection operation.

Defined terms used but not defined in this OP shall have the meaning ascribed to
them in the ISO New England Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff or the
Glossary of Terms Used in North American Electric Reliability Corporation Inc.
(NERC) Reliability Standards or the Northeast Power Coordinating Council, Inc.
(NPCC) Glossary of Terms.


-----

### II. Purpose

This OP establishes requirements for entities that own transmission or generation
equipment to provide protective relay information to the ISO for the collaborative study
of Protection System Components and protection systems, including Remedial Action
Schemes (RAS) and Automatic Control Schemes (ACS) that protect transmission and
generation elements of the Bulk Electric System (BES). It also includes requirements
for equipment owners to coordinate protection equipment and relay settings. Lead
Market Participants (Lead MPs) for Generator Owners (GOs) shall provide protective
device characteristics to the ISO with the understanding that these settings are used
for the ISO’s reliability studies and system coordination.

This OP requires that, as appropriate, Transmission Owners (TOs), GOs, Generator
Operators (GOPs), and Lead MPs for GOs:

     - Collaborate or coordinate, as needed, regarding information necessary for

protection system characteristic reviews, and coordinate with other entities for
new protection systems, modifications to existing protection systems, or
changes in transmission system topology that necessitate changes in protection
systems. See Sections III and VI or further details regarding coordination and
protection characteristics.

     - For applicable facilities listed in Section IV, notify LCCs immediately after

confirming Protection System Component failure or Degradation as described in
Section V.A.

     - For applicable facilities listed in Section IV, provide information to the ISO

regarding planned Protection System Component outages for protection system
changes, testing or maintenance. Planned outage requests are described in
Section V.B.

     - Provide information to the ISO prior to making any changes to protection

characteristics for the protection of selected transmission or generation
equipment, except changes that do not significantly impact relay reach or
clearing times. This is detailed in Section VI.

     - Provide an annual certification that the protection system characteristics as

provided pursuant to this OP have been maintained throughout the year and
remain accurate.

The ISO uses the information provided pursuant to this OP to calculate system limits
such as operating and planning stability limits, determine generation dispatch limits, as
well as to further plan and operate the system in a reliable manner.


-----

### III. Coordination Between Entities for Protection Systems

In order to meet its responsibilities as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), Transmission
Operator (TOP), Planning Coordinator (PC), and Transmission Planner (TP), the
ISO’s role in determining protection system performance (including RAS and ACS
performance) focuses on the following areas:

     - Maintaining awareness of the operational status of protection systems, the

correct operation of which is relied upon to maintain system reliability

     - Obtaining the data needed to properly model the actions of protection systems

for system simulations

     - Reviewing the impacts of proposed new or modified protection systems on the

performance of the New England Transmission System

TOs, TOPs, GOs, and GOPs shall collaborate and, when necessary, coordinate the
design, construction, and commissioning of any new or modified protection system
with the owners and operators of all other affected facilities. TOs and GOs shall
comply with the requirements related to protection systems included in
interconnection agreements with other entities. In addition, TOs, TOPs, GOs, and
GOPs shall collaborate when changes in generation, transmission, load, or operating
conditions could require changes in the protection systems of others.

If protection changes are needed for interconnections with neighboring TOs, GOs,
and/or Balancing Authorities (BAs), the TO or GO shall coordinate protection system
settings as required with neighboring TOs, GOs, and BAs, including but not limited to,
New York and New Brunswick.

Outage coordination for Protection System Components is described in Section V.
TOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall:

     - notify ISO prior to making changes to protection systems as further described

in Section IV; and

     - provide the resulting characteristics of each changed protection system for ISO

approval as described in Section VI.

Figure 1a shows the planned Protection System/topology change, Protection System
Degradation and outage coordination flow diagram. The figure illustrates the
individual steps that are necessary when:

     - Applicable Protection System Component characteristics are modified

     - Protection System Components experience Degradation due to unplanned

circumstances

     - Planned Protection System Component outages occur

     - Topology changes are planned

### IV. Facilities Applicable for Notification of Failure or Degradation and Protection Outage Requests 

**A. Generation Facilities**

**NOTE**

For generators connected to transmission facilities 100 kV and above, it is
necessary to provide a notification of failure or Degradation of generator
protection, or when a protection outage impacts transmission as shown in Figure
2, since slow clearing could impact the transmission system. Even if a generator
is connected to transmission facilities above 100 kV, it is not necessary to request
outages for normal maintenance and testing work that could only result in tripping
a generator breaker that does not trip BES transmission facilities. Generator
interconnection voltage does not establish requirements for generators to provide
the characteristics described in Section VI.

This section describes the applicable facilities for, and conditions under which,
Lead MPs are required to request generator protection outages that are planned.
It also describes the applicable facilities for, and conditions under which, GOs or
GOPs are required to provide notifications of Protection System Component
failure or Degradation to the ISO. Section V describes how generator entities
shall provide notification of Protection System Component failure or Degradation
that impacts fault clearing on the BES, and how they shall request Protection
System Component outages. Section VI describes applicable facilities for which
generator protection characteristics shall be provided.

Protection maintenance and testing that would in any way degrade the level of
system protection or system reliability provided by the generator shall not occur
while the generator is on-line. GOs or GOPs shall verify that remaining protection
is adequate for the equipment if performing on-line maintenance or testing.

**1. Applicable generator facilities for notifications of generator Protection**

**System Component failure or Degradation**

Notification is required of any Protection System Component failure or
Degradation resulting in slower clearing times for protection that trips breakers
on the high or low side of the Generator step-up transformer (GSU) for
generators that interconnect to transmission facilities at 100 kV and above.
Notifications of Protection System Component failure or Degradation and the
subsequent request of a Protection System Component outage are described,
respectively, in Sections V.A and V.B. Notification is not required of Protection
System Component failure or Degradation for generators that are
interconnected below 100 kV.

2. **Applicable generator facility requests for Protection System Component**

**maintenance and testing outages**

Figure 2 illustrates that for generators connected at 100 kV and above,
protection outages that trip related BES transmission facilities shall be


-----

reported to the ISO. When Protection System Components that do not impact
BES transmission (i.e. the Protection System Components only trip the
generator breaker) are tested, it is not necessary for the Lead MP to submit an
outage request. Reports of Protection System Component outages are not
required for generators that interconnect at voltages below 100 kV.

Figure 2 - Outage Reporting for Generator Protection System Components

**B. Transmission Facilities**

**1. Applicable facilities for notifications of Protection System Component**

**failure or Degradation**

TOs shall investigate and immediately notify their respective LCC after
confirming any failures or Degradation of Protection System Components that
protect any facilities associated with transmission stations as noted in OP-24
Appendix C - Transmission Facilities Required to Report Protection
Characteristic, Failures or Degradation (OP-24C). Investigation and
notification are described in detail in Section V.A below.

2. **Applicable facilities for requesting Protection System Component**

**maintenance and testing outages**

OP-24C lists stations for which transmission Protection System Component
outages shall be requested. TOs shall submit a protection outage request for
any transmission facility connected to a transmission station listed in OP-24C.


-----

**C. RAS or ACS**

**For RAS:**
**NPCC Reliability Reference Directory #7 Remedial Action Schemes[1] has**
replaced the term Special Protection System (SPS) with Remedial Action Scheme
(RAS). The New England transmission system has a subset of Automatic Control
Schemes (ACS) and NPCC approved SPS in service that are now defined as RAS
using the following criteria from NPCC Directory #7:

**Type I: A RAS, other than a Limited Impact RAS, that recognizes or anticipates**
abnormal system conditions resulting from design or operating criteria contingencies.
**Type II: A RAS, other than a Limited Impact RAS, that recognizes or anticipates**
abnormal system conditions resulting from extreme contingencies or other extreme
causes.

**Limited Impact[2]: A RAS that cannot, by inadvertent operation or failure to operate,**
cause or contribute to BES or Bulk Power System (BPS) cascading, uncontrolled
action, angular instability, voltage instability, voltage collapse, or unacceptably
damped oscillations[3].

**For ACS:**
As per the ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-5[4] - Requirements And
**Guidelines For Application Of Remedial Action Schemes And Automatic**
**Control Schemes, an ACS is defined as any scheme that automatically changes**
system topology and is not classified as a RAS according to NERC and NPCC’s
definitions, with exceptions mentioned in the ISO New England Planning Procedure
No. 5-5.

TOs or Lead MPs for GOs shall:

     - Provide notification to their respective LCC of Protection System

Component failures or Degradation and request planned outages
associated with, or that affect the operation of a RAS or ACS as described
in Section V.

**D. Implementation for Notification of Failure or Degradation and Protection**

**Outage Requests**

1. For generators, Lead MPs shall submit outage requests and GOs and

GOPs shall provide failure or Degradation notifications as applicable under
Section IV.A.

1 [NPCC Reliability Reference Directory #7 Remedial Action Schemes](https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/program-areas/standards-and-criteria/regional-criteria/directories/directory-7-sect-3-clean-20210119.pdf)
2 This classification was formerly known as Type III.
3 Consistent with PRC-012 Supplemental Information, limited impact RAS is intended to act upon/mitigate
events   that are limited to a ""contained area"". (similar to ""local area"" within NPCC)
4 [ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-5](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp05_5/pp5_5.pdf)


-----

2. Outage requests and failure or Degradation notifications for transmission

Protection System Components are required for any element connected at
100 kV and above for a facility listed in OP-24C.

3. If a transmission facility is added to or removed from OP-24C, then the TO

for such facility shall provide outage, failure or Degradation notifications in
compliance with this OP on or before 180 calendar days from the effective
date of the updated and published OP-24C.


-----

### V. Protection System Component Failure Degradation and Outage Coordination

**NOTE**

TOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall notify ISO prior to making relay settings
changes in accordance with Section VI.

This section describes the requirements for notification of Protection System
Component failure or Degradation, as well as the requirements for reporting of
Protection System Component outages. For a transmission facility with Protection
System Components that has multiple owners within New England, protection
outage failure or Degradation information shall be reviewed by the protection staff of
the entities operating any/all terminal(s) of the jointly operated facility in order to
coordinate the Protection System Component outage request.

**A. Notification of Generation and Transmission Protection System**

**Component Failure or Degradation:**

If Protection System Component failure or Degradation occurs, then it shall be
reported as shown in Figure 2. For a generator connected at 100 kV or above or
as listed in OP-24C for a transmission facility, the notification process involves
several steps by the following entities:
```
      o the entities that own the Protection System Components (i.e. TOs and

```
GOs)
```
      o LCCs
      o the ISO

```
**NOTE**

The Owner Initial Protection Notification is intended to provide the LCC and the
ISO with lead time to develop a plan in case of failure or Degradation that cannot
be immediately repaired, coincident with the TO, GO, or GOP determination of
parts availability and repair capability.

In order to provide enough time for operator action, while avoiding false
indications of system issues, notifications shall be made as follows:

1. An Owner Initial Protection Notification shall be made to the LCC:
```
      o by a TO immediately after confirming a failure or potential Degradation of

```
an applicable Protection System Component as specified in OP-24C (this
Owner Initial Protection Notification shall be based on verification of the
actual Protection System Component status);
```
      o by a GO or GOP immediately after confirming a failure or potential

```
Degradation of a Protection System Component that affects facilities for
generators connected at 100 kV and above.


-----

2. If the Protection System Component failure or potential Degradation is

confirmed by the TO, GO, or GOP, then the LCC shall issue an LCC Initial
Protection Notification to ISO regarding the failure or potential Degradation.

3. When the investigation by the TO, GO or GOP concludes that there is a

Degradation of the Protection System Component that cannot be immediately
repaired, the TO, GO, or GOP shall issue an Owner Protection Outage
Notification to the LCC which, in turn, shall issue an LCC Protection Outage
Notification to ISO.

4. Following the LCC Protection Outage Notification regarding the failure or

Degradation, the TO, or MP who owns or represents the Protection System
Component shall complete an outage request for the Protection System
Component as described in Subsection B below.

**B. Outage Requests for Generation and Transmission Protection System**

**Component Equipment**

Protection System Component outage requests shall be submitted when
failure or Degradation occurs or in advance of Protection System Component
outages related to capital improvements, testing, and maintenance which
may also be used to deploy setting changes upon completion of the related
ISO review process as described in Section VI. TOs and Lead MPs for GOs
shall submit planned Protection System Component outage requests to LCCs
and ISO in accordance with the time requirements listed in Table 1 below and
in accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3
Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3). Entities are encouraged to submit
Protection System Component outage requests earlier than the Table 1
deadlines, when possible, to reduce the risk of ISO rejection of outage
requests, if additional time is needed for collecting information and performing
analysis.

ISO outage approvals may allow the removal of Protection System Components
from service, when equipment is energized, if the TO or Lead MP for GO
(consistent with ownership) determines that adequate redundant or backup
protection is provided. The ISO shall evaluate the loss of any remaining
Protection System Component functionality and document the operating
action(s) to be taken if remaining Protection System Component functionality is
lost.

TOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall provide additional information regarding
clearing times or additional elements tripped by completing Appendix D to this
OP - Required Protection Outage Request Form and Examples (OP-24D).

**C. Protection System Component Outages of a Duration Greater than 30**

**Calendar Days**

TOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall avoid Protection System Component outages
that last longer than 30 calendar days. If a Protection System Component that is
involved in the protection of equipment listed in OP-24C is out-of-service for
longer than 30 calendar days, then the TOP with information from the TO or
Lead MP for the GO shall provide:
```
   o an attachment to the outage request showing progress in restoring the

```
Protection System Component to service; and
```
   o a corrective action plan describing the steps that will be undertaken to

```
restore the Protection System Component to service.

The ISO reserves the right to disconnect from the system, any transmission or
generation element that has unacceptable protection performance, which could
result in adverse impact on system reliability. The ISO may invoke this right for
an outage lasting less than 30 calendar days.


-----

### VI. Relay Characteristics Provided to ISO

**A. Modifying Relay Settings for Emergencies**

When necessary to ensure the reliability of the power system (for example, by
reducing the risk of a misoperation), a TO or GO may make relay settings
modifications before notifying ISO. Specifically, in such an emergency, a TO or
GO may provide the notifications described in Section V within seven (7)
Business Days after the date of the emergency, and the notifications shall also
include a description of the emergency.

**B. Protection System Components for Generating Facilities**

1. **Applicable Facilities**

Lead MPs for GOs shall perform periodic reviews of relay characteristics for
generation facilities with a single point of interconnection over 100 kV with
gross plant/facility aggregate nameplate rating greater than or equal to 75
MVA and at any other facility where the ISO has indicated in writing to the
Lead MP for the GO, that the characteristics are needed for reliability studies.

2. **Data Transmittals, Creation of Models, and Protection Updates for**

**Generation Facilities**

Lead MPs for GOs with new or modified generation facilities that meet the
applicability as described in section VI.B.1 shall provide the required data,
using the Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS),[5] at least 90 calendar
days prior to Commercial operation along with as-built settings prior to
Commercial operation. In addition, the Lead MP for the GO shall promptly
and fully respond to any additional data requests and any questions from the
ISO regarding the relay setting characteristics.

If, subsequent to the development and certification of the initial PSS/E
generator relay models, any relay setting characteristics for a generation
facility changes, then the Lead MP for the GO shall develop updated PSS/E
generator relay models itself. Appendix A[6] to this OP - Generator Relay
Settings (OP-24A) provides guidance that Lead MPs for GOs may use when
creating relay models for PSS/E from actual relay settings. Additional
information can be found in the document named “Generator Protection
Modeling Practice & Guidelines” posted on the ISO’s external website at:

[http://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc](http://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc)

5 DDMS can be accessed at https://smd.iso-ne.com/
6 Appendix A is based on the NERC document: Considerations for Power Plant and Transmission System
Protection Coordination, Technical Reference Document – Revision 2, System Protection and Control
Subcommittee, July 2015.


-----

**NOTE**

Lead MPs for GOs do not need to inform ISO of changes to protective relays
not listed in OP-24 Appendix A. Those changes shall be coordinated in
accordance with NERC Standard PRC-027.

Using DDMS, the Lead MP for the GO shall submit, to the ISO, updates to
relay settings characteristics and information, including revised PSS/E
generator relay models, at least 120 calendar days in advance of making
permanent changes to the relay characteristics specified in OP-24A. This will
provide ISO time to review the effect of protection changes on system stability
performance.

3. **Certification and Recertification of Generator Relay Models**

Lead MPs for GOs shall certify in DDMS that the generator relay models
developed pursuant to Section VI.B.2 are accurate, per the timeline
established in Section VI.B.2.

Lead MPs for GOs shall recertify, on an annual basis, that generator relay
models are accurate. The recertification shall be performed in DDMS as part
of the certification of other generator dynamics and other data required
pursuant to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical
Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related
Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14).

4. **Standard Models and Generator Breaker Tripping Information**

OP-24A includes commonly used PSS/E standard models for relay functions.
A Lead MP for the GO may select a different standard PSS/E library model if
more appropriate. Provision of user-written models for relays is not
acceptable.

5. **Clearing Time Information for GO Owned Substations and Transmission**

Lead MPs for GOs with transmission equipment connected at 100 kV and
above (i.e. lines, generator step-up transformers and associated equipment)
and generator breakers on the low side of the GSU shall be provided in
accordance with Section VI.C and VI.E.

**C. Transmission Equipment Data Submittals**

1. Transmission Owners that are also Transmission Planners (TO-TPs) shall

provide protection characteristics as described below, to the ISO System
Protection Working Group (SPWG) ShareFile folder.

2. Generator Owners (GOs) shall provide protection information associated with

transmission equipment in the manner specified in the ISO data request.


-----

3. Other Protection Asset Owners shall provide protection information in the

manner specified in the ISO data request.

**D. Transient Swing Detection Characteristics for Transmission Lines:**

1. **Model Submittal Requirements**

a. Certain ISO-conducted planning studies use a generic distance relay

model to monitor for the possible tripping of non-faulted elements due to
stable power swings. The generic relay model used is as follows:

(1) Reach equal to 300% of the impedance of the monitored line with
all lines in-service and no intentional tripping time delay

(2) In any instances where this generic model shows that a line is
susceptible to tripping without a fault during power swings, the
ISO shall require that the appropriate TO(s) provide relay models
for any relays that could trip a terminal of the line without
requiring a permissive signal from the opposite terminal(s) of the
line.

b. For multi-terminal lines, the generic relay model used by the ISO shall

have a reach equal to 300% of the total impedance to the furthest terminal
of the line, without considering infeed current from other terminals.

**NOTE**

The exclusion described in Section VI.D.1.c. addresses the fact that a permissive
relay scheme (such as a Permissive over-reaching transfer trip (POTT) scheme)
will not trip unless the apparent impedance at both terminals of the transmission
line enters the fault characteristic zone. This can only happen if a point along the
transmission line has a voltage equal to zero - meaning that either the line is
faulted or the swing is not stable (the two terminals of the line are out-of-step with
each other). A directional comparison blocking scheme can act if only one
terminal’s apparent impedance enters the fault characteristic zone.

c. TOs shall provide relay models to the ISO for any relays with a reach that

exceeds 300% of the total impedance of the line, and that operate with an
intentional delay less than or equal to 60 cycles. This data shall be
required only for relays that could trip one or more terminals of the line
without requiring a permissive signal from the opposite terminal(s) of the
line. For example, data for step-distance or directional comparison
blocking schemes reaching beyond 300% of the total impedance of the
line is required; but data for POTT schemes is not required, because
these schemes would not act without a permissive signal from the
opposite terminal.

d. TOs shall provide all required relay reach modeling information in a DYR

file format, usable in the PSS/E software package. Models shall be
submitted using the SPWG ShareFile folder within 15 Business Days of
an ISO request, or at least 120 days prior to a change resulting in relay


-----

reach beyond 300% of line impedance. Changes may require approval
pursuant to the timing and other requirements of Section I.3.9 of the ISO
Tariff before implementation.

2. **Implementation**

TOs shall provide actual models for lines that are susceptible to tripping
during transient swings as outlined in Sections VI.D.1.c and VI.D.1.d. When
making any settings changes in accordance with Section VI.D.1.d, TOs shall
provide the information in accordance with that Section.

TOs shall provide relay models for relays that reach beyond 300% of the line
impedance, as described in VI.D.1.c.

**E. Fault Clearing Information for Lines, Transformers and Shunt Devices:**

**1. Equipment For Which Fault Clearing Data Is Required**

The ISO uses fault-clearing information to simulate clearing of criteria
required faults in assessing the acceptable performance of the power system.
TOs and, as determined under Section VI.B.5, Lead MPs for GOs
(collectively, Protection Asset Owners) shall provide the fault clearing
information as specified in Appendix B to this OP - Transmission Relaying
Characteristics (OP-24B) for all equipment with at least one terminal
connected to 100 kV and above, as well as for all PTF facilities at 69 kV.
Protection Asset Owners shall coordinate responses for a line that connects
substations with different owners.

**2. Implementation**

a. As applicable, Protection Asset Owners shall provide fault-clearing

information for all equipment with at least one terminal connected at 100
kV and above, as well as for all PTF facilities at 69 kV within 180 calendar
days of the original request.

b. The ISO may request protection system data for a limited set of specific

transmission or generation elements that is not already provided pursuant
to OP-24B. Protection Asset Owners shall respond to such requests by
providing fault clearing information according to the following timelines:

(1) if needed for planning purposes, within 20 Business Days of receiving
a request from the ISO; or

(2) if needed for operations purposes, within 2 Business Days of receiving
a request from the ISO.

c. The ISO shall initiate an annual certification that the clearing times

provided by Protection Asset Owners are accurate. Each Protection
Asset Owner shall certify that the clearing times on file with the ISO are
currently valid and correct.


-----

**3. Data Required and Submission Process**

**NOTE**

Protection Asset Owners shall provide a “proxy” clearing time representing the
most conservative clearing time by ground overcurrent relays. TOs shall provide
the exact ground overcurrent relay model for a given transmission element if the
ISO determines that the simulation fails using the “proxy” clearing time.

Protection Asset Owners shall provide the overcurrent relay model in a format
acceptable to the ISO (relay settings data is not acceptable).

a. The format for protection system data submittal is included in OP-24B.

OP-24B requires default clearing time information for transmission lines,
transformers, substation equipment, and breakers. When the equipment
does not clear within the default clearing time, it is necessary to provide
additional information on the protection characteristics in OP-24B. As part
of this process, any data on step-distance on transmission lines shall be
submitted if these schemes are the fastest protection schemes in one of
the two redundant systems. Completed versions of OP-24B, shall be
submitted as specified in section VI.C.

b. Any change to the existing protection at substations that are listed in

OP-24C that affects clearing times or relay reaches, except for those
where both the pre- and post- change clearing times are less than or
equal to (<) the applicable default clearing time, or any new protection
subject to OP-24B (e.g. due to topology changes), shall be submitted to
ISO at least 60 calendar days in advance of energization. This time
requirement does not apply to emergency conditions as described in
Section VI.A, or temporary changes of less than one year, for
construction or replacements. This requirement also does not apply to
all other elements in OP-24B that are not at the substations listed in
OP-24C, and any changes to protection systems to these facilities shall
be reported as a part of the annual recertification. These changes may
require approval pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff if applicable.
All changes and updates shall be submitted as specified in section
VI.C.

c. In addition to the information described above, certain ISO planning

studies consider contingencies with delayed fault-clearing due to the
failure of a non-redundant protection package to protect the faulted
element as designed, such as for one of the following:

(1) Generator

(2) Transmission circuit

(3) Transformer

(4) Shunt device

(5) Bus section


-----

For these studies, the ISO shall request additional information and the TO
shall provide the data in accordance with the description contained in the
request. This information shall be provided within 20 Business Days of
receiving the request from the ISO.


-----

### VII. Specific Relay Settings Information

**A. Protection System Components for Generating Facilities**

OP-14 includes additional specifications for generator protection settings.

**B. Transmission Automatic Reclosing Requirements**

TOs shall provide the time delay for automatic line reclosing pursuant to OP-24B.
Automatic line reclosing, if set properly, expedites the return-to-service of a line
following a temporary fault. However, reclosing may cause system and generator
instability, generator or transmission equipment fatigue and failure, as well as
other issues that could have an adverse impact on reliability. In order to balance
the varied needs of the New England Transmission System, the ISO shall review
the data, submitted by the TOs, on the time delay for automatic line reclosing.
The ISO shall apply the following principles in its review:

1. High-speed automatic reclosing [referred to as high-speed reclosing in NERC

Reliability Standards and High-Speed Auto reclosing in the NPCC Glossary of
Terms], is automatic reclosing that occurs in less than one second, and is not
permitted for use on the New England Transmission System. The ISO will not
support the installation and use of high-speed automatic reclosing in New
England. The ISO shall be promptly notified about any existing high-speed
automatic reclosing. The ISO may order that any existing high-speed
automatic reclosing be taken out-of-service until technical analysis can confirm
that it does not cause an adverse impact to system reliability. The ISO shall
evaluate automatic reclosing occurring at one second for acceptance on a
case-by-case basis; the ISO may order that any existing one second automatic
reclosing be taken out-of-service until the technical analysis can confirm that it
does not cause an adverse impact to system reliability.

2. Automatic reclosing slower than 1 second but faster than:
```
        o 5 seconds for 230 kV, 138 kV, and 115 kV facilities; or
        o 15 seconds for 345 kV facilities;

```
shall be reviewed by the ISO with a potential recommendation to reset the
reclosing time delay if the ISO finds an adverse impact on system reliability.

3. Automatic reclosing equal to or slower than
```
        o 5 seconds for 230 kV, 138 kV and 115 kV facilities; or
        o 15 seconds for 345 kV facilities;

```
shall typically not require ISO review.

The above time delays refer to any interval between consecutive attempts to
automatically reclose.

These settings fall within the typical reclosing assumptions used in ISO’s past
planning and operating studies and, as such, have raised no reliability


-----

concerns. However, if the ISO finds an adverse impact on system reliability,
then the ISO may recommend that the reclosing time delay be reset.

**I.** **PURPOSE**

Information about the power system responses during system disturbances is
collected by transmission station equipment called Dynamic Disturbance Recorders
(DDRs) or Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). This information is necessary for
disturbance analysis, and to compare in simulations using the planning dynamic
model to actual system response as required for North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard MOD-033 - Steady-State and Dynamic
System Model Validation (MOD-033).

     - This OP-22 establishes:

           - the Transmission Owner (TO) requirement to install a DDR or

PMU at the specific existing and new transmission stations that
are identified by ISO New England Inc. (ISO), and

           - the DDR and PMU standards to ensure that Market Participant

(MP) installed equipment provides the necessary information
about power system response.

     - This OP-22 describes the process to establish DDR and PMU requirements,

and to share DDR and PMU data.

     - This OP-22 specifies the maintenance procedures and schedules that each

TO shall follow to ensure the required functionality and performance is
realized.

**II.** **DDR IMPLEMENTATION**

MPs shall have in-service, or be progressing towards having in-service, all the DDR
equipment necessary to meet the OP-22 requirements and NERC Reliability
Standard PRC-002 – Disturbance Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (PRC002) requirements.

**III.** **PROCESS FOR DETERMINING, DOCUMENTING AND REPORTING DDR**
**REQUIREMENTS**

ISO shall determine and provide DDR location requirements to the DDR/PMU
Working Group. The DDR/PMU Working Group shall meet as required to review

-----

**V.** **COMPLIANCE**

Periodically, NPCC may conduct an audit survey of metering, recording devices and
telemetering criteria to determine the degree of MP compliance with all NERC
Reliability Standard Requirements.

The Chair of the DDR/PMU Working Group shall review the program annually to
verify ongoing compliance with the NERC Reliability Standard Requirements.

**VI.** **PMU REQUIREMENTS**

A PMU provides data that is used in analyzing power system response. This section
provides the requirements for PMUs as established by the DDR/PMU Working
Group. A stand-alone PMU is not subject to the PRC-002 requirements for a DDR
unless it is also used as a DDR. Each PMU shall meet the following requirements:

1. Each PMU shall provide a stream of synchrophasors for each required

current and voltage in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 format. The data stream
channel names shall adhere to the submitted and approved Registry form. A
template for the Registry form is provided in Appendix C. All synchrophasor
data shall be reported in Coordinated Universal Time (“UTC time”) with zero
offset.

2. The timing device providing the clock signal shall be accurate to at least one

microsecond. Equipment shall also support correct leap second insertion.
The timing signal shall be of sufficient strength for each PMU device.

3. The PMU shall develop and transmit a synchrophasor at least once every

one-thirtieth of a second with the capability of increasing the rate to once
every one-sixtieth of a second.

4. Synchrophasors shall be derived from all three phases or from a single phase

measurement:

a. If three phase measurements are used, only one synchrophasor shall be

provided (i.e., the positive sequence synchrophasor).

b. If single phase measurements are used, the voltage synchrophasor shall

be derived from the same phase as the current synchrophasor, and both
shall originate from phase B if possible.

c. For the ISO calculated MW and MVAR derived from the voltage and

current signals, the TO must follow the polarity convention designated in
OP-18 Appendix D, Figure 1.

5. Voltage synchrophasors for each station bus shall be provided from each

specified voltage level or if measurements are based on equipment
connected to only one bus, then two or more independent voltage
synchrophasors shall be provided. If an independent source voltage is not
available, then line voltage measurements are acceptable. Bus voltage
measurements are preferred but multiple line voltage measurements are
acceptable if bus measurements are not readily available.

6. Voltage and current measurements shall be provided on all specified facilities

per Appendix B as indicated in the column “Monitored Electrical Quantities”

7. PMUs shall be powered by the station DC supply.

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**


-----

8. PMUs shall stream data continuously to ISO through a SCADA Center or

LCC Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC). Compliance for PMU data streaming
remains the responsibility of the PMU owner.

9. Each PDC shall have at least thirty (30) days of local storage capability.

10. The PMU shall continuously stream all current (I) and voltage (V) channel

data to ISO throughout power system events. If a PMU or an associated PDC
does not continuously stream during a power system event, then the TO
responsible for the PMU and PDC shall respond to an ISO request for
information by providing:

a. All available disturbance monitoring equipment information and records

within ten (10) Business Days. Under special circumstances (e.g. storm
restoration) the ten Business Day response may be extended by
agreement between ISO-NE and the responsible TO.

b. A detailed description of why the PMU or PDC failed, within sixty (60)

calendar days.

c. A Corrective Action Plan provided within ninety (90) calendar days of the

ISO request for information.

11. If PMU communications are lost during an event, the ISO shall notify the TO

when continuous streaming is discontinued during a power system event, so
that troubleshooting can be facilitated by the TO. ISO shall notify the TO that
the continuous streaming was lost, within ten (10) Business Days or less
when data is required for ISO event analysis.

12. For PMU installations only, average Latency shall be equal to or less than 0.5

seconds. Maximum Latency shall be equal to or less than 1.5 seconds.
Latency is defined as arrival time at the ISO PDC minus the PMU time stamp.

**VII.** **PMU INSTALLATIONS FOR EXISTING FACILITIES**

If existing monitoring equipment in a Pool Transmission Facility (PTF) transmission
station is not capable of providing power system response information, PMU
installations shall be required.

1. All PTF transmission stations listed in Appendix B shall include a PMU

installation.

2. PMUs shall develop the synchrophasors for all transmission elements at

identified voltage levels at stations as listed in Appendix B.

3. PMUs shall monitor all station elements associated with STATCOMs,

Synchronous Condensers, SVCs and load where specified.

4. PMUs shall be installed in accordance with the dates listed in Appendix B.

**VIII.** **PMU ADDITIONS WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION OR MODIFICATIONS**

PMUs at PTF transmission stations provide needed information on system
performance for modeling calibration, transfer and operating limit validation and
optimization, and post-event re-creation, all of which are needed to reliably operate
the transmission system. Any PMUs required by the below criteria will monitor the
PTF transmission station and all line and transformer terminals. For purposes of this

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**


-----

section, the term generation means any resource connected to the PTF, non-PTF
transmission or distribution systems (including any subsystem thereof or behind a
customer meter) that is capable of providing energy injection or energy withdrawal
(this includes, but is not limited to, inverter-based generation, electric storage
resources, and distributed generation).

Transmission Owners shall install PMUs based on the following criteria:

1. All new 345 kV PTF stations and any other PTF locations as specified by ISO

shall include a PMU installation. ISO shall specify new locations for PMU
installations for system observability. Such locations include, but are not
limited to, PTF transmission stations that connect significant load,
transmission, HVDC or generation to the transmission system. PMUs for new
345 kV PTF stations shall be in-service when the new station goes into
service. PMU in-service dates for ISO identified PTF stations will be agreed
upon by ISO and the Transmission Owner.

2. When new elements are added to a station with an existing PMU, PMU

monitoring shall be added and made active for the new elements on the PTF
side prior to energization. Each new element requiring PMU channels shall
include lines (AC and AC side of DC), transformers (high and low side for
PTF transformers) and dynamic reactive devices.

3. At new or existing TO PTF stations that are at a voltage of 100 kV or greater

where new generation or new dynamic reactive devices (such as
synchronous condensers, statcoms or SVCs) interconnect directly to the
transmission system. PMUs monitoring new generation additions and
dynamic VAR devices should be monitoring and in-service when the
generation begins performing non-commercial testing with initial sync.

4. At new Transmission Owner PTF stations with planned generation totaling at

least 20 MVA or 20 MW nameplate, including distribution connected
generation. For new PTF stations built for generator interconnection, PMUs
monitoring the new generation interconnection shall be monitoring and inservice when the generation begins performing non-commercial testing.

5. For existing PTF stations that will connect at least 20 MVA or 20 MW

nameplate of generation as described in this Section VIII of this OP-22, the
PMUs monitoring new generation additions shall be monitoring and in-service
when aggregated generation of at least 20 MVA or 20 MW nameplate begins
performing non-commercial testing If commencing monitoring at the time the
generation begins performing non-commercial testing is not possible, then the
TO shall coordinate with ISO to determine the schedule for PMU installation.

This threshold is met when the next generator preceding commercial status
will cause the sum of the DER to equal or exceed 20 MVA or 20 MW.

6. For existing PTF stations that already connect at least 20 MVA or 20 MW

nameplate of generation as described herein, the TO shall coordinate with
ISO to determine the schedule for PMU installation. The TO shall determine
when stations meet these criterion. For existing stations the TO shall
identify the stations that meet this criteria by December 1, 2023. TOs shall

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**


-----

coordinate with ISO to develop a PMU installation plan using this list by
February 1, 2024.

7. For stations that are non-PTF that connect 20 MVA or 20 MW of generation

as described herein, PMUs shall be installed at the nearest PTF stations to
capture these non-PTF station flows.

8. Distribution entity Market Participants that do not own the stations supplying

them shall annually provide amounts of DER and synchronous generation
installed within their service territory by station to their interconnecting
Transmission Owner(s)

The ISO shall include each identified station under these criteria in Appendix B to
this OP prior to the PMU being required to be in service.

**IX.** **SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS**

A TO shall notify ISO of any station where PMU installation would necessitate
significant modifications, such as, but not limited, to:

1. New cable tray or cable trench installation

2. Extensive rerouting of existing cables or other facilities

3. Additions or modifications to building structure

When notified of significant modifications per this requirement, ISO shall consider
other stations for PMU installations, review those considerations with the respective
TO and revise Appendix B, as needed.

**X.** **TESTING, VERIFICATION, MAINTENANCE AND OUTAGE REPORTING**

**A. Overall Requirements**

Each TO shall properly maintain its DDR and PMU equipment in accordance with
applicable ANSI/IEEE and NERC Reliability Standards, as amended from time-totime. The specific standards for testing, verification and maintenance are put forth in
this Section X.

**B. DDR/PMU Overall System Testing**

To ensure the accuracy of DDR or PMU data, each TO shall perform the
following tests using manual or computerized routines as specified below:

1. Initial Reasonability Tests (New or Modified Installation Prior to Streaming

Data

During commissioning or reconfiguring of PMUs, under steady-state
conditions, i.e., without system events, for a period of ten (10) seconds, all
timestamps must be correct up to one millisecond, and there must be no bad
Status Flags, no out-of-normal range values, and no flat-lined values.
Voltage angle must not have repeated consecutive values when the system
frequency is not exactly at nominal (60 Hz). Frequency calculated from a
voltage angle shall be consistent with that reported by the same PMU. Any
necessary reconfiguring that is found as a result of reasonability testing shall
be performed within fifteen (15) days.

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**


-----

2. Bench Testing

Bench Testing shall be performed with normal field inputs to PMUs removed.
The TO associated with the PMU shall install equipment to provide measured
test signals for voltage and current input into the PMU in order to provide a
known scaled reference output throughout the operating range.

The TO shall calibrate or test the accuracy of systems according to
manufacturer’s procedures and with bench testing, at least every twelve (12)
years or at ISO request due to suspected PMU data quality issues. In
addition, when ISO requests PMU bench testing due to irregular PMU data
quality, the TO associated with the PMU shall perform the bench testing
within thirty (30) days and correct any issue found within sixty (60) days of the
notification of the suspected data quality issues.

Errors should not exceed an error of +/- 0.25 % of full scale. If during the
test, errors exceed this value, the device shall be recalibrated, repaired or
replaced as necessary within ninety (90) days to attain that accuracy.

**C. Record Keeping and Auditing**

Each TO shall maintain records of the testing and verification of all DDR and
PMU equipment that is required to be installed in accordance with the provisions
of this OP-22. The records shall include:

   - Entity name

    - Element (line, bus, transformer, etc.) name covered by telemetry

   - Name of telemetering device (or system)

    - The dates of testing or verification

    - % error of as-found (and as-left if recalibrated or replaced)

    - A note, if as-found is not within accuracy tolerance

    - Action(s) taken (if applicable) including date(s) of action(s)

These records shall be retained for a minimum of the two (2) most current testing
(or verification) cycles or since the last audit (whichever is greater) and shall be
available to ISO and the LCC upon request.

**D. PDC Software Updates**

To obtain reliable data, the PDC shall use a reliable version of software or
firmware in agreement with ISO. Prior to installation, any new software updates
shall be assessed by the TO and tested prior to production use to ensure
software has been verified for the upgrade.

**E. Clock Out-of-Synch**

If the time source is out-of-service or out of synchronization, then a Real-Time
notification to TO personnel shall indicate clock out-of-synch.

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**

**F. Testing and Outage Notifications**

Maintenance testing and outage requests shall be in accordance with ISO
Operating Procedure OP-2 Maintenance of Communications, Computers,
Metering, and Computer Support Equipment.

1. Planned Testing

Prior to performing DDR, PDC or PMU testing, or testing of input signals (i.e.
CT or VT inputs), the TO shall either take the DDR, PDC or PMU out-ofservice or stop output from the tested device to prevent erroneous signals
from being sent.

2. Planned Outage Notifications

Planned DDR, PDC or PMU maintenance outage notifications shall be made
to the ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies. Outage requests shall be made at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the outage.

3. DDR, PDC or PMU Out-of-Service Notification

When a DDR listed in Appendix A or PMU listed in Appendix B receives an
“Out of Service” alarm, the TO associated with the DDR or PMU shall, within
two (2) Business Days of the initial discovery, either resolve the issue or notify
the ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies via email, of the outage.

When a TO associated with the PDC receives an “Out of Service” alarm, the
TO shall notify the ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies.

4. Clock Out-of-Synch or Service Notification

When a Clock associated with a DDR or PMU receives an “Out of Sync” or
“Out of Service” alarm, the TO associated with the Clock shall, within two (2)
Business Days of the initial discovery, either resolve the issue or notify the
ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies with a time estimate of when the Clock will
be returned to service.

**G. Restoration of PDC Equipment to Service**

The PDC shall be restored to service within five (5) Business Days. Under
special circumstances (e.g. storm restoration or failure of primary and back-up
systems), the five Business Day response may be extended by agreement
between ISO-NE and the responsible TO.

**H. Restoration of DDR, and PMU Equipment to Service**

The TO associated with a DDR or PMU shall make all reasonable efforts to
restore equipment to service that is forced out-of-service or if the quality of data
is inadequate. Restoration should be within 90 days. If an outage lasts longer
than fifteen days, then the TO associated with the DDR or PMU shall provide a
monthly update regarding equipment status to the ISO Manager, Real-Time
Studies. The update shall include the reason for the extended outage; a repair
progress update; purchase order numbers for parts and technical services; hours
that have been expended on equipment repair; and, updates to the corrective
action plan.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

A. This ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing

(OP-23), describes the methods by which ISO verifies certain resource
capabilities including:

     - ten and thirty minute off-line reserve capability

     - Seasonal Claimed Capability (SCC)

     - reactive capability

B. Based upon the audit results, ISO may limit the value of the parameter that can

be submitted in the Supply Offer of the resource.


-----

**II.** **RESERVE AUDITING**

**A. FAST** **STARTA.** **RESERVE** **AUDITING**

**1. Economic Dispatch Fast Start Reserve Audit**

a. When a Fast Start Generator or Fast Start Demand Response Resource

receives an electronic dispatch signal to start (including a Market
Participant-requested fast start off-line reserve audit):

(1) The resource shall respond to the dispatch signal in accordance with

its Supply Offer.

(2) ISO shall evaluate the resource response to the dispatch signal in

accordance with Section III of the ISO New England, Inc.
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (Tariff), (Market Rule 1 Standard Market Design).

(3) Response to these dispatch signals is used to adjust the CLAIM10 or

CLAIM30 value for each resource as described in Section III.9.5 of
the Tariff - Forward Reserve Resources.

**2. Market Participant-Requested Fast Start Reserve Audit**

a. For Generator Assets:

(1) The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) or Designated Entity (DE)

may request that the fast start off-line reserve capability of a
Generator Asset be audited by submitting a request through the
Claimed Capability Auditing Tool (CCAT) software.

i. Each Lead MP or DE-requested fast start off-line reserve audit

shall be performed in accordance with Section III.9.5 of the
Tariff.

(2) In order to modify or rescind a request to perform a fast start off-line

reserve audit the following shall be performed:

i. DE: Inform the ISO control room of the request for

modification or cancellation.

ii. Lead MP/DE: Modify or cancel the audit request using the

CCAT software.

b. For Demand Response Resources (DRRs):

(1) The Lead MP may request that the fast start reserve capability of a

DRR be audited by submitting a request through the Demand
Response Audit and Testing Tool (DRATT) software.

(2) In order to modify or rescind a request to perform a fast start reserve

audit the following shall be performed:


-----

i. Demand DE: Inform the ISO control room of the request for

modification or cancellation.

ii. Lead MP/Demand DE: Modify or cancel the audit request

using the DRATT software.

**3. Reporting**

a. ISO shall provide reports to the Lead MP of a fast start resource as follows:

(1) Within two Business Days of the resource receiving a start-up

Dispatch Instruction, a report shall be provided stating:

i. time and date of the dispatch

ii. target value for the dispatch

iii. output or reduction at 10 and 30 minutes following the initial

Dispatch Instruction

iv. whether the resource was in-service and available for 60

minutes following the initial Dispatch Instruction.

(2) Each week, prior to 1700 on Thursday, a report shall be provided

stating the resource:

i. current CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 performance factors for the

following week

ii. CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 for the following week

iii. maximum output at 10 and 30 minutes for the previous

Forward Reserve Procurement Period.

**4. Disputing Audit Results**

a. A Lead MP may dispute the audit results obtained from a start-up Dispatch

Instruction by entering an issue in the ISO Participant Support issue
tracking system prior to noon of the third Business Day after the day on
which the results were provided. The notification shall include any
Operating Data that is not consistent with the data used by ISO to
determine the results.

b. While the dispute is under assessment:

(1) Until the dispute has been resolved, the CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 shall

be adjusted using the ISO-derived value in accordance with Section
III of the Tariff.

(2) ISO shall consider the data provided by the Lead MP and make good
faith efforts to resolve the data differences.

(3) With respect to disputes, ISO shall make the final determination and

inform the Lead MP of the determination.


-----

i. Any changes to a CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 resulting from the

ISO’s final determination with respect to a dispute is
applicable on a prospective basis.

**5. CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 Cure**

a. Section III.9.5.3.4 of the Tariff - Performance Factor Cure permits the Lead

MP, Demand DE, or DE to submit a restoration plan to ISO in order to
restore a resource’s CLAIM10 or CLAIM30.

(1) ISO shall evaluate the restoration plan in accordance with Section III

of the Tariff.

(2) Following completion of the restoration plan, the resource shall

perform the Market Participant-requested audit using Section II.A.2. of
this Operating Procedure and the CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 shall be
adjusted in accordance with Section III.9.5.3.4 of the Tariff.

**6. Initial CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 Values**

a. For a resource that is newly-determined ready to respond to ISO dispatch

by ISO or will be changing its registration from not being fast start capable
to being fast start capable, the CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 are set to zero until
the first electronic start-up following the status change.

**B. RESPONSEB.** **RATE** **AUDITING**

1. Because response rates affect both Real-Time energy and reserves, ISO shall

perform on-going response rate auditing using historical data as needed to

1.

verify that offered resource response rates are reflective of the resource’s
Real-Time performance.

2. ISO shall periodically provide Lead MPs with observed response rates based

upon a resource’s MW offer blocks. Observed response rates are determined

2.

using the method described in OP-23, Appendix K - Response Rate Auditing
Calculation (OP-23K).

3. The Lead MP shall use the provided observed response rates to offer the

resource. The offered MW/Manual Response Rate (MRR) blocks may differ
from the provided observed MW/MRR blocks due to ambient temperature or 3.
Real-Time resource configuration. The Lead MP may contact ISO regarding
provided observed response rates by emailing RRAudits@iso-ne.com.

4. ISO shall restrict the MRR offer to the maximum expected response rate
4.

based upon historical observations.

5. The Lead MP may provide ISO with a restoration plan for response rates as

provided for in Section III.1.5.2 of the Tariff - ISO-Initiated Parameter Auditing 5.
by emailing RRAudits@iso-ne.com.

6. ISO shall observe response rates following any completed restoration plan

and shall modify response rate restrictions based upon observed response 6.
rates.


-----

7. For resources that are newly-determined ready to respond to ISO dispatch by

ISO, the Lead MP shall offer response rates based upon the most accurate
manufacturer, observed, or tested values. ISO shall observe the resource’s 7.
response to Dispatch Instructions and when sufficient historical data has been
obtained, ISO shall provide observed response rates to the Lead MP.


-----

**III.** **CLAIMED CAPABILITY AUDITS**

**A. Generator Assets:**

**1. General Auditing Provisions**

a. In order to establish and maintain accurate records of Generator Asset real

power capabilities, all Generator Assets registered with ISO shall perform
real power capability auditing as required in Section III.1.5.1 of the Tariff Claimed Capability Audits.

b. To recognize certain operating characteristics, the following conditions

shall apply:

(1) The Claimed Capability Audit (CCA) values of a gas turbine,

combined cycle, or pseudo combined-cycle generator shall be
adjusted for ambient temperature, and steam exports in accordance
with Section III.1.5.1 of the Tariff, and using the procedures in OP-23,
Appendix B - Capability Determination for Thermal, Pumped Storage,
and Weekly Cycle Hydro Generator Assets (OP-23B).

(2) The Claimed Capability values of non-intermittent daily cycle hydro

Generator Assets shall be based on Generator Asset characteristics
and historical monthly river flow data, as detailed in OP-23, Appendix
C - Capability Determination for Daily Cycle Hydro Generator Assets
(OP-23C). Non-intermittent daily cycle hydro Generator Assets do not
perform Establish or Seasonal CCAs.

**2. Interdependence of Equipment**

a. Any CCA value of a Generator Asset shall reflect any limitations based

upon the interdependence of common elements between two or more
Generator Assets such as: auxiliaries, limiting operating parameters, and
the deployment of operating personnel. Generator Assets that share
equipment and/or personnel shall perform one of the following:

(1) Perform CCAs concurrently on all Generator Assets that share

equipment and/or personnel, to properly reflect the pertinent
limitations

(2) Certify that the Generator Assets do not have any common limiting

equipment and/or personnel by submitting OP-23, Appendix E - MultiGenerator Station Certification Form (OP-23E) to ISO.

**3. Establish Claimed Capability (Establish CCA)**

a. To change a Generator Asset Establish CCA value, an audit shall be

conducted. The Establish CCA audit shall be performed in accordance
with Section III.1.5.1.2 of the Tariff - Establish Claimed Capability Audit. To
verify that a request to establish or change the Establish CCA value will be
effective by the desired date, the Lead MP should request the audit with
sufficient advance notice to allow time for testing and processing. The


-----

change in audit value shall become effective in accordance with Section
III.1.5.1.2 of the Tariff and as follows:

(1) A Generator Asset that has been declared ready to follow Dispatch

Instruction by the ISO, but for which an Establish CCA has not been
conducted, may participate in the New England Markets using the
preliminary asset ratings and other characteristics from initial
registration forms, subject to later adjustments based upon
subsequent audited values.

**4. Seasonal Claimed Capability (Seasonal CCA)**

a. A Seasonal Claimed Capability Audit (Seasonal CCA) is a demonstration

of the capability of a Generator Asset that may be achieved through normal
dispatch and shall be conducted in accordance with Section III.1.5.1.3 of
the Tariff - Seasonal Claimed Capability Audits. A specific request by the
Lead MP is not necessary. The notification by a Lead MP of past
performance includes the date and time period of the demonstration to be
used, and other operating data (ambient temperature, steam exports,
elevations, etc.) as defined in OP-23B.

b. In accordance with Section III of the Tariff, ISO may issue a Seasonal CCA

window to indicate the hour(s) during which an audit performed would meet
the applicable temperature requirements. The audit window(s) is (are):

(1) **No less than one hour in duration.**

(2) Effective on a New England-wide basis.

(3) Issued for the third day from the day of posting (e.g., audit periods

posted on Monday will be applicable from 0001-2359 on Thursday).

c. Audit temperature windows are used to determine whether or not a

Generator Asset meets the temperature requirements of a Seasonal CCA
and are not to be interpreted as permission to perform an audit in RealTime. Generator Assets shall follow normal scheduling and dispatch
procedures for the performance of an audit in the Day-Ahead or Real-Time
Energy Markets.

**B. Demand Response Resources (DRRs)**

1. A Seasonal DR Audit is a demonstration of the capability of a DRR that may

be achieved through normal dispatch or through an audit request in the
DRATT software and shall be conducted in accordance with Section
III.1.5.1.3.1 of the Tariff. A specific request by the Lead MP is not necessary if
the Seasonal DR Audit is performed by the designation of a period of dispatch
after the fact.

2. The notification by a Lead MP of past performance shall include the date and

time period of the demonstration to be used.


-----

**C. ISO-Initiated Audits**

1. ISO may conduct an audit of the capabilities of a resource as specified in

Section III.1.5.1.4 of the Tariff - ISO-Initiated Claimed Capability Audits or that
is in addition to required Market Participant-requested audits. An ISO decision
to conduct such an audit shall be based upon objective criteria that suggest
that the Resource is claiming capability in excess of what the Resource’s
typical performance would indicate. Such criteria include, but are not limited
to any of the following conditions:

a. A consistent pattern of declaring an Economic Maximum Limit or Maximum

Reduction, adjusted for ambient temperature as appropriate, that is
inconsistent with the SCC, Seasonal DR Audit value, and/or Capacity
Supply Obligation (CSO)

b. Repeated failures of a resource to achieve its current SCC or Seasonal

DRR Audit value during audits

c. Repeated failures to meet Dispatch Instructions

2. Resources are compensated for these audits in accordance with Section III of

the Tariff.


-----

**IV.** **REACTIVE CAPABILITY AUDITS**

**A. Verification of Reactive Power Capability**

1. In accordance with the criteria described in Section III.1.5.3 (b) of the Tariff,

ISO, in consultation with the Local Control Centers (LCCs), shall determine
which Reactive Resources shall be required to perform Reactive Capability
Audits.

2. Reactive Resources that are required to perform Reactive Capability Audits in

accordance with Section III.1.5.3 (b) of the Tariff are listed in OP-23, Appendix
G - Reactive Resources Required to Perform Reactive Capability Auditing
(OP-23G).

3. Each Reactive Resource owner shall verify the reactive power capability of a

Reactive Resource that is listed in OP-23G. Reactive Resource owners shall
also verify the reactive power capability of a Reactive Resource whenever
such verification is otherwise required by ISO or the LCC.

4. If the results of the Reactive Capability Audit demonstrate that the reactive

capability of a Reactive Resource is different than the reactive capability
required under the Interconnection Agreement, then the Reactive Resource
owner shall resolve the discrepancy in accordance with the Section I.3.9 of the
Tariff - Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans and, as appropriate,
Schedule 22 (Large Generator Interconnection Procedures), Schedule 23
(Small Generator Interconnection Procedures) or Schedule 25 (Elective
Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Procedures) to the ISO’s Open Access
Transmission Tariff.

5. Resources that request to perform reactive capability testing other than that

required by ISO shall request that testing using Section IV.D and IV.E of this
OP.

6. DRRs are not considered Reactive Resources by ISO.

**B. Changes to the Reactive Capability of a Reactive Resource**

1. ISO, in consultation with the LCC, shall determine whether a change to the

reactive capability of the Reactive Resource, including a change to the size of
the storage capacity for an Electric Storage Facility (ESF), requires a new
Reactive Capability Audit for leading capability, lagging capability, or both.

2. A Reactive Capability Audit that is required due to a change in reactive

capability shall be performed as soon as possible but no later than six (6)
months from the date that the Market Participant (MP) was informed of the
requirement to audit.


-----

**C. General Auditing Instructions Applicable to All Reactive Resources**

**NOTE**

  - Lagging (over-excited) capability is defined as the Reactive Resource

providing reactive power to the electrical system and is denoted as a positive
value.

  - Leading (under-excited) capability is defined as the Reactive Resource

absorbing reactive power from the electrical system and is denoted as a
negative value.

1. The most recently performed Reactive Capability Audit shall be the audit of

record for a Reactive Resource.

2. Reactive Capability Audits for leading or lagging capability may be performed

at any time during the year. Certain Reactive Resources may be required to
perform Reactive Capability Audits at high or low loads due to the magnitude
of the reactive capability required to be demonstrated during the audit. In the
event that a Reactive Resource requires certain conditions in order to
demonstrate its capability, ISO, the LCC, and the MP shall work together to
determine an advantageous auditing window.

3. Reactive Capability Audits shall be performed at least every five (5) years

unless otherwise required by ISO or the LCC.

4. Reactive Capability Audits for Reactive Resources listed in OP-23G shall be

performed by the end of the calendar year listed in OP-23G unless other
direction is provided by ISO (e.g., auditing following a reactive capability
change).

5. Reactive Resources that will be listed in OP-23G but have not yet been

determined ready to follow Real-Time dispatch by ISO are required to perform
Reactive Capability Audits prior to being determined ready to follow Real-Time
dispatch, unless otherwise agreed to by ISO. ISO shall inform these Reactive
Resources of the auditing requirement through the ISO’s resource integration
process.

6. The Reactive Resource may perform real power or other required testing at

the same time as the Reactive Capability Audit so long as the requirements for
real and reactive power are met during the audit.

7. During the Reactive Capability Audit, the Reactive Resource shall absorb or

produce the maximum reactive power of the Reactive Resource such that the
Reactive Resource reaches a defined limit, given the current conditions and
limitations, for the entire audit duration. This limit may be internal to the
Reactive Resource (e.g., maximum excitation limiters (MEL), under excitation
limiters (UEL), volts/hertz limiters, terminal voltage, procedural) or external to
the Reactive Resource (e.g., transmission bus voltage). The MP shall provide
ISO and the LCC the limit reached by the Reactive Resource during the audit,
on OP-23, Appendix I - Reactive Capability Audit Data Recording Form (OP

-----

23I). OP-23I shall be submitted to ISO by attaching the file to an Ask ISO
issue.

8. Unless otherwise directed by ISO or the LCC, Reactive Resources comprised

of multiple dynamic devices (e.g., combined cycle, hydro, wind) shall perform
Reactive Capability Audits with at least 90% (rounded up) of the turbines or
inverters at the Reactive Resource on-line. For example, a Generator Asset
comprised of 18 turbines would be required to have at least 17 turbines online
at the time of the audit (i.e. 18 turbines*0.9 = 16.2 turbines; rounded up = 17
turbines).

9. In the event that reactive equipment or elements that may limit reactive

capability (e.g., transformers, feeders, etc.) are shared between multiple
Reactive Resources (e.g., pseudo-combined cycle assets, co-located solar
and storage facilities), those Reactive Resources may be required to test at
the same time in order to determine limitations. This includes, but is not
limited to, machines at the same combined-cycle facility and Reactive
Resources that share the same interconnection transformer.

10. The Reactive Resource shall have its Automatic Voltage Regulating

equipment (AVR), including any limiting functions such as MEL, UEL, etc., in
automatic and controlling a voltage setpoint during the Reactive Capability
Audit unless the technical capabilities of the Reactive Resource preclude
testing in this manner. If the AVR cannot be tested in automatic and
controlling a voltage setpoint, then the Reactive Capability Audit Request shall
state the conditions of the AVR during testing. AVRs may include, but are not
limited to: synchronous generator AVRs, wind plant controllers, and
distributed control systems (DCSs).

11. ISO, the LCC, and the Lead MP shall determine prior to the Reactive

Capability Audit if any additional available data is required to be submitted with
the required OP-23I data.

12. The Reactive Resource owner shall:

a. Record Reactive Capability Audit data at five (5) minute intervals and

submit that data to ISO on OP-23I. All Reactive Capability Audit data
required on OP-23I shall be submitted or ISO shall declare the Reactive
Capability Audit to be invalid.

b. Provide the status (in/out, etc.) and reactive loading for all reactive devices

(e.g., capacitors, reactors, statcoms, etc.) at the Reactive Resource during
the Reactive Capability Audit on a five (5) minute basis. Such data shall
be provided to ISO with the Reactive Capability Audit data required in OP23I.

c. Indicate on OP-23I which reactive device was most limiting (if the audited

facility is comprised of multiple reactive devices).

d. Provide MW and MVAR values on the high and low side of the

interconnection transformer (if an interconnection transformer is installed
and metering is available).


-----

e. Submit Reactive Capability Audit data to ISO within forty-five (45) days of

the date from which the data was obtained, for either a scheduled test or
an operational data submission.

13. ISO shall review the submitted Reactive Capability Audit data. ISO shall have

the ability to reject Reactive Capability Audit data that does not meet the
auditing requirements, or cannot be corroborated through other data means.

**D. Scheduling the Audit**

1. Based upon studies or Real-Time conditions, ISO or the LCC shall have the

ability to approve, propose an alternate auditing time, deny, or cancel a
Reactive Capability Audit at any time prior to or during that audit.

2. In order to perform a Reactive Capability Audit, the MP shall submit an outage

request as prescribed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3) or a Reactive Capability Audit
Request as prescribed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 Resource Maintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5).

**NOTE**

Situations where fewer than five Business Days notice may be approved,
include, but are not limited to, non-commercial testing of resources or ISOinitiated short notice operation of a resource that has yearly emissions or run
time limitations.

3. The outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request:

a. Shall be submitted through the ISO outage scheduling software at least

five Business Days prior to the day of the Reactive Capability Audit.

b. ISO and the LCC may agree to study an outage or Reactive Capability

Audit Request that is submitted fewer than five Business Days prior to the
day of the outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request. In order for an
outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request to be considered with fewer
than five Business Days notice, the MP shall:.

i. Consult with ISO and the LCC

**OP-20 Revision History ................................................................................................. 7**


-----

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

The interconnected Bulk Electric System (BES) is being operated at an everincreasing capacity factor. This increased duty has resulted in greater power
system sensitivity to faults, losses of equipment, and/or equipment malfunctions.
Accordingly, it is essential that power system behavior be carefully analyzed
following abnormal operations. These operations include not only severe system
disturbances, but also incidents that fall into the ""near miss"" or abnormal (versus
emergency) category.

This Procedure establishes responsibilities for conducting analyses of power
system incidents, including abnormal events, system conditions or disturbances
that impact the reliability of the BES as well as physical, cyber and communication
system sabotage / attack events. This Procedure also establishes responsibilities
for the distribution of reports resulting from such analyses. The reports resulting
from these analyses may also be used to fulfill the reporting requirements of the
Department of Energy (DOE), state regulatory bodies, the Northeast Power
Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC), and the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC), as applicable.

**II.** **EVENTS REQUIRING ANALYSES AND REPORTS**

**NOTE**

Reporting of emergency incident and disturbance events by ISO New England
(ISO), Market Participants (MPs), Local Control Centers (LCCs) and Transmission
Owners (TOs) to DOE, NERC and NPCC is performed in accordance with
applicable NERC Reliability Standards, NPCC Procedures and in accordance with
the process detailed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 10 Emergency Incident and Disturbance Notifications (OP-10).

ISO, considering input that may be provided by LCCs, TOs, MPs, and NPCC, will
determine whether it will conduct an analysis and prepare a report for the following
types of power system incidents:

1. Incidents that are reported to DOE, NERC, and NPCC, including but not

limited to:

a. System events resulting in system frequency excursions below the

initializing set points of the Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS)
program, as described in NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding

b. Disturbances or unusual occurrences that jeopardize the operation of the

BES, or result in system equipment damage or customer interruptions,
as described in NERC Reliability Standard EOP-004 - Event Reporting
(EOP-004)

c. Unforeseen failures of ISO critical operating tool(s), as described in

EOP-004


-----

2. Incidents involving the successful or unsuccessful operation of a special

relay protection system listed in the NPCC RAS SPS List Guide.

3. Incidents that, in the judgment of the Master/Local Control Center Heads

(M/LCC Heads), warrant review and analysis. These include, but are not
limited to:

    - Prolonged (sustained) oscillations

   - Severe voltage excursions

    - Multiple and simultaneous loss of large generators and/or transmission

system elements

    - Loss of significant customer load

4. Incidents that ISO determines must be analyzed for NERC Reliability

Standard MOD-033 - Steady-State and Dynamic System Model Validation
(MOD-033) to compare simulations using planning model cases to RealTime system performance

**A. CONDUCTING ANALYSES AND DEVELOPING AND DISTRIBUTING REPORTS**

1. Responsibilities;

   - ISO is responsible for determining the need to conduct analyses and

prepare reports of power system incidents. The severity of the incident
determines the depth of the analysis and the type of report (brief and
general or lengthy and detailed)
```
    o With the exception of system wide events, ISO may assign this

```
responsibility to the M/LCC Heads.

    - ISO is responsible for assigning responsibilities for conducting analyses

and developing reports of power system incidents, in accordance with
the following guidelines:
```
    o Assigned entities could include personnel from ISO, the LCCs, TOs

```
or MPs
```
    o The nature of the particular power system incident will normally

```
determine the make-up of the group assigned to participate in the
development of the analysis and report for the incident.
```
    o TOs and MPs affected by the power system incident will always be

```
assigned to participate in the development of the analysis and report
for that incident.
```
    o Lead responsibility for the development of the analysis and report for

```
a power system incident may be assigned to ISO, an LCC, TO, or
MP.


-----

  - ISO is responsible for providing actual system behavior data for

MOD-033 analysis (or a written response that it does not have the
requested data) to other Planning Coordinators within 30 calendar days
of a written request. Examples of actual system behavior data may
include, but are not limited to state estimator cases or other Real-Time
data (including disturbance data recordings).

  - Each LCC is responsible for providing actual system behavior data for

MOD-033 analysis (or a written response that it does not have the
requested data) to ISO or other Planning Coordinators within 30 calendar
days of a written request. Examples of actual system behavior data may
include, but are not limited to fault type and impedance data.

  - Each TO and MP is responsible for providing any power system incident

or pre-incident data (or a written response that it does not have the
requested data) to ISO within 30 calendar days of a written request.
Examples of actual system behavior data may include, but are not
limited to, sequence of events and fault recorder data.

2. Scope of Analysis and Time Schedule for Analyses and Reports:

  - The scope of analysis and level of detail in the report will be determined

by ISO, or the M/LCC Heads if assigned the responsibility by ISO, in
accordance with applicable NERC Standards.

  - The time schedule for conducting the analysis and developing the report

will be determined by ISO, or the M/LCC Heads if assigned the
responsibility by ISO, in accordance with applicable NERC Standards.

3. Contents of Report

The report will include comments pertaining to the following, as applicable:

  - Dates and times of events

  - Executive summary of analysis

  - Pre-incident BES conditions (weather, load, generation patterns, outages

of generation and transmission prior to incident, inter-area transfers,
inter-regional transfers, frequency schedules, key bus voltages)

  - Immediate post-incident BES conditions (similar to pre-incident items)

  - Amounts of load/generation lost

  - Potential items for analysis:
```
   o Relay operations - correct; correct but undesirable; incorrect
   o Damaged equipment

```

-----

```
   o Causes
   o Injuries
   o Reliability of system (pre; post)
   o Comparison of actual behavior and simulation
   o Violations of established Procedures, Criteria, Rules and Standards,

```
etc.
```
   o Lessons learned
   o Recommendations

```
  - Action Items, as applicable:
```
   o MPs
   o LCCs
   o TOs
   o ISO 

```
4. Final Report Distribution

Final reports will normally be distributed to the NEPOOL Reliability
Committee (RC), LCC Operating Committees, M/LCC Heads and personnel,
and the NPCC Task Force on Coordination of Operations (TFCO). The RC
may authorize other distributions as determined by the nature of the incident
and contents of the report.

**ISO New England Inc. & Northeast Gas Association Electric/Gas Operations Communications Protocol**

## ISO New England Inc.
 &
 Northeast Gas Association
 Electric/Gas Operations Communications Protocol

 Approved by the
 Electric/Gas Operations Committee
 On June 27, 2017

**_Introduction_**

The purpose of this Electric/Gas Operations Communications Protocol (the “protocol”) is to
enhance communication between ISO New England Inc.* (ISO-NE) and the Northeast Gas
Association’s** (NGA) member companies. This protocol identifies the mechanisms to be used
should ISO-NE need the assistance of any regional natural gas company(s) to help mitigate
electric power grid operating emergencies and/or other abnormal conditions jeopardizing the
reliability of New England’s electric power system. The reciprocal is true of the regional natural
gas industry. This protocol was first developed in 2004 and is regularly reviewed and updated
by ISO-NE, NGA and NGA’s member companies.

**_Regular Information Flow_**

Ongoing communication is expected to occur between the electric and natural gas industries on a
daily basis as part of their regular business processes. For example, regular communications
occur between ISO-NE and electric generators interconnected with the regional transmission
system and communications also occurs between those generators, specifically gas-fired
generators, with their corresponding transportation service providers (TSP), i.e. the operating
personnel of interstate or intrastate pipelines, local gas distribution companies (LDCs), and other
natural gas suppliers. Communication may also occur between ISO-NE and the operating
personnel of an interstate natural gas pipeline company.

It is anticipated that most issues or events will be mitigated through this regular information
flow, which are in place to support their bilateral and contractual arrangements (ISO to
generator, generator to pipeline, ISO-NE to pipeline).

If conditions on either the regional electric power system or the regional natural gas grid are
considered abnormal (i.e., severe weather, capacity deficiencies, energy emergencies,
infrastructure failures, etc.), and these conditions are either declared in real-time or projected

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

within a forecast, then the potential exists for additional or enhanced electric/gas
communications.

The communications described in this Operating Procedure will take place as needed (i.e. more
than once) to ascertain the level of knowledge and understanding concerning system status,
problem duration, and identification of remedial activities or mitigation methods.

ISO-NE may contact any regional gas delivery entity (and vice versa) anytime it has questions
regarding real-time or forecast conditions of the natural gas system or electric power system.
Natural gas delivery entities may also contact NGA regarding any key developments or
regarding any prior communications they have had with ISO-NE. The status of individual
interstate pipelines is routinely posted on their electronic bulletin boards (EBB). The
information requested by ISO-NE and subsequently provided by the natural gas company (and
vice versa) may be of any level of classification (e.g. confidential information) provided that the
receiving party agrees that such information will be handled in accordance with the requirements
of FERC Order No. 787***. Confidential information regarding specific generators will be
shared only with the pipeline serving that generator directly and ISO-NE has determined that it is
operationally necessary to ensure reliability to disclose the confidential information. The
information discussed will also comply with NGA’s and the gas industry’s anti-trust and market
confidentiality contractual agreements.

Another mechanism for industry coordination is the Electric/Gas Operations Committee
(EGOC). The EGOC was jointly established by ISO-NE and NGA in 2004. It is comprised of
representatives of the electric and natural gas delivery systems in the northeast; ISO-NE, on
behalf of the bulk electric power industry, and NGA (interstate pipeline companies, the regional
LNG importer, and local gas distribution companies), on behalf of the regional natural gas
industry. The EGOC is jointly administered by ISO-NE and NGA. Throughout the year, the
EGOC convenes on a periodic basis, through meetings and conference calls. The EGOC’s
purpose is to provide a forum for electric and natural gas representatives to learn more about
each other’s systems and share information on system operations, planning and procedures. The
meetings and information-sharing abide by each industry’s antitrust and information policies and
only address publicly-available information. Meeting minutes are approved and publicly
available.

**_Real-Time Communications_**

If the electric power system is currently experiencing an abnormal event or an event projected to
occur near-term, or should there be a gas delivery interruption that would potentially impact fuel
deliveries to gas-fired generating units, or even a projection of extreme weather, the level of
coordination between the electric and gas industries will likely increase. ISO-NE has several
procedures that, when implemented, may require increased communications between both
parties:

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

1) Master/Local Control Center Procedure No.2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert (M/LCC2)
2) Operating Procedure No. 4 – Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4).
3) Operating Procedure No. 7 – Actions in an Emergency (OP-7).
4) Operating Procedure No. 21 – Energy Inventory Accounting and Actions During an

Energy Emergency (OP-21).

5) SOP-RTMKTS.0050.0007 - Perform Cold Weather Condition Operations

The regional gas pipelines and LDCs also have procedures that, when implemented, may
contemplate increased communications between both parties (i.e. Critical and Non-Critical
Notices). The interstate pipelines post relevant information on their EBBs. Interstate pipeline
information may be accessed through the Informational Postings section of their EBBs. Relevant
information includes both Critical and Non-Critical notices as well as Planned Service Outages
and available capacity. If a gas supply situation emerges that has implications for the Northeast,
a NGA member company can request that NGA convene its Gas Supply Task Force (GSTF) to
assess the situation and consider remedial actions that may be taken by GSTF members to
alleviate the situation. NGA will institute the procedures outlined in its GSTF charter.

**_One-Company To One-Company Communications_**

If either entity, the electric power grid or a natural gas pipeline/LDC is experiencing abnormal
system conditions, information will be shared on a one-company to one-company basis, either
through an initial telephone call, an email message, or posting of relevant information on a
respective web site or electronic bulletin board. (e.g. ISO-NE Control Room to individual
pipelines). Some interstate pipelines also offer subscription services that allow users to subscribe
to e-mail messages for Critical and Non-Critical notices to be sent electronically to email
inboxes.

**_Communication Between ISO-NE And NGA_**

NGA administers a long-established committee of gas supply officials through its Gas Supply
Task Force (GSTF). The GSTF is comprised of representatives from the major LDCs in the
Northeast, as well as from all the regional interstate pipelines and the regional LNG supplier.
The GSTF was established to monitor and assess any regional gas supply or deliverability issue
concerning the natural gas system in the greater Northeast. The GSTF may also be convened to
address other non-regional issues, that may have the potential to impact the Northeast (i.e. gulf
coast hurricanes damaging oil and gas infrastructure). The GSTF abides by NGA’s anti-trust
guidelines in all its deliberations. Via telephone or email message, NGA will debrief ISO-NE of
all meetings of the GSTF, as it also does for officials of state public utility commissions and
energy agencies serving the northeast region. NGA has served as a liaison (conduit) between
ISO-NE and the GSTF in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

**_Industry Contact And Coordination During Non-Business Hours_**

Should an emergency situation develop during non-business hours, i.e. in the middle of the night
or a weekend, the primary contact will be between the control rooms of the electric grid operator
(ISO-NE) and the natural gas pipeline(s) or LDCs. NGA has included contact information for

ISO-NE and the New York ISO (NYISO) within their update to their emergency communication
manual entitled, “Gas Supply Information for the Northeast Gas Industry,” as published annually
by the GSTF of NGA. This contact information can be used by any entity to contact the other.

###### Note [1]: Flow above LTE limit but below STE limit can be used if flow can be returned below LTE limit within 15 minutes; otherwise, a lower rating will be used. Note [2]: This test is concerned with the failure of a RAS / ACS to trip a breaker. RAS / ACS are tested due to potential protection of an IROL; Limited Impact RAS / ACS are
 designed to protect SOLs only and are not tested.
 Note [3]: Normal and delayed fault clearing as defined by NPCC.

Reporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency

Appendix A – RETIRED (06/15/2021)

Appendix B - Electric/Gas Operations Committee’s (EGOC) Operations
Communications Protocol

## I. INTRODUCTION

This Operating Procedure (OP) documents the processes, and establishes the
associated requirements for ISO New England Inc. (ISO) to:

1. Collect fuel availability and environmental limitation information for each coal, oil,

natural-gas fired, and any other Resources that ISO determines to be necessary

[referred to as “applicable Resource(s)” for the purposes of this OP] from each
respective Lead Market Participant (Lead MP);

2. Forecast and report on expected energy availability over a 21-day look-ahead

period;

3. Declare Energy Alerts and Energy Emergencies based on forecasted or Real-Time

system conditions;

4. Take appropriate action in anticipation of, or during, an Energy Alert or Energy

Emergency;

5. Communicate with interstate natural gas pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)

import facilities, local gas distribution companies (LDCs), Designated Entities
(DEs), and Lead MPs regarding all matters related to Resource fuel availability
and environmental limitations;

6. Collect information related to winter readiness preparations from each Generator

Asset;

7. Collect information related to natural gas pipeline system critical infrastructure.

This OP also documents the responsibilities of Lead MPs of applicable Resources for
completion of periodic surveys, related communications and reporting requirements, and
expectations for responses related to an ISO declaration of an Energy Alert or an Energy
Emergency. Nothing in this OP shall relieve Lead MPs from their obligations under the
Tariff.

Energy Emergencies (defined in Section III.C of this OP) may occur at any time as a
result of sustained national or regional shortages in fuel availability or deliverability to
New England’s Resources. Such shortages of fuel may occur in many forms, including,
but not limited to: severe drought, interruption to availability or transportation of natural

Reporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency

Any of the conditions listed below, or a combination of these conditions, may contribute to
an Energy Emergency (this is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of possible initiating
conditions):
```
  o One or more pipeline operational flow orders (OFOs) have been declared
  o Significant reductions of Resource capability due to natural gas-related issues
  o Weather forecast for an extended period of cold or hot weather
  o Fuel delivery to a significant number of fossil fuel-fired generating Resources is, or

```
may be, impaired
```
  o Prolonged drought
  o Adverse weather conditions within the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada, or

```
regional shale gas basins
```
  o Abnormal conditions at regional LNG import, satellite storage, or LNG trucking

```
facilities
```
  o Extremely cold regional, national, or international weather conditions
  o Extreme storm conditions off-shore in the Maritimes
  o Any viable threat to one or more of the interstate natural gas pipelines or LDCs

```
supplying New England
```
  o Prolonged, significant reductions of capability to import power into the New

```
England region
```
  o Any other serious threat to the integrity of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for which

```
ISO determines that the actions of this OP may mitigate the impact

A sustained environmental limitation on some, or several, of New England’s Resources
may also contribute to an Energy Emergency.

Energy Emergencies are envisioned to last much longer than capacity deficiencies, which
are managed through ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Actions During a
Capacity Deficiency (OP-4) and, under extreme circumstances, through ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Actions in an Emergency (OP-7). Operable
capacity deficiencies are typically experienced at seasonal peak load conditions or upon
the occurrence of other emergent system conditions and tend to last for a few hours per
event. Because fuel shortages and/or environmental limitations may impact New
England’s ability to fully meet system load and Ten-Minute Reserve Requirements for
days, weeks, or months at a time, ISO may need to take action in advance of a projected
Energy Emergency to manage and preserve fuel supplies within the region. Unless ISO
takes action to address projected Energy Emergencies, a fuel shortage and/or
environmental limitations may lead to a significant loss of Resource capacity and more
extreme use of OP-4 and OP-7 actions.

Reporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency

The objectives of this OP are:

1. To facilitate strong lines of communication among ISO, interstate natural gas

pipelines, LNG import facilities, LDCs, DEs, and Lead MPs regarding all matters
relating to Resource fuel availability and environmental limitations

2. To facilitate identification of critical infrastructure of the interstate natural gas

pipeline system in order to ensure critical components are not included in
automatic or manual load shed schemes

3. To alert regional stakeholders of actual or anticipated near-term energy deficiency

conditions such that stakeholders with Resources in short supply of fuel, or with
potential environmental limitations, can take action to replenish fuel supplies
and/or take action to mitigate environmental limitations;

4. To alert regional stakeholders of potential energy deficiencies such that they may

take action to shorten or reschedule maintenance or repair to transmission
facilities or Resources throughout the region;

5. To raise the awareness of New England consumers, Lead MPs, officials of the

New England states, regional and national regulators, and regional and national
reliability organizations of potential energy deficiencies that may be faced by the
region;

6. To allow for timely implementation of load and capacity relief available within

actions of OP-4 or through implementation of load shedding through OP-7, in
order to address future capacity deficiencies expected as a result of an Energy
Emergency.

## II. ENERGY EMERGENCY FORECASTING AND REPORTING OVERVIEW

**A. ENERGY EMERGENCY FORECASTING AND REPORTING PROCESS**

**DESCRIPTION AND FORECAST ALERT THRESHOLDS**

ISO shall perform Energy Emergency forecasting and reporting based on available
data that includes the information received from Lead MPs through the Generator
Fuel and Emissions Survey submittals. Energy Emergency forecasting and
reporting is performed at the periodicity specified in Sections III.A, III.B, and III.C.
ISO performs Energy Emergency forecasting and reporting by using an hourly 21day energy assessment, and comparing the results of that assessment with the
Energy Emergency forecast alert thresholds (described below) in order to identify
and communicate potential reliability issues to regional stakeholders.

The Energy Emergency forecasts are non-binding as forecasted or expected
conditions utilized in the development of the forecasts can change. It is the
responsibility of the Lead MP to take all actions to ensure that Resources are able
to meet applicable obligations under the Tariff.

**Energy Emergency Forecast Alert Thresholds**
```
       o Forecast MLCC 2 (FMLCC2) – indicates that available Resources during any

```
hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less than 200 MW above
those required to meet Operating Reserve requirements.
```
       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 (FEEA1) – indicates that available

```
Resources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less
than those required to meet Operating Reserve requirements, and that the
implementation of OP-4 Actions 1 through 5 is being forecasted.
```
       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 2 (FEEA2) – indicates that available

```
Resources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less
than those required to meet Operating Reserve requirements and that the
implementation of OP-4 Actions 6 through 11 is being forecasted.
```
       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 3 (FEEA3) – indicates that available

```
Resources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be
insufficient to serve firm load requirements, and the implementation of firm
load shedding under OP-7 is being forecasted.

ISO shall identify and report each hour of all Operating Days within the 21-day look
ahead of the Energy Emergency forecast as one of the following: normal, FMLCC2,
FEEA1, FEEA2, or FEEA3.

ISO shall publish the results of each Energy Emergency forecast on the ISO
website. To the extent possible, for each instance where an Energy Emergency
forecast alert threshold was met, the results shall include the reason(s) why the
threshold was met.

Reporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency

**Energy Alert and Energy Emergency Declaration Criteria**

ISO shall declare an Energy Alert, and take actions as described in Section III.B of
this OP, when:
```
    o FEEA2 or FEEA3 is forecasted to occur in at least 1 hour on 1 or more

```
consecutive days in days 6 through 21 of the 21-day energy assessment, or
```
    o Any other reason(s) for which the ISO Chief Operating Officer (COO), or

```
designee, determines that the actions described in Section III.B of this OP
may mitigate the impact of an actual or forecasted energy deficiency.

ISO shall declare an Energy Emergency and take actions as described in Section
III.C of this OP, when:
```
    o FEEA2 or FEEA3 is forecasted to occur in at least 1 hour on 1 or more

```
consecutive days in days 1 through 5 of the 21-day energy assessment, or
```
    o Shedding of firm load under OP-7 is occurring or is anticipated to occur due

```
to an actual energy deficiency resulting from a sustained shortage of fuel
availability or deliverability to, or sustained environmental limitations on,
some or several of New England Resources, or
```
    o Any other reason(s) for which the ISO COO, or designee, determines that

```
the actions described in Section III.C of this OP may mitigate the impact of
an actual or forecasted energy deficiency.

For the purposes of this OP, ISO shall declare Normal Conditions any time when
neither an Energy Alert nor an Energy Emergency has been declared.

To the extent possible, ISO shall declare Energy Alerts and Energy Emergencies
on a daily boundary.

**B. COMMUNICATIONS**

During Normal Conditions (as described in Section III.A of this OP), the ISO shall
communicate with interstate natural gas pipelines/LDCs as often as necessary,
dependent on existing or forecasted system conditions. More frequent
communications may occur when warranted by electronic bulletin board (EBB)
notices or actual pipeline conditions.

In addition to the communications that occur during Normal Conditions, during an
Energy Alert or Energy Emergency (as described in Sections III.B and III.C of this
OP, respectively) additional or enhanced electric/gas communications may be
warranted. These communications serve to ascertain the status of the interstate
natural gas pipelines affecting New England, and increase awareness of activities
(e.g., maintenance) that may impact natural gas delivery to New England.

ISO shall communicate with interstate natural gas pipelines/LDCs in accordance
with the protocols outlined in OP-21, Appendix B - Electric/Gas Operations
Committee’s (EGOC) Operations Communications Protocol (OP-21B).

**ISO Responsibilities:**

      - Routine monitoring of interstate natural gas pipeline EBBs notices for

indications of potential pipeline curtailments and/or restrictions. If there are
indications of possible curtailments or restrictions, ISO is responsible for
contacting the Lead MP through its DE for each applicable gas-fueled
generator and seeking confirmation that each applicable gas-fueled
generator has sufficient gas scheduled to its meter(s) to support its
scheduled commitment for the next Operating Day.

      - Contacting any interstate natural gas pipeline/LDC as necessary regarding

Real-Time or forecast conditions on the regional natural gas system.

      - Emailing expected electric sector gas consumption hourly load profiles to the

interstate natural gas pipelines.

      - Reviewing natural gas nominations, via each interstate natural gas pipeline

EBB, and contacting the applicable Lead MP through its DE for its respective
gas-fueled generator that may indicate a deficient natural gas supply for the
current or next Operating Day.

      - Contacting each dual-fuel generator after the Day-Ahead Energy Market

(DAM) is complete and verifying the type of fuel it anticipates using on the
next Operating Day.

      - Publishing the results of the Energy Emergency Forecast on the ISO

website.

ISO shall include the following questions on the annual Generator Winter Readiness
Survey. ISO may modify the survey questions, as necessary, if it determines that
additional information is needed to accomplish the objectives of the Generator Winter
Readiness Survey process, as described above.

1. Below what ambient temperature (°F) is it expected that this Resource would
no longer be able to start?

2. Below what ambient temperature (°F) is it expected that this Resource would
no longer be able to continue operating from an online state? Please describe
if this is based on a design temperature, a historical operating temperature or
current cold weather performance temperature determined by an engineering
analysis.

1 The Generator Winter Readiness Survey was initially completed prior to the winter period of 2019-2020,
in part, as a response to the FERC/NERC joint report, “The South Central United States Cold Weather
Bulk Electric System Event of January 17, 2018” issued on July18, 2019.

## VI. NATURAL GAS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SURVEY

To ensure that the critical infrastructure of the interstate natural gas system are not
served by electrical transmission or distribution circuits that may be subject to automatic
or manual load-shedding schemes, ISO shall annually perform a Natural Gas Critical
Infrastructure Survey.

**A. SURVEY PROCESS**

Annually, ISO shall distribute a survey to representatives of each interstate natural gas
pipeline company operating within New England as well as the Canaport LNG facility
located in Saint John, New Brunswick, CA and the Everett LNG facility in Everett, MA.

Each applicable representative should complete the survey by compiling a list of its
critical facilities. Critical facilities,[2] for the purposes of this survey, include infrastructure
that is critical to the reliable flow of natural gas to customers, including natural gas-fired
generating facilities and thereby requires a supply from the electrical grid to maintain
operations.

ISO may modify the survey questions, as necessary, if it determines that additional
information is needed to accomplish the objectives of the Natural Gas Critical
Infrastructure Survey process, as described above.

ISO shall forward completed surveys to the applicable Local Control Center(s) to
facilitate a review of load shedding procedures, schemes, and circuits to verify that
natural gas infrastructure deemed to be critical is not connected to or located on any
predefined electrical circuits.

**B. SURVEY QUESTIONS**

The following data points are requested for each component identified to be a critical
facility:

1. Physical address of component
2. Applicable meter number
3. Feeder name/number (if known)

**C. DATA RETENTION REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING**

ISO shall retain all data submitted in response to Natural Gas Critical Infrastructure
Surveys for not less than 36 months.

2 Examples of critical facilities, for the purposes of this survey, includes, but is not limited to; LNG
liquefaction/vaporization facilities, control centers, gate stations, pipeline compressor stations, and other
components/facilities deemed critical to operations by each pipeline or facility

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) describes reliability criteria for the analysis and
operation of the New England Transmission System. Prescribed operator actions
are further detailed in several ISO New England (ISO) Transmission Operating
Guides.

The provisions of this OP are used to determine data, methods, and limits for
operation of the New England Transmission System. ISO, as the System
Operator, is responsible for, among other things, matters pertaining to the central
dispatch of each transmission facility over which it has operational control
pursuant to the Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA). ISO is responsible for
operating all transmission facilities rated 115 kV and above. Local Control
Centers (LCCs) are responsible for operating all transmission facilities rated 69
kV and below. LCCs have exclusive operating responsibility for all 69 kV facilities
with the exception of certain facilities listed in Master / Local Control Center
Procedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment F (M/LCC
15F), List of 69kV Facilities Currently Under ISO-NE Operational Control. The
New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO New England
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and includes the Reliability
Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA),[1] Bulk Electric System,[2]
and bulk power system elements found within New England on the transmission
network.

This OP describes how ISO and each LCC plan to operate within all System
Operating Limits (SOLs) and Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits (IROLs).

**A. Purpose**

The purpose of this OP is to describe how each Transmission Owner (TO), the
ISO, and each LCC [as Transmission Operators (TOP-)[3]]:

      - Monitor the New England Transmission System and determine ratings,

criteria and limits for their operation under NORMAL and EMERGENCY
system conditions.

     - Analyze and operate the New England Transmission System under those

two categories of system conditions.

This OP provides for the reliability of the New England Transmission System and
addresses the execution and coordination of activities that impact inter- and intraregional reliability, including:

      - Monitoring and controlling voltage levels and real / reactive power flows

      - Switching transmission elements

      - Planned outages, including outages of protection systems

1 RCA/BAA are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 Bulk Electric System is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
3 Transmission Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.

     - Responding to IROL and SOL exceedances

**II.** **RELIABILITY RATINGS, CRITERIA AND LIMITS FOR TRANSMISSION**
**OPERATIONS**

**A. Background**

ISO operates the New England Transmission System to account for
contingencies. A contingency is the unexpected failure or outage of a system
component such as a generator, transmission line, circuit breaker, switch or other
electrical element. The New England Transmission System is operated reliably to
avoid adverse impacts, pre-contingency, and after single-element and certain
multiple-element contingencies. Adverse impacts may include, but are not limited
to:

     - Equipment damage due to thermal overload

     - Cascading thermal overloads

     - Excessively high or low voltage or voltage collapse

      - Unit or area instability

     - Unacceptable post-transient voltage sag

     - Uncontrolled system separation

     - Unacceptable damping

A single contingency may result in the loss of one or more elements. Single
contingencies within the New England RCA/BAA shall not result in a violation of
the operating reliability criteria of another RCA/BAA. Loss of small portions of the
New England Transmission System (such as radial portions) may be tolerated
provided they do not jeopardize the reliability of the remaining New England
Transmission System and the Interconnection.[4]

This OP includes specific definitions, ratings, limits, and criteria for two categories
of system conditions (NORMAL and EMERGENCY), as well as two associated
levels of transmission transfer capabilities for the New England Transmission
System. During NORMAL system conditions, a higher level of prescribed
reliability is maintained. During EMERGENCY system conditions, a lower level of
reliability is permitted to allow for increased operating flexibility.

For the purposes of this OP, “facility ratings” are the maximum or minimum
voltage, current, frequency, or real or reactive power flow through a facility that
does not violate the applicable equipment rating of any equipment comprising the
facility. “Facility ratings” and “ratings” are used interchangeably throughout this
OP. Facility ratings are provided by each TO.

For the purposes of this OP, “facility limits” or “limits” are the ratings used for
facilities in system operations. For example, a TO may offer a facility thermal

4 Interconnection is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

rating for a transmission line, but once the thermal rating is put into use by the
TOP, that facility rating becomes a facility limit. TOs provide ratings, while TOPs
provide limits. A TOP may directly provide a facility limit to ISO.

For the purposes of this OP, “criteria” are applicable guidelines or rules used
when establishing limits. Examples of criteria are the rules applied to establish
stability limits (i.e., no loss of synchronism, acceptable damping and post-fault
voltage performance). Criteria are not ratings or limits.

This OP utilizes the following thermal capacity ratings for transmission facilities,
as described in ISO Planning Procedure No. 7, Procedures for Determining and
Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England (PP7):

 - Normal Rating (Normal)
```
   o Normal is a continuous 24-hour rating

```
 - Long Time Emergency Rating (LTE)
```
   o LTE is a 12-hour summer rating and 4-hour winter rating

```
 - Short Time Emergency Rating (STE)
```
   o STE is a 15-minute rating

```
 - Drastic Action Limit (DAL)
```
   o DAL is a 5-minute rating

```
The use of these ratings requires the pre-contingent facility loading to be at or
below the Normal rating and that the facility loading be returned to or below the
Normal rating after the daily load cycle. For the New England Transmission
System, a load cycle is defined as:

 - A continuous 12-hour period during the summer

 - A continuous 4-hour period during the winter

Both summer (April 1 to October 31) and winter (November 1 to March 31) facility
ratings are established for each of these categories of ratings. These categories
of ratings are as prescribed in PP7, which contains the facility ratings
methodology that is used by all TOs in the New England RCA/BAA.

For any facility that has two or more sets of thermal limits applicable (due to
multiple TOs, for example), the most conservative thermal limits shall be used.

This OP utilizes the following high and low voltage limits for transmission
substations, as supplied to ISO and the LCCs by the TOs:

  - Normal Voltage Limit (NORMVL)
```
     o NORMVL is a continuous 24-hour voltage limit

```
  - Long Time Emergency Voltage Limit (LTEVL)


-----

```
     o LTEVL is a voltage limit for a minimum of 30 minutes (duration

```
provided by TO)

  - Short Time Emergency Voltage Limit (STEVL)
```
     o STEVL is a 15-minute voltage limit

```
  - Drastic Action Voltage Limit (DAVL)
```
     o DAVL is a 5 (five) minute voltage limit

```
Figure 1 below shows an example set of voltage limits, with both the allowed
voltage level and acceptable time duration indicated in the figure. Operation at
voltage levels and time durations within the shaded area, including the
boundaries, is within the limits and reliable, and therefore does not result in an
SOL exceedance. Operation at voltages and time durations outside of the shaded
area may result in an SOL exceedance. For any facility that has two or more sets
of voltage limits applicable (due to multiple TOs, for example), the most
conservative limits shall be used by ISO and the LCCs. Appendix K to this OP,
Operating Voltage Limits by LCC (OP-19K) and Master / Local Control Center
Procedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment H (M/LCC
15H), Voltage SOL Identification Procedure, provides these limits

The set of voltage limits, NORMVL, LTEVL, STEVL, and DAVL, may include both
“high” and “low” limits, but only the NORMVL set is required to include both “high”
and “low” limits. Each set of NORMVL limits has a high and low limit, which
together describe the voltage operating bandwidth using the NORMVL. The
example, shown in Figure 1 above, shows a “high” NORMVL of 1.05 per unit and
a “low” NORMVL of 0.95 per unit; it also shows an apparent LTEVL “low” limit of


-----

0.90 per unit with no corresponding LTEVL high limit.

ISO and each LCC shall take actions to establish and maintain NORMAL system
conditions. ISO and the LCCs shall avoid regular cycling between NORMAL and
EMERGENCY system conditions and shall not intentionally position daily
operations into EMERGENCY system conditions for first contingency coverage.

1. IROLs and SOLs

ISO establishes limits for the most critical system operating parameters of
the New England Transmission System which preclude, on a pre- and
post-contingency basis, adverse impacts, as described above.

a. SOLs

An SOL is a value (such as MW, MVAr, Amperes, Frequency or Volts)
that satisfies the most limiting of the prescribed operating limits for a
specified system configuration to operate within acceptable reliability
criteria and ratings. ISO SOLs are based upon the following operating
limits:
```
   o Facility limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency equipment or

```
facility limits)
```
   o Transient stability limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency stability

```
limits)
```
   o System voltage limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency voltage

```
limits, i.e. steady-state voltage limits)

In ISO determination of SOLs, the New England Transmission System
conditions shall reflect:

(1) current or expected system conditions; and

(2) shall reflect changes to system topology such as facility outages,
including outages of protection systems, and de-ratings.

ISO SOL methodology requires that SOLs provide New England
Transmission System performance consistent with the following:
```
   o In the pre-contingency state:

```
     - The New England Transmission System shall demonstrate

acceptable transient, dynamic, stability, and voltage performance;

       - All facilities shall be within their facility limits (i.e., thermal, voltage,

and stability limits).
```
   o Following the single contingencies identified in Table 1 of Appendix J

```
to this OP - Contingency List and Criteria/Limits (OP-19J):

     - The New England Transmission System shall demonstrate

acceptable transient, dynamic, stability, and voltage performance;


-----

          - All facilities shall be operating within their facility limits and within

their thermal, voltage, and stability limits; and

         - Cascading or uncontrolled separation shall not occur.
```
      o In determining the New England Transmission System response to a

```
single contingency, the following are acceptable:

         - Planned or controlled interruption of electric supply to radial

customers or some local network customers connected to, or
supplied by, the faulted facility or by the affected area.

         - Interruption of other network customers, if the Real-Time operating

conditions are more adverse than anticipated in the corresponding
studies.

        - System reconfiguration through manual or automatic control or

protection actions.
```
      o To prepare for the next contingency, ISO may take or direct one or

```
more of the following actions to adjust the New England Transmission
System: re-dispatch of generation, demand, and external transactions,
and reconfiguration of the transmission system topology.

b. IROLs

ISO and each LCC operate the New England Transmission System so
that, in the pre- and post-contingent state, the system shall demonstrate
thermal, voltage, and stability performance within accepted limits. Any
SOL that has been identified by ISO to have an adverse impact beyond
the New England Transmission System is considered to be an IROL.
These IROLs require studies or post-event analysis for identification.
Examples of unacceptable system performance that may result in an IROL
include:
```
      o System instability.
      o An oscillatory or negatively damped system response.
      o An inability to determine if a discrete bounded sub-area of the system

```
is susceptible to voltage collapse or uncontrolled separation from the
rest of the system.
```
      o Analysis results that indicate the isolation of a sub-area supplying more

```
than 1,200 MW to the rest of the system, or absorbing more than 1,200
MW of power from the rest of the system.
```
      o Uncontrolled islanding is considered an IROL. Controlled islanding as

```
a result of proper operation of a Remedial Action Scheme (RAS)[5] to a
contingency for which it was designed is not considered an IROL (e.g.,

5 Remedial Action Scheme is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards


-----

islanding of Bangor, ME area and/or Maritimes transmission systems).
```
      o An identified sub-area of the system, that includes portions of the New

```
England Transmission System and/or another RCA/BAA, that is
susceptible to an exceedance of voltage limits or voltage collapse.
This determination shall be coordinated with the applicable Reliability
Coordinator (RC)[6] to determine if the event remains classified as an
IROL.
```
      o Facilities of another RCA that exceed their applicable facility limits for a

```
contingency within the New England Transmission System. This
determination shall be coordinated with the applicable RC to determine
if the event remains classified as an IROL.

Changes in network load, topology, and generation dispatch may alter the
system response to an event and make what is normally an SOL into an
IROL, or make what is normally an IROL into an SOL. ISO methodologies
for determining which SOLs are IROLs shall rely upon predictive analysis
techniques and may utilize Day-Ahead/Real-Time information to assess
the system.

2. Transmission System Analysis

Analysis and modeling of the New England Transmission System is required
for reliable operation. ISO conducts next-day reliability analyses for the New
England Transmission System for reliable operation in anticipation of
NORMAL and EMERGENCY system conditions as well as contingency event
conditions. ISO conducts contingency analysis studies to identify potential
interface and other SOL/IROL exceedances.

Under NORMAL system conditions, the New England Transmission System
is operated to a level of reliability such that the loss of a major portion of the
system, or unintentional separation of a major portion of the system, would
not result from any contingencies referred to in Table 1 of OP-19J. Under
EMERGENCY system conditions, the New England Transmission System is
operated to a level of reliability such that the loss of a major portion of the
system, or unintentional separation of a major portion of the system, will not
result from any contingencies referred to in Table 2 of OP-19J.

**B. Normal System**

1. NORMAL System Conditions

The highest level of transmission reliability is achieved during NORMAL

system conditions on the New England Transmission System. In general,
this level of reliability is accomplished by satisfying NORMAL ratings, criteria
and limits for a wide range of contingencies (NORMAL System
Contingencies, as described in Section II.B.3 of this OP and defined in Table
1 of OP-19J) using a limited set of operator actions (NORMAL System
Actions, as defined in Section II.B.4 of this OP). Information about simulating

6 Reliability Coordinator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

the contingencies is located in Table 3 of OP-19J.

2. NORMAL System Ratings, Criteria and Limits

[NORMAL transfer capabilities are to be observed unless EMERGENCY ]

system conditions are declared.

2.1. NORMAL System Thermal Limits

a. For pre-contingency system conditions, including planned outages,

transmission line and equipment loadings shall not exceed the Normal
limit.

b. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, loadings

beyond the STE limits. Flows between the LTE and STE limits must be
reduced to or below the LTE limit as soon as possible but in a time not to
exceed 15 minutes from the event. If studies show that operators would
not be able to reduce flows to or below the LTE limit within 15 minutes,
pre-contingent actions shall be taken such that following any NORMAL
System Contingency flows can be reduced to or below the LTE limits
within 15 minutes. Actions that may be taken pre or post-contingency to
reduce flow are listed under NORMAL System Actions.

Previously established/provided DAL limits may be used only if authorized
by the TOP whose transmission facilities would be affected and flows
between the STE and DAL limits may be reduced to or below the LTE limit
immediately and in a time not to exceed 5 minutes from the event.

After a contingency and all appropriate NORMAL System Actions are
taken, the following shall occur:

i. Flows shall return to or below the Normal limit within the
appropriate SOL or IROL timer, if the next contingency results in
flow exceeding the LTE limit but below the STE limit; or

ii. Flows may remain between the Normal and LTE limits provided the
next contingency does not result in flow exceeding the LTE limit;
and

iii. Loadings shall be returned to or below the Normal limit after the
daily load cycle

If the TOP does not know if the next contingency would result in an IROL
or SOL, then the IROL timer shall be used.

If ISO Operations staff determines that neither of the above flow
requirements (i. or ii.) can be achieved after all appropriate NORMAL
System Actions are taken, ISO shall consider implementation of
EMERGENCY system conditions



[c. System condition allowances for switching activities that are typically ]

completed within 15 minutes are as follows:


-----

i. Pre-contingent system conditions during switching:

      - During the time period when switches are open, a transmission

facility may not exceed the LTE limit

ii. Contingency protection during switching:

       - During brief switching activities (typically 15 minutes or less, but

not to exceed 30 minutes), ISO shall only provide firstcontingency coverage as long as restoring the outage is not the
corrective action.

d. Without prior approval to operate to the STE limits, NORMAL System

Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, loadings on New York ISO
(NYISO) transmission facilities, including NYISO - ISO-NE RCA/BAA tie
lines, beyond the LTE limits.

2.2. NORMAL System Stability Criteria

a. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause instability of any single

unit, the system, or unacceptable system oscillations. When determining
acceptable system response, applicable criteria shall be applied,
including, but not limited to, post-transient voltage sag and damping.

b. Following a NORMAL System Contingency, unless specific instructions

describing alternate actions are in effect, system flows shall be adjusted
such that manual reclosing or automatic reclosing of a faulted element
may be carried out without affecting the stability of the New England
Transmission System.

c. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, NORMAL System

Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, any neighboring RCA/BAA to
exceed its stability criteria

2.3. NORMAL System Voltage Limits

a. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause unacceptably high or low

voltage in violation of limits or voltage collapse. The applicable voltage
limits are described in OP-19K and Master / Local Control Center
Procedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment E
(MLCC 15E) Transmission System Voltage Criteria Exceptions.

b. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, NORMAL System

Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, any interconnected RCA/BAA
to exceed its voltage limits

2.4. NORMAL System Miscellaneous Criteria

a. Generation and transmission service is scheduled to provide the New

England RCA/BAA load and operating reserve as prescribed in ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation
(OP-8) while covering NORMAL System Contingencies.


-----

b. An LCC may request more stringent operating limits. If such a request is

made, ISO shall evaluate the request and honor it if there is no adverse
system reliability consequence.

3. NORMAL System Contingencies

Table 1 of OP-19J identifies each type of contingency respected under
NORMAL system conditions, if it is respected for SOLs or IROLs, and the
appropriate thermal limits, voltage limits and stability criteria are applied. ISO
shall respect these limits and criteria in Real-Time and in off-line system
analyses. OP-19K describes the voltage limits that each LCC applies to its
system by voltage class.

The following M/LCC 15 Attachments address specific identified
contingencies, study methodologies and criteria, or their determination:

a. Attachment A 345 Stuck Breaker Contingencies That Can Have

Unacceptable Inter-Area Impacts (Confidential)

b. Attachment B 345 kV Double Circuit Tower Contingencies (Confidential)

c. Attachment C Contingency Impact Evaluation

d. Attachment D Bus Fault Contingencies (Confidential)

e. Attachment E Transmission System Voltage Criteria Exceptions

f. Attachment H Voltage SOL Identification Procedure

g. Attachment I Primary and Secondary Voltage ICCP IDs

h. Attachment K Voltage Task Force Work Scope

4. NORMAL System Actions

ISO and each LCC shall continuously assess system conditions and
implement the NORMAL System Actions described below to maintain or
restore transmission reliability to NORMAL system conditions. Actions for
SOL and IROL contingencies within the New England RCA/BAA shall use the
following NORMAL System Actions as required:

a. Adjusting Phase Shifting Transformers (PSTs)

PSTs may be adjusted, pre or post-contingent, to achieve a desired postcontingent flow result.

b. Adjusting Reactive Flows

Reactive flow may be adjusted through changes to shunt reactive devices
(capacitors or reactors), adjustments to load tap changing transformers
using manual operator action, or changes to generator/reactive device
voltage schedule setpoints or bandwidths to achieve a desired postcontingent voltage result.


-----

c. Weather-Sensitive Transmission Facility Ratings

There are times when actual ambient conditions (temperature and wind
speed) are significantly different from those used to establish standard
seasonal facility ratings. During those times, the use of temporary ratings
based on actual ambient conditions may be warranted. Depending on the
ambient conditions, the temporary ratings may be higher or lower than the
standard seasonal facility ratings. When such weather conditions exist
and a transmission facility is limiting, ISO, the appropriate LCC or
appropriate TO shall identify the need for a temporary transmission facility
limit based on actual weather conditions. In cases where the TO has
supplied pre-defined weather sensitive ratings, ISO and the appropriate
LCC shall use such ratings after the LCC and/or TO has
gathered/established the actual weather conditions. If pre-defined
weather sensitive ratings are not available, the appropriate LCC shall
inform the involved TO of the circumstances. The TO may elect to
provide the appropriate LCC with temporary ratings along with any
pertinent qualifications for their use. The appropriate LCC shall forward
and document all temporary rating information to ISO. Such temporary
ratings shall then be used in operations as limits for the time period
specified by the TO or until rescinded by the TO.

d. Deviation from Economic Dispatch

If the local area cannot be protected by economic dispatch, ISO and each
LCC shall use a non-economic dispatch if it would provide improved
system security. ISO shall deviate from economic dispatch and schedule
resources to maintain NORMAL system transmission reliability.

e. Use of an RAS

Where possible, with ISO approval, the LCC shall arm each RAS that
would relieve transmission limitations. When adequate facilities are not
available, an RAS may be employed to maintain system security. When
operating as designed, it is acceptable for an RAS to interrupt flows on a
system element if loading is in excess of an element DAL limit.

f. Manually set up the tripping of a generator or a Dispatchable Asset

Related Demand (DARD)

This preplanned option of opening a circuit breaker is limited to a situation
where previously documented studies have demonstrated that the breaker
opening reliably mitigates the specific existing operating condition and
does not result in the loss of single-contingency protection for another
contingency/facility.

g. Switch Transmission Elements

This action (open or close an element to relieve transmission constraints)
may only be implemented when documented studies have demonstrated
that the element opening or closing reliably relieves the specific existing
condition and does not result in the loss of protection for another


-----

contingency/facility and are agreed to by all applicable TOPs.

h. OP-4 Actions

Implement selected actions from OP-4 (Normal Actions of OP-4 include
Actions 1 through 5). These actions use generator maximum capabilities,
voluntary load curtailment of Market Participant's facilities,
capacity/energy purchases, contracted customer generation and depletion
of 30-minute reserves.

i. Use of Enhanced Facility Ratings or Limits

With the exception of all IROLs, if an SOL cannot be protected after
utilizing the applicable NORMAL System Actions (a through h above), a
TO or TOP may elect to modify the limiting thermal or voltage limit with an
enhanced rating or limit to mitigate a Real-Time or post-contingent
exceedance. When such a limit is provided for a post-contingent
exceedance, the LCC shall provide a post-contingent action plan for
contingency protection. All coordination required with the impacted TO/s
to provide contingency protection with enhanced ratings or limits and a
post-contingent action plan for the SOL is the responsibility of the LCC.
All enhanced ratings or limits and post-contingent action plans used under
this provision shall be communicated to ISO electronically prior to
implementation. Use of a recorded line is acceptable for these purposes.
Written documentation of the enhanced ratings or limits and action plans
shall be provided to ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed 24 hours. If
this option is not taken or is insufficient, pre-contingent load shedding
(OP-7) shall be required.

**C. Emergency System**

1. EMERGENCY System Conditions

The system is in an EMERGENCY system condition if any of the NORMAL
system ratings criteria or limits, as defined in Section II.C.2 of this OP, are
exceeded. Recognizing the limited exposure to EMERGENCY system
conditions, a revised set of contingencies is respected provided that ISO has
initiated all appropriate NORMAL System Actions to restore NORMAL system
ratings criteria or limits. This level of protection meets EMERGENCY System
Criteria for a less stringent set of contingencies (EMERGENCY System
Contingencies, as described in Section II.C.3 of this OP and as defined in
Table 2 of OP-19J) using EMERGENCY System Actions (as defined in
Section II.C.4 of this OP). Exposure to EMERGENCY system conditions that
do not meet EMERGENCY system ratings, criteria or limits shall not exist for
more than 30 minutes for an IROL. The set of contingencies respected under
EMERGENCY system conditions is described in Table 2 of OP-19J.
Information about simulating the contingencies is located in Table 4 of
OP-19J.

2. EMERGENCY System Ratings, Criteria and Limits

2.1. EMERGENCY System Thermal Limits


-----

[a. After a contingency,and after TOPs take all appropriate EMERGENCY ]

System Actions, the TOPs shall take actions so that:

i. Flows shall return to the Normal limit or below within the
appropriate SOL or IROL timer if the next contingency results in
flow exceeding the LTE limit but below the STE limit or

ii. Flows may remain between the Normal and LTE limits provided the
next contingency does not result in flow exceeding the LTE limit

iii. Loadings shall be returned to the Normal limit or below after the
daily load cycle



[b. If the TOP does not know if the next contingency would result in an IROL ]

or SOL, then the TOP shall use the IROL timer.

2.2. EMERGENCY System Stability Criteria

a. EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall not cause instability of any

single generator or the system, or unacceptable system oscillations.
When determining acceptable system response, the Operations engineer
or TOP shall apply appropriate criteria, such as post-transient voltage sag
and damping.

b. Following an EMERGENCY System Contingency, unless specific

instructions describing alternate actions are in effect, the TOP shall adjust
system flows such that manual reclosing or automatic reclosing of a
faulted element may be carried out without affecting the stability of the
New England Transmission System.

c. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, EMERGENCY System

Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, a neighboring RCA/BAA
exceeding its stability criteria.

2.3. EMERGENCY System Voltage Limits

a. EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall not cause unacceptably high

or low voltage in violation of Limits or voltage collapse. The applicable
voltage limits are described in OP-19K and M/LCC 15E.

b. Without prior TOP approval to operate otherwise, EMERGENCY System

Contingencies should not cause, or result in, a neighboring RCA/BAA
exceeding its voltage limits.

2.4. EMERGENCY System Miscellaneous Criteria

a. In EMERGENCY system conditions, ISO shall maintain generation and

transmission facilities adequate to supply the New England RCA/BAA
customer electricity demand and energy requirements and at least
minimum reserve requirements (10-minute requirements) as prescribed in
OP-8 while covering only EMERGENCY System Contingencies.

[b. An LCC may request more stringent system operating limits. If such a ]

request is made, ISO shall evaluate the request and honor it if there is no


-----

adverse system reliability consequence.

3. EMERGENCY System Contingencies

Table 2 of OP-19J identifies each type of contingency respected under
EMERGENCY system conditions, if it is respected for SOLs or IROLs, and
the appropriate thermal limits, voltage limits and stability criteria are applied.
ISO respects these limits and criteria in Real-Time and in off-line system
analyses. OP-19K describes the pre and post-contingency voltage limits that
each LCC applies to its system by voltage class. M/LCC15E documents the
exceptions to the voltage limits noted in OP-19K.

4. EMERGENCY System Actions

TOPs shall take EMERGENCY System Actions to maintain or restore system
conditions to at least those prescribed for operations under EMERGENCY
system conditions. In general, all appropriate and timely NORMAL System
Actions shall be exhausted before taking EMERGENCY System Actions.
TOPs shall take EMERGENCY System Actions before NORMAL System
Actions if the NORMAL System Actions cannot be completed in time to
relieve a thermal overload above the LTE limit, prevent voltage collapse, or
restore protection for EMERGENCY System Contingencies within 30 minutes
for an IROL. TOPs shall take any unused long-term NORMAL System
Actions to allow for the cancellation of EMERGENCY System Actions.

EMERGENCY System Actions may be needed to meet EMERGENCY

system ratings, criteria or limits even though a contingency has not occurred.
TOPs shall take such pre-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions when
NORMAL System Actions are exhausted or cannot be completed in a timely
manner and there would be insufficient time after an EMERGENCY System
Contingency to contain the impact as an SOL.

TOPs shall also initiate pre-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions when

a potential EMERGENCY System Contingency threatens to cause an IROL
violation. TOPs shall also take pre-contingency EMERGENCY System
Actions when a potential EMERGENCY System Contingency poses the same
threats to any RCA/BAA outside of New England or jeopardizes the reliability
of the Eastern Interconnection.

Operations department management at ISO and at each appropriate LCC, to

the extent that time permits, shall consult with affected TOs when developing
pre-contingency strategies.

The following is a list of EMERGENCY System Actions:

a. Transmission Element Switching Actions

Where it is clear that opening a transmission facility would alleviate a
problem that exists for a specific emergency situation, TOs shall give
consideration to opening such facility. TOPs shall initiate this action,
without pre-determined studies, documentation, and authority only to
prevent more severe EMERGENCY System Actions and shall immediately
report such action to the TO.


-----

b. OP-4 and OP-7 Actions

i. ISO shall implement selected actions from OP-4 (i.e., Emergency
Actions of OP-4 include Actions 6 through 11). These actions use
voltage reductions, additional use of generator maximum
capabilities, appeals for customer generation not contractually
available to Market Participants, voluntary load curtailment (large
industrial and commercial customers, radio and television appeals)
and notices to state Governors to reinforce Power Warning appeals
(as defined in OP- 4).

ii. OP-7 Action - Load shedding

c. Planned Immediate Post-Contingency EMERGENCY System Actions

If an EMERGENCY System Contingency does not risk system stability but
would result in low or gradually declining voltages or thermal loadings
between STE and DAL, ISO shall establish specific voltage reduction or
load shedding plans before the contingency for implementation
immediately after the contingency. ISO shall establish and coordinate
post-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions with each appropriate
LCC before the need for implementation arises. If automatic devices are
being used, each appropriate LCC shall confirm to the ISO the automatic
device actions to be completed in a matter of cycles or seconds after the
contingency. ISO shall complete manual actions as soon as possible after
the contingency. ISO shall reduce post-contingent loadings between STE
and DAL below LTE as soon as possible and in a time not to exceed 5
minutes from the event.

d. Use of Enhanced Facility Ratings or Limits

With the exception of all IROLs, if an SOL cannot be protected after using
the applicable EMERGENCY System Actions (a through c), a TO may
elect to modify the limiting thermal or voltage limit with an enhanced rating
or limit to mitigate a Real-Time or post-contingent exceedance. When
such a limit is provided for a post-contingent exceedance, the LCC shall
provide a post-contingent action plan for contingency protection. All
coordination required with the impacted TO/s to provide contingency
protection for the SOL is the responsibility of the LCC. The LCC shall
electronically communicate all enhanced ratings or limits and postcontingent action plans used under this provision to ISO prior to
implementation. The use of a recorded line is acceptable for these
purposes. The LCC shall provide written documentation of the enhanced
ratings or limits and action plans to ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed
24 hours. If enhanced facility ratings or limits are not used or are
insufficient, ISO shall implement pre-contingent load shedding pursuant to
OP-7.

**D. Post-Contingency Operation**

If a contingency involves the loss of a transmission element(s), LCC operators
should attempt to reclose the element(s) within 5 minutes unless otherwise


-----

specified in specific policies and/or procedures. If reclosure is unsuccessful, or
the contingency involved the loss of generation or load, ISO operators shall
assess system conditions and perform appropriate NORMAL and EMERGENCY
System Actions to restore NORMAL and EMERGENCY system conditions. When
possible, ISO shall restore coverage for NORMAL System Contingencies using
NORMAL System Actions.

ISO and LCC post-contingency actions shall meet the following time
requirements:

  - Rapidly declining critical transmission voltages shall be stabilized as quickly

as possible (within one or two minutes) and returned to operation within
system voltage limits using pre-determined NORMAL and/or EMERGENCY
System Actions.

 - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the STE and

DAL limits shall be reduced below the LTE limit immediately and in a time
not to exceed 5 minutes from the event using pre-defined NORMAL and/or
EMERGENCY System Actions.

 - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the LTE and

STE limits shall be reduced below the LTE limit as soon as possible and in a
time not to exceed 15 minutes from the event using appropriate NORMAL
and/or EMERGENCY System Actions.

 - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the Normal

and LTE limits shall be reduced below the Normal limit as soon as possible
and in a time not to exceed a load cycle using appropriate NORMAL and/or
EMERGENCY System Actions.

 - Coverage for EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall be restored within

the appropriate time for an SOL/IROL using appropriate NORMAL System
Actions and/or EMERGENCY System Actions.

## Instructions for the ISO New England Load Power Factor Survey

#### The purpose of this Appendix C to Operating Procedure No. 17 – Load Power Factor and System Assessment (OP-17C) is to establish a list of Transmission Load Customers (TLCs) and Transmission Load Customer Contacts (TLC Contacts) within each load power factor (LPF) survey area. The list of TLCs in Table 1 is not a comprehensive list of TLCs. 

 The current LPF standards can be found in an excel document on ISO’s external website by searching for “op17_lpf_standards.”

 For the purposes of LPF analysis, the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) has been divided into LPF areas as defined in OP17 Appendix A – Area Definitions (OP-17A). 

 Table 1 of this OP-17C lists each TLC, their LPF area, and their TLC Contact. For the purposes of ISO LPF communications, the TLC Contact is the point of contact for each TLC. Where the TLC and TLC Contact are different entities, the TLC Contact shall act as the communication channel between ISO and the TLC. TLC Contacts are specified because ISO does not have Transmission Compliance Contacts for all of the TLCs. Conversely, ISO’s Customer and Asset Management System (CAMS) does have a Transmission Compliance Contact for all of the TLC Contacts listed below. The TLC Contact names used in Table 1 are the names in CAMS in the “Customer Long Name” field, and due to the field’s character restrictions, some TLC Contact names are truncated.

 As explained in OP-17, the two scenarios in which ISO will be communicating to the TLC via the TLC Contact include:

 Annual LPF Survey with No Operating Issues:

 As specified in OP-17, the ISO shall conduct a survey of all LPF areas annually or more frequently as circumstances may dictate. Communication of this information will proceed as follows:

 1. ISO VTF Chair sends the LPF area survey results to the TLC Contacts.

 2. TLC Contacts forward the LPF area survey results to each of their associated TLCs within the surveyed area(s). 

 Operating Issue Related to LPF Non-Compliance: 

 As specified in OP-17, if an operating issue relating to LPF non-compliance is identified, communication will proceed as follows:

 1. ISO will request the applicable LCC(s) to confirm the TLCs in the non- compliant area(s). 

 2. ISO will send a data request to the TLC Contact for each TLC in the non- compliant area. 

 3. TLC Contacts forward the data request(s) to the indicated TLCs. In the most optimistic scenario, the TLC Contact will then have no further involvement because the TLC will reach out to ISO directly, as described in step 4 below. 


-----

#### However, in the event that there is no response from the TLC, ISO will re- send the data request to the TLC Contact and again, the TLC Contact forwards the data request to the indicated TLCs. 

 4. Upon receipt of the data request, the TLC is expected to respond directly to the ISO. The intention of the data request is to procure additional LPF data from the TLC to determine the TLCs involvement in the area’s non-compliant LPF performance. The data request will include ISO’s contact so that the TLC can communicate with the ISO directly.

#### I. Introduction

This Appendix A to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 - Metering and
Telemetering Criteria (“OP-18A”) defines the communications network processor (CNP)
requirements that Local Control Centers (LCCs) and Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) Control Centers (referred to herein as “sites”) shall comply with for
any Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) server operating on the ISO
New England (ISO) ICCP network.

The following main topics are discussed within this document:

     - Configuring and testing a new ICCP server

     - The format of the data exchange bilateral table

     - Data quality and status bit conventions

     - Coordinated database maintenance

#### II. ICCP Server Requirements

The ICCP software shall be certified by its vendor as compliant to the IEC 60870-6 TASE.2
standard (1996-8 or above).

Server redundancy is required with a minimum of 2 production servers; 1 production server
at the Enabled Control Center (ECC) and 1 production server at the Standby Control
Center (SCC) as applicable. Additionally, there shall be at least 1 development/test server
for use in verifying software and database changes prior to production implementation.

#### III. ICCP Network Configuration

The ICCP network for LCCs and SCADA TOs shall utilize diverse routing and redundancy
to ensure there is no single point of failure, consisting of three (3) distinct communications
paths. Each path shall include one router per network for each LCC and SCADA TO. Two
paths shall be telecom circuits and a third path with STN. All ICCP network failovers shall
occur automatically.

LCCs and SCADA TOs shall physically separate ISO-NE provided ICCP routers (i.e.
underlying electrical/environmental infrastructure, adjacent network infrastructure, etc.) to
eliminate single points of failure.

LCCs and SCADA TOs shall provide maximum physical diversity for all incoming telecom
& STN ICCP circuits to eliminate single points of failure.

Diagram 1 illustrates the ICCP network configuration for Control Centers.

Any exceptions and conditions upon variations from the network as described and shown
in Figure 1 shall be made by request for ISO approval.

Server connection parameters for all new or modified servers shall be published in the
ICCP “Association Information Exchange Form” (AIEF) through an electronically secure
method. A blank template of this form is provided as Attachment 1 to this OP-18A.

All ICCP sites shall connect to, and retrieve data from, the site in which the data source
originates. Data shall not be passed through from site A to site C through any other site.
Site C should get the data directly from site A. (i.e., data shall not be relayed through any
site.) See Diagram 2.


-----

Diagram 2

All dataset requests shall be configured in the most efficient manner with the following
criteria:

A. Similar data shall be grouped in the same dataset(s) such as analog versus status.

B. Datasets shall not exceed 600 data items unless agreed upon by all the ICCP sites.

C. Appropriate dataset properties shall be configured for each dataset to optimize

efficiency.

1. Statuses shall be reported by ‘exception’ (RBE) processing.

2. Analogs shall be reported in ‘periodic’ mode.

3. Data update rates shall not exceed those specified in OP-18.

#### V. Testing

The following testing shall be completed before a new server is placed into service as a
production system.

A. Network connectivity - verify firewall and routing

1. For new circuit installations, once the ICCP circuits are in place, ISO shall verify

communications to the router.

2. The remote site shall verify that it can ping the ICCP router at its local site from

each of its servers.

3. The remote site shall verify that it can ping all other remote site routers.

B. Association testing - verify AIEF connection parameters

1. For each new server, a connection shall be established to the

development/test server at each entity to which it connects. After all
development/test server testing is complete, a similar connection-testing
scheme shall be developed for each production server based on remote


-----

server capabilities.

2. Use of ICCP analyzer software may be necessary to debug issues at this

level.

C. Dataset testing

1. Verify partial dataset creation functionality.

2. Verify that periodic datasets update at the defined rate.

3. Verify that RBE datasets update only when data changes and at the defined

integrity poll time.

D. Data value testing

1. If the site has a live data feed to its new server, then point-to-point testing shall

occur for analog and status points.

2. The site shall confirm with all applicable associations that the same value and

polarity (for analogs) is received.

E. Data quality testing

1. If the site has a live data feed to its new server, then quality code testing shall

occur for analog and status points.

2. The site shall confirm with all applicable associations that the appropriate quality

codes are sent and received.

#### VI. Data Quality Flags

Typically, telemetered data is of good quality. However, there are a few common scenarios
in which manual intervention of quality codes shall be performed by the entity that owns the
data. The scenarios and recommended actions are as follows:

A. Scenario A - The analog values have a “BAD” quality code due to a communication

line, remote terminal unit (RTU), or other supporting equipment failure and the data
value is not updating. In this case, the value shall be manually updated as
frequently as appropriate or state estimator (SE) replacement data shall be
provided in its place. If the data is not critical, then it is acceptable to leave it as
“BAD” quality unless requested by another site. The determination of whether or
**not data is critical is made jointly by ISO and the LCCs or the SCADA Control**
Centers (SCCs).

B. Scenario B - The analog values have a “GOOD” quality code but the actual values

are wrong. This may be due to equipment that has “stalled” or is possibly being
worked on and is sending incorrect values. In this case, the data quality should be
modified to be either “BAD” quality, manually replaced, or SE replaced. If the value
is manually replaced, then it should be updated as frequently as appropriate.

For either scenario, OP-2 specifies the priority and timeframe in which repair efforts shall
be made. Repairs that do not comply with OP-2 requirements are subject to ISO review
and compliance investigation.


-----

#### VII. Data Definitions

Each site shall develop a data table for the following categories of power system data to aid
in the identification of the data to other interested parties. The definition in the data table
shall match the device name that exists in the field and in the one-line drawings.

A. Transmission station names

B. Transmission lines

C. Transformers

D. Generating stations/Resources

E. Breakers/switches

F. Other

#### VIII. Data Definition Updates

Each site shall be required to prepare an initial data table of ICCP data point identifiers in
Microsoft Excel format prior to connecting to the ICCP network. This data table is also
known as the bilateral table file. Subsequent updates shall be required as data definitions
are changed via additions, deletions, or modifications. ICCP IDs for new equipment shall
be published at least one (1) week prior to equipment energization. Each site shall assume
the responsibility for distributing its definition updates.

The ISO ShareFile web portal hosts the data file storage and distribution for these files. To
request access to the ShareFile site, each individual must contact the “Security
Administrator” representative from their entity and have them request “Citrix ShareFile LCC
Intercontrol Center Protocol” access for the individual through the ISO Customer and Asset
Management System (CAMS). Any update to these data files shall consist of the following
actions:

A. An email notice with a summary listing of changes shall be sent to the data

communication task force (DCTF) email distribution list.

B. The updated data file shall be uploaded to the ShareFile web portal.

#### C. The data file shall consist of one (1) tab that follows the descriptions further

described in section VIII of this document.

#### X. Coordinated Database Maintenance

A. **Annual deletion process**

Beginning in January and continuing through May of each year, each ICCP site shall identify
host data items to be deleted in November/December by marking them in the bilateral table
using the format specified in this OP-18A. This includes updating the change code field from
“RIP” to “DEL” and the change date field to 11/01/YYYY (where YYYY represents the current
year).

By June 30[th], a list of the data items to be deleted, including their ICCP IDs and point
descriptions, shall be sent to the DCTF email distribution list. An updated bilateral table
showing these changes shall also be posted to the ISO ShareFile web portal by this date.
**No new points shall be allowed for deletion in the current year’s cycle after this date. Any**
additional items shall become orphans - meaning that their IDs shall remain on the host
ICCP server, but no longer have live data behind them. Such points shall be indicated in the
bilateral table with “RIP” in the change code field along with the date (in the change date
field) when the points stopped receiving live updates. These “RIP” points shall then become
the starting “DEL” points for the next year.

The months of July and August shall be used for review and coordination. All client sites
shall review the proposed data value deletions. Each client site shall review the information
and coordinate any issues with host sites proposing the deletions. Any required changes
shall be made by the host site in its bilateral table, published to the ISO ShareFile web portal,
and an update notification shall be sent to the DCTF email distribution list.

The months of September and October shall be used for client sites to stop requesting all
data items marked for deletion. In November, the host site shall resend the June 30[ th] list of
points to be deleted, to the DCTF email distribution list, along with a date within the current
year in which they will be removed. Following the removal from their ICCP server, the host
site shall notify the DCTF email distribution list that the work is complete.

B. **Deletion yearly overview**

1. January through May: each site shall identify host data items for deletion in

November/December and change its state to “RIP”.

2. By June 30[ th]: each site shall publish an updated bilateral table and email summary of

“DEL” points to be deleted, to the DCTF email distribution list. All “RIP” points may be
changed to “DEL” at this time.

3. July through August: each client site reviews other host sites’ bilateral tables and

coordinates any issues concerning data item deletions.

4. September through October: each site modifies its data set requests (client’s requests)

by removing the data items marked for current year deletion.

5. November through December: host site resends June 30[ th] list of points to be deleted,

specifying a date when this will occur. After deletion, e-mail confirmation is sent to the
DCTF email distribution list.

**NOTE**

Any and all necessary outages associated with the above work are required to be scheduled
through the normal OP-2 outage process.

**I.OVERVIEW**

The methodology set forth in this Appendix shall be used to establish minimum and
maximum load power factor (LPF) standards for each of the eleven (11) study areas as
defined in OP-17, Appendix A. The New England load levels used for the LPF
standards may be modified by the Voltage Task Force (VTF) from time-to-time, as
system changes dictate. As of 2021, the 2020 LPF standards were composed of five
(5) points:

Maximum standard is composed of three (3) points:

    - 7,000 MW light load

    - 9,000 MW light load

    - 18,000 MW intermediate load biased for high voltage

Minimum standard is composed of two (2) points:

    - 18,000 MW intermediate load biased for low voltage

   - 28,000 MW heavy load

One curve connects the minimum LPF standard points and a second curve connects
the maximum LPF standard points. The two (2) curves represent the upper and lower
boundaries of LPFs that establish the standard for the area. The following figure shows
an example of minimum and maximum LPFs for an area, as a function of load level.

**II.TESTING CRITERIA**

A general criterion is used to determine the minimum and maximum LPFs at each load
level, for all areas.

1. **Minimum/Maximum Voltage**

a. When the study area LPF is at its maximum, a significant number of

transmission busses (69 kV and above) within the study area cannot
exceed the high voltage design criteria of the Transmission Owners
(TOs) in the area.

b. When the study area LPF is at its minimum, a significant number of

transmission busses (69 kV and above) within the study area cannot
drop below the low voltage design criteria of the TOs in the study
area.

c. A “significant number of transmission busses” is to be determined by

the VTF, on a case-by-case basis.

Post-contingency analysis must be performed for the Minimum/Maximum
Voltage test during all lines-in system conditions.

Additionally, for the maximum LPF standard at light load levels, post
Contingency Analysis (CA) must be performed for the most limiting facility out
system condition.

For all load levels, the VTF will determine, based upon a review of results, the
appropriate LPF standard to apply.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

2. **Limiting Criterion for Minimum and Maximum LPF: -**

The LPF standards should not create an overreliance on distribution-installed
reactive devices to maintain acceptable transmission system voltage
performance.

To prevent LPF over-correction:

      - The maximum LPF standard must not fall below unity (i.e., lagging LPF

limit is not allowed)*; and

      - The minimum LPF standard must not fall above unity (i.e., leading LPF

limit is not allowed)

The maximum LPF standard is determined by system performance at light to
intermediate load levels based upon post-contingency high voltage performance.
If the maximum voltage criterion indicates that a lagging (below unity) maximum
LPF standard is needed, this result will be deemed unacceptable. Other
transmission solutions (e.g., transmission reactors) should be investigated.

The minimum LPF standard is determined by system performance at
intermediate to peak load levels based upon post-contingency low voltage
performance. If the minimum voltage criterion indicates that a leading (above
unity) minimum LPF standard is needed, this result will be deemed
unacceptable. Other transmission solutions (e.g., transmission capacitors)
should be investigated.

See Figures 2.1 and 2.2 below for examples of acceptable and unacceptable LPF
standards.

Figure 2.1 notes an example of acceptable LPF standards, in part, because neither
curve crosses unity LPF.

Figure 2.2 documents an example of unacceptable LPF curves for both the minimum
and maximum LPF standards. Both curves cross the unity LPF line. These results
indicate a reliance on distribution-installed reactive devices to maintain acceptable
transmission system voltage performance (i.e., capacitors to support low voltage
concerns and reactors to support high voltage concerns).

*Boston LPF area is the one area that is exempted from the maximum standard limiting
criterion. This is due to the abundance of cables in Boston, which necessitated planning
for a lagging LPF.

**III.LPF DEVELOPMENT**

**1. New England Load Levels to be Modeled**

a. Heavy Net Load (28,000 MW)

b. Intermediate Net Load (18,000 MW)

c. Light Net Load (7,000 MW)

**NOTE**

New England load will be calculated as follows:

New England area Load +

New England area Losses –

New England area Station Service Load.

Pump Storage units will not be included in the calculation of New England load level
for the purposes of these load power factor studies.

**2. LPF Area Definition**

Each LPF area shall be modeled according to the definition in, Operating
Procedure No. 17 – Load Power Factor and System Assessment Appendix A –
Area Definitions (OP-17A). Should new transmission projects introduce a
change along the existing LPF area boundaries, OP-17A shall be promptly
updated to reflect the area definitions used in the current study.

**3. Load Data**

a. MW loads at each bus are to be initialized using ISO projections for the

appropriate net load level. MW load values contained in New England
Library LPF cases are typically suitable. These will reflect appropriately
applied PV and energy efficiency impacts for the studied conditions.

b. MW loads at each bus are to be scaled to the appropriate net load level (i.e.

28,000 MW, 18,000 MW or 7,000 MW).

c. Loads are independent of voltage [constant Power/Reactive (PQ)

representation].

**4. Generator Data and Dispatch**

a. For each load level, Generators are to be dispatched economically in the

base cases, assuming all New England Generators are available and
respecting reserve requirements.

**5. Capacitors/Reactors**

All sub-transmission/distribution capacitors and reactors (below 69 kV) are to be
considered as part of the study area load.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

**6. Tie-Lines**

a. Inter-Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA)

Interface transfers should be tested up to transfer limits where appropriate.

b. HVDC Tie-Lines should be treated like Generators/Demand, and dispatched

accordingly.

**7. Solution Parameters for Contingency Testing**

a. Automatic load tap changing is allowed on all tests.

b. Phase Angle Regulators (PARs) are allowed to regulate flow.

c. The system swing bus is located outside of New England with no regulation

of RCA/BAA interchange flows.

**8. LPF Measurement**

The LPF must be measured at the transmission level (i.e., at the high side of the
transmission step down transformers), typically the 115 kV or 69 kV bus.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

**IV.CONTINGENCIES TO BE TESTED**

The VTF will determine the list of contingencies to be tested for each area’s LPF
standard study. All normal contingencies, as defined in ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19), may be selected for the LPF
study. The OP-19 contingencies consist of individual transmission facilities (i.e.,
transmission lines, transformers, generators), as well as contingencies that result in the
loss of multiple transmission facilities (i.e., Breaker Failure and Double Circuit Tower
Contingencies) that have unacceptable inter-RCA/BAA impact.

If a contingency would knowingly trigger a Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or
Automatic Control Scheme (ACS), then the RAS and ACS actions are to be modeled in
a contingency definition.

**V.TESTING PROCEDURE**

LPFs for these tests are developed from the guidelines described in Section III of this
document (“LPF Development”). Testing focuses on only one study area, at one load
level, at a time. To develop a minimum LPF standard for a given load level, the
loadflow case is biased toward low voltage conditions. To develop a maximum LPF
standard for a given load level, the loadflow case is biased toward high voltage
conditions.

As the LPF is varied in an attempt to find the LPF standard, a uniform LPF must be
applied (i.e., the same LPF must be applied to each bus in the study area).

**A. MINIMUM LPF - The minimum LPF** for each load level is determined as follows.

**1. Low Voltage Bias - Starting from an economic dispatch, generation should be**

biased toward low voltage conditions:

a. **Import Study Areas - In study areas where less economical generation**

exists in comparison with the load (i.e. “Import Study Areas”), the base cases
should be biased for low voltage as follows:

1) Shut off the Generator with largest net VAr producing capability (unless

such Generator is required to run for reliability reasons), within subject
area.

2) Adjust New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to depress

transmission voltages within study area. Interface transfers that tend to
depress study area voltages are to be dispatched up to or near existing
limits, depending on the practicality of dispatch and operations at each
load level.  This could involve dispatching up to existing import limits for
Import Interfaces (e.g., Boston Import), and/or dispatching up to existing
limits for through-flow Interfaces (e.g., North-South). The preference
when changing interface transfers is to fully shut off generators as
opposed to partially lowering output. This minimizes the availability of
available MVAR sources.

b. **Export Study Areas - In study areas where more economical generation**

exists in comparison with the load (i.e., “Export Study Areas”), the base cases
should be biased for low voltage as follows:

1) Adjust New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to depress

transmission voltages within study area. This usually involves
dispatching to existing export limits for the study area.

Interface transfers that tend to depress study area voltages are to be
dispatched up to or near existing limits, depending on the practicality of
dispatch and operations at each load level.

**2. Reactive Dispatch - For each load level, VAr support from all area generation**

and transmission VAr sources is to be maximized:

a. Turn on all Transmission VAr sources (e.g., Capacitor banks, STATCOMs,

etc.) in the area (subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all
busses, as well as other constraints, e.g., Phase II filter requirements,
dynamic reserve requirement for STATCOMs, etc.).

b. Shut off all Transmission VAr absorption facilities (e.g., Reactors, etc.) in the

study area (subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all busses, as
well as other constraints, e.g., Phase II filter requirements, dynamic reserve
requirement for STATCOMs, etc.).

c. Set voltage schedules of all study area Generators to the normal schedule.

The general approach, when determining the minimum LPF standard, is to use
as much generation and transmission VAr support in the area as possible.

**3. Voltage Criteria Testing - For each load level, the minimum LPF standard**

based on voltage criteria is to be determined as follows:

a. Determine the contingency that results in the lowest transmission voltages in

the study area

b. Adjust the study area LPF until a significant number of transmission busses

(69 kV and above) do not drop below the design criteria of TOs in the study
area. This LPF constitutes the minimum LPF for the study area based on
voltage criteria.

**B. MAXIMUM LPF - The maximum LPF** for each load level is determined as follows.

**1. High Voltage Bias - Starting from an economic dispatch, generation should be**

biased toward high voltage conditions as follows (for either export or import study
areas):

a. Shut off the Generator with largest net VAr absorbing capability (unless such

Generator is required to run for reliability reasons), within the study area.

b. Adjust the New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to inflate

transmission voltages within subject area. This entails a dispatch that
minimizes I[2]X losses in the subject area.

**2. Reactive Dispatch - For each load level, VAr absorption capability from all area**

generation and transmission VAr facilities is to be maximized:

a. Shut off all transmission VAr sources (e.g., capacitors, etc.) in area (subject

to minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all busses, as well as other
constraints (e.g., Phase II filter requirements, dynamic reserve requirement
for STATCOMs, etc.).

b. Turn on all transmission VAr absorption facilities (e.g., reactors, STATCOMs,

etc.) in the area [subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedules at all

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

busses, as well as other constraints (e.g., Phase II filter requirements,
dynamic reserve requirements for STATCOMs, etc.)].

c. Set the voltage schedules of all study area Generators to the normal

schedule.

The general approach, when determining the maximum LPF standard, is to use as
much generation and transmission VAr absorption capability in the study area as
possible.

**3. Voltage Criteria Testing - For each load level, the maximum LPF based on**

voltage criteria is to be determined as follows:

a. Determine contingency that results in the highest transmission voltages in the

study area.

b. Adjust the study area LPF until a significant number of transmission busses

(69 kV and above) do not exceed the design criteria of TOs in the study area.
This LPF constitutes the maximum LPF for the study area based on voltage
criteria.

**VI.STUDY SUMMARY**

A study summary shall be written to document all analysis conducted to determine the
LPF standard. The study summary is specific to a LPF study area, load level, and a
maximum or minimum standard. For example, there would be one study summary for
SEMA 7GW maximum point, and another study summary for SEMA 18GW minimum
point. The study summary shall include the following:

    - The new LPF standard

     - List of contingencies evaluated. Indication of the worst contingency.

     - For the maximum standard, light load study, list the facility out conditions

studied.

     - Location of violating bus(es)

    - Base Case Summaries for all load levels studied:

1) MW and MVAr output of all major Generators in the studied LPF. Specify

which Generator was deemed the largest MVAR source and therefore set
offline for the study.

2) Interface flows (MW) for all transmission interfaces relevant to the studied

LPF area.

3) The New England RCA/BAA load (MW)

4) HVDC Transfer Levels (MW)

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes the ranges of acceptable load power factor
(LPF) for various areas within the New England Control Area, and the responsibilities
of the ISO, Transmission Owners (TOs) and Transmission Customers in New England
with respect to LPFs. It also describes the analysis that ISO undertakes to monitor,
assess and report on LPF compliance

A. Overview

ISO is responsible for operating all transmission facilities rated 115 kV and above.
Local Control Centers (LCCs) are responsible for operating all transmission facilities
rated 69 kV and below. To maintain a reliable system, ISO and the LCCs manage the
pre-contingent voltage profile of the New England Transmission System[1] and the
system’s reactive power Resources to meet reactive power demands. Managing the
reactive power output of energy Resources as well any dynamic and shunt reactive
power elements connected to the transmission system helps supply the system’s
reactive losses and the reactive demand of load served by the system.

One key contributing factor to system voltage is the reactive demand of system load.
The reactive demand component of load is often described in terms of LPF. The LPF
is, in simple terms, the ratio of real power demand (MW) to apparent power (MVA).
LPF is a key study assumption used in long range planning of the transmission system,
and it is a key factor in the operation of the power system. Significant changes in LPF
from that assumed in planning studies can lead to out-of-merit Resource commitments
to prevent unacceptable high or low system voltages, and potential reliability concerns,
when operating the system.

B. Responsibilities

ISO monitors the LPF throughout the New England Transmission System by surveying
portions of the system defined as LPF Areas in Appendix A – Area Definitions. Those
Areas where LPF is not within defined acceptable LPF ranges (which are defined by
the LPF used in planning or that defined by operating analyses), and/or where an
Operating Issue exists, shall implement the actions listed in Part I(C)(1-2).

For purposes of this OP, the term “Operating Issue” is defined as an actual or near
voltage limit exceedance condition that requires any of the following mitigating actions:

     - Deviating from economic dispatch,

     - Switching out a cable,

     - Purchase of available emergency capacity or energy,

     - Shedding load

1 The New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO New England Inc.
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and includes the Reliability
Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA), Bulk Electric System (BES) and
NPCC bulk power system (BPS) elements found within New England on the transmission
network.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

   - Actions that go beyond what is established by current Transmission Operating

Guides (TOGs)

For example, additional commitment of generators to control a post-contingent high
voltage limit exceedance due to a change in LPF is deemed an Operating Issue due to
the exceedance’s impact on the system’s ability to accommodate the limiting system
condition / topology as well as the availability of generation to mitigate the voltage limit
exceedance.

C. Compliance Actions

1. Non-compliance with LPF Standard

For each LPF area that violates its standard(s), a letter will be sent to all TLC
Contacts (s) within the LPF area by the end of the year following the survey year.
For example, in 2022, the year 2021 is being surveyed, and by the end of 2022, a
letter regarding the 2021 survey results will be sent.

In the letter, TLC(s) within the violating LPF area are encouraged to evaluate their
LPF performance, and if they in fact violated the LPF standard, to take mitigating
actions to improve LPF performance. However, the TLC is not responsible for
providing the analysis or mitigating plan to ISO. Since the LPF survey aggregates
the performance of all load serving transformers within an LPF area, it is possible
that an individual TLC operated within the LPF standards, yet exists within an LPF
area that, as a whole, violated the standard(s).

In the letter, several hours of poor performance will be identified. The poor
performance hours do not represent the extent of the problem within the violating
LPF area; rather, the poor performance hours provide a potential starting point or
focus point for the TLCs’ investigation. It is possible that the TLC was in fact
compliant during the identified poor performance hour and yet not compliant during
another hour that was not identified. Ultimately, the responsibility of assessing an
individual TLC’s LPF performance lies with that TLC. The poor performance hours
identified by ISO on the LPF letters will represent 10 unique days of the highest
MVAR surplus or deficiency. The hour of the highest MVAR surplus or deficiency
of that day will also be identified. Therefore, the hours identified may not be the top
10 hours for highest surplus or deficiency. For example, if one day contains the
three highest surplus hours for the year, only the highest surplus hour of that day
will be listed on the letter.

2. Operating Issue

The ISO shall conduct the initial review of any Operating Issue and depending on the
results of that technical review shall:

  - Share any correlation of new system voltage Operating Issues and LPF with the

Voltage Task Force (VTF);

  - Review trends with the VTF and any appropriate entities and recommend

corrective actions;

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

     - Review trends with Master / Local Control Center Heads and Reliability

Committee when appropriate

The timeline and actions applicable when an Operating Issue is identified are as
follows:

     - ISO shall send a request to the LCC to confirm the Transmission Load

Customers (TLC) and Transmission Load Customer Contacts (TLC Contacts)
as recorded in Appendix C – Instructions for the ISO New England Load Power
Factor Survey (OP-17C) in a non-compliant area, within seven (7) Business
Days of the event identification.

     - The LCC shall confirm / correct the list of TLCs and TLC Contacts in the non
compliant area within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of the list.

     - ISO shall request additional data from the TLC Contact(s) to determine the

entities involved in the actual or near miss Operating Issue within seven (7)
Business Days of receipt of LCC confirmation. As described in OP-17C, the
TLC Contact is expected to forward the data requests to their associated TLCs
as indicated in OP-17C Table 1.

     - The TLC shall send requested data regarding LPF operation to ISO System

Operations for the identified dates and times by no later than fourteen (14)
Business Days of the data request. If the TLC believes the requested data is
voluminous and requires additional time to collect, it can request additional time
from the ISO.

     - ISO shall review the TLC’s LPF data. If review and analysis of the TLC LPF

data demonstrates that the TLC contributed to the Operating Issue, then ISO
will send a notification of non-compliance to the responsible TLC.  The
notification of non-compliance will be send to the TLC within fourteen (14)
Business Days of the TLC’s data submittal to ISO Operations.

     - Responsible TLCs shall submit to the ISO an action plan within forty (40)

Business Days of receipt of a non-compliance notification. The mitigation plan
shall include an expected date of a return-to-compliance based upon completion
of the action plan.

     - Responsible TLCs shall submit evidence of implementing the action plan to

return-to-compliance, to ISO within forty (40) Business Days of submitting the
action plan, as well as when the action plan is complete.

**II.** **LPF REQUIREMENT**

The ranges of acceptable LPFs within the New England Control Area (described in
Appendix A – Area Definitions) are portrayed as bandwidths of LPF expressed as a
function of system load level. For a specific system load level (see Figure 1), the

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

bandwidth between a pair of limiting curves represents the range of acceptable LPFs.

  - These ranges are determined by ISO, in coordination with the TOs, for planning

and system design studies.



  - These ranges are determined by ISO, in consultation with the VTF, for Real
Time operations, when LPF curve updates are warranted based on major
system changes such as installation of major transmission projects, generation
additions or retirements, or installation of new significant reactive power
Resources.

Appendix B – Methodology for Developing Load Power Factor Standards - contains the
study methodology used in Operations for developing the ranges of acceptable LPFs.


If the ISO determines that the LPF acceptable ranges require updating, loadflow
analysis shall be conducted by the ISO and VTF at a maximum of three distinct load
levels. These load levels may be modified as system demand dictates.

The TO and Transmission Customer have the responsibility to manage the LPF of all
connected distribution loads, and may do so by switching in-or-out-of-service,
transmission and distribution reactive Resources to meet the LPF Area’s voltage needs
and, ultimately, LPF requirements.

Generators connected to the power transmission system and sub-transmission system
shall comply with the voltage schedules in OP-12B (as applicable), or as established
by the local TO, and operate all units with AVRs in-service, in automatic and regulating
to a voltage schedule unless the units are:

**III.** **LPF SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE AND EVALUATION**

A. LPF Survey

The ISO shall conduct a survey of all LPF areas annually or more frequently as
circumstances may dictate. If the LPF survey shows a significant amount of LPF
points outside the established LPF curves during the surveyed period, the ISO may
request additional data from TOs or Transmission Customers to determine the
responsible entity or entities causing the area’s non-compliance, within a reasonable
and agreed upon timeframe. Further actions will be taken by the ISO as described in
Section 1 of this OP.

The ISO is responsible for collecting the data, sharing the data with the VTF and, if
necessary, requesting additional data from TOs and/or Transmission Customers to
complete this analysis. The TOs and Transmission Customers are required to
provide the requested data to the ISO within the timeframes noted within this
procedure.

The ISO shall perform the LPF survey and calculate the LPF at the transmission
level, evaluate the LPF compliance, review trends and share the results with the
VTF, M/LCC Heads and Reliability Committee. The TOs and Transmission
Customers are responsible for reviewing the LPF survey results on an area basis for
their load and shall provide additional data if requested by the ISO, to determine the
load entity or entities that were non-compliant. The Transmission Customers are
responsible for developing corrective actions when required.

The information gained from performing the LPF survey, if appropriate, may then be
used by the ISO to create and update system models for conducting system studies
and creating new operating voltage guides, as appropriate.

B. LPF Assessment or Reliability Review

Changes in the system or perceived changes in system performance will necessitate
a review and potential revision to one or more LPF’s requirements for the LPF Areas.
The ISO and LCC’s VTF members (as needed) shall conduct studies based on the
methodology described in Appendix B of this OP. Any resulting change in the LPF
standards will then be used for any succeeding LPF assessments.

The LPF standard is defined as a boundary, normally defined as a line or curve,
where acceptable system performance occurs for LPF and load level combinations.
The area on one side of the curve yields unacceptable performance while the other
side yields acceptable performance. The LPF standard, or curves, shall be
established using pre or post-contingent voltage limits to establish where the limiting
curve point exists for defined test system load levels and sets of system conditions.
For example, in Figure 1 above, the area below the red curve and above the blue
curve would yield combinations of LPF and system load where reliable operation with
respect to voltage limit should be able to occur (for all lines in-service and specific
facility out conditions). The area above the red curve and below the blue curve
should result in either potential high or low post-contingent system operation,
respectively.

LPF assessments determine the level of shunt compensation required to return the

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

area in question to LPF compliance. The assessment determines the change in
shunt capacitance, or reactance, to return the area’s LPF to within the defining
curves for a low voltage, or high voltage, exceedance, respectively. These shunt
compensation levels are reasonable estimates of the net relative change in area
power factor that would need to occur to return the area to LPF compliance.

When an Operating Issue is identified, the ISO shall perform a reliability review. For
the reliability review, if the LPF assessment shows that actual or near voltage limit
exceedances from the system are strongly correlated with the LPF Area’s
performance, the results will then be compared against the area’s existing LPF
standards to determine the amount of LPF correction needed to improve reliability.
The ISO, after consultation with the VTF, shall determine the amount of shunt
capacitors or reactors needed to improve reliability. If the ISO determines that a new
LPF standard is needed for any of the LPF Areas due to an Operating Issue, the VTF
shall develop the new standard and share the new requirements through the annual
report on LPF.

The ISO shall annually provide a report to the M/LCC Heads and Reliability
Committee on LPF compliance by LPF Area, highlight future reactive targets and any
Operating Issue created by the LPF performance. The report shall also include a
summary of the LPF survey, assessment or reliability review and list the noncompliance notifications issued by the ISO, either due to general area LPF noncompliance or for Operating Issues impacted by poor LPF as described in Part 1,
above. Any new LPF standards developed for any of the LPF areas shall be updated
and shared with the Transmission Customers and TOs to provide the area’s LPF
requirements.

This OP is intended to complement other ISO New England Operating Procedures
and ensure reliable operation of the transmission system. This OP also directly
supports the goals of ISO New England Operating Procedure No.19 Transmission Operation (OP-19), which prescribes criteria for the reliable
operation of the transmission system including voltage and reactive limitations and
contingencies.

**I.** **PURPOSE**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes standards for metering (measurement) and
telemetering (data transmission) for the purposes of ISO New England (ISO) dispatching,
market settlement, Transmission Owner (TO), Local Control Centers (LCCs) and Market
Participant (MP) peak load determination, factors that impact voting shares and load power
factor (lpf) measurement. This OP identifies the power system parameters that each TO and
MP are to meter and/or telemeter. This OP also establishes standards to verify that the
equipment that each TO or MP installs can provide an appropriate level of accuracy and/or
appropriate recordings for audit purposes. This OP further prescribes maintenance
procedures and schedules to be followed by each TO and MP so that the attainable level of
accuracy may be realized.

There may be additional metering and telemetering requirements established by local state
utility control and distribution utilities.

**II.** **ACRONYMS & DEFINITIONS**

ISO CFE: Market Participant Communications Front End

CNP: Communication Network Processor

Fiducial Value: A value to which reference is made in order to specify the accuracy of a
transducer. The Fiducial Value is the span except for transducers having a symmetrical
reversible input and output. In this case, the Fiducial Value is half the span. (Reference:
ANSI/IEEE 460-1988, lapsed) Examples below:

`o` Above the term “symmetrical reversible” means that the positive and negative full scale

are equal in magnitude while opposite in polarity and halfway in the span is zero (0).

`o` An AC Watt and/or VAr transducer where the inputs (voltage and current) are

bidirectional (due to their nature of being ac) and where the values Watts and VArs that
would be derived from them based upon magnitude and angle difference are also
bidirectional would therefore mean the Fiducial Value half span (the value of positive full
scale). Given an example scale of -810 MW to 0 to +810 MW and an absolute error of 7
MW would yield a % error of 0.86% (7 MW / 810 MW) meaning the Fiducial Value would
be 810 MW.

`o` A transmitter device (such as the RFL 9800 series transmitter) that takes a signal

representing a telemetered MW and outputs a frequency shifted by the input would
have a Fiducial Value of the full span independent of the input since the output is
between a min and max frequency. Given an example input scale of -300 MW to 0 to
+300 MW via a -5V to 0 to +5V input signal and the associated output scale being 10 Hz
to 20 Hz to 30 Hz, because the output is not reversible the Fiducial Value of the output
is 20 Hz (Span = 30 Hz – 10 Hz). In that example if the absolute error in frequency was
0.5 Hz, the % error would be 2.5% (0.5 Hz / 20 Hz). The receiver would similarly have
its input as not being symmetrically reversible and so the Fiducial Value would be the
full span.

`o` An AC Volt transducer has a symmetrical reversible input due to it being ac but the

output would be unidirectional (zero to full scale) and as such, the Fiducial Value would
be the full span but in that case, the full span is equal to the positive full scale as there
is no negative side to the scale. Therefore, effective accuracy is similar to the Watt/VAr


-----

transducer example where the positive full scale ends up being in the denominator.

GIC: Geomagnetically Induced Current

HVDC: any DC equipment that operates at 100kV or above.

ICCP: Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol

LCC: Local Control Center

Modified: Modified or modify is defined for purposes of this Operating Procedure for new and
Non-Emergency Replacement Equipment. For SCADA substation communications only,
examples of this would include non-emergency changes to NERC Bulk Electric System (BES)
RTUs and expansion of BES substation facilities that include new BES RTU inputs. Periodic
maintenance of RTUs such as software updates would not be considered to be “modified”.

MP: Market Participant

Non-Emergency Replacement Equipment: is any equipment that does not interrupt or alter the
flow of data critical to system operation when it fails and that, as such, does not need to be
returned to service immediately. This equipment has been categorized as maintenance
priorities B and C in Table 1 of Appendix A to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 2
(OP-2A). As provided for in OP-2A, the maintenance priority of any equipment not included in
Table 1 shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the ISO, the LCC, and SCADA TOs.

RTU: Remote Terminal Unit. Field station device to provide or receive telemetry to or from
LCC or SCADA Servers.

SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition

SCADA Server: A server running a SCADA application which communicates with RTU's and
other systems to acquire data required by this OP.

SCADA TO: any LCC or a TO that owns and maintains SCADA Servers, designated by ISO,
as described above. LCCs or SCADA TOs are:

 Central Maine Power (TOP/LCC)
 Eversource (CONVEX, NSTAR and PSNH; TOP/LCC)
 National Grid (REMVEC; TOP/LCC)
 VELCO (TOP/LCC)
 United Illuminating (TO only)
 Versant (TO only)
 Rhode Island Energy (TO, currently National Grid is TOP providing SCADA

servers)

STN (Shared Telecommunications Network): The STN is the network resulting from the


-----

interconnection and sharing of the private telecommunications systems and networks owned
by the TOs.

Telemetering (telemetry): Transmission of measurable quantities using telecommunication
techniques. (reference: IEEE 610.2-1987, including analog and digital below)

`o` **Analog - Telemetering in which some characteristic of the transmitter signal is**

proportional to the quantity being measured.

`o` **Digital - Telemetering in which a numerical representation is generated and**

transmitted, the number being representative of the quantity being measured.

Tie-Line Assets: A physical transmission line which connects a TO/MP to another TO/MP, a
non-MP or the 345 kV (or above) Pool Transmission Facility (PTF) system. Tie-Line Assets
are also used to connect different sections of a TO/MP system that is divided by a Load Zone
boundary. This definition supplements that contained in Tariff Section I – General Terms and
Conditions.

TO: Transmission Owner

TOP: Transmission Operator

Transducer: A device that takes a signal or signals (Volts, Amps, etc.,) and converts it into
another signal or signals (milli-Amps, Volts, etc.). Most often used to convert secondary Volts
and/or Amp quantities into a scaled signal usable by an RTU (mA or Volt) representing system
Volts, Amps, Watts, VArs or Frequency values. Digital meters and digital relays that convert
signals into numerical values used for OP-18 compliance will be treated as transducers for this
OP.

Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) should be via the New
England Shared Telecommunications Network.

**B. Instantaneous Megawatts and Megavars**

1. This data shall be telemetered to ISO.

2. This data may also be required by other dispatch centers within either system and by

systems beyond the interconnecting systems.

3. For new interconnections, and any upgrades of existing equipment, currently

supportable telemetering equipment shall be used and quantities shall be transmitted to
each receiver location directly without retransmission (i.e., without an intermediate
receiver and transmitter).

**C. Megawatt-hours per Hour**

1. There shall be a device at each interconnection facility to record the hourly billing watt
hours on site. In all new and upgraded installations, solid-state data recorders shall be
installed.

2. The MWh data shall be telemetered hourly to either ISO or the control center of the

interconnected system. If it is telemetered to ISO, it shall be telemetered via the
applicable LCC or SCADA TO, that has responsibility for the particular interconnection
line.

3. The watt-hour data shall be compensated for line losses to the ISO RCA/BAA boundary.

4. MWh may be recorded and telemetered as a net or as two quantities, MWh IN and

MWh OUT.

**V.** **METERING AND RECORDING FOR SETTLEMENTS**

**A. Overall Requirements**

1. MWh per hour (i.e. energy per hour) data is required for each Generator Asset, Tie-Line

Asset and Load Asset. There is an option for Generator Assets, Tie-Line Assets and
Load Assets, subject to appropriate authorization, to have metering data submitted at
the subhourly 5-minute interval. The 5-minute data reported shall be calculated by
measuring the generation or consumption energy in units of MWh in the 5-minute
interval and multiplying that value by 12 (resulting in an average generation or
consumption in units of MW during the interval). This 5-minute subhourly data reporting
option shall also apply to all other settlement Watt-hour (Wh) and MWh requirements.

2. In order for an Asset to be eligible to participate in one or more of the markets, the

Asset shall have Wh metering as defined in this OP. The exception to this is in the case
of intra-MP Tie-Line Assets as defined in Section V.D.2 of this OP.

3. For Demand Response Resources (DRR), MWh per 5-minute interval data is required

for each Demand Response Asset (DRA). The 5-minute data reported shall be
calculated by measuring the consumption or generation in the 5-minute interval and


-----

multiplying that value by 12 (resulting in an effective hourly consumption or generation).
In order for a DRA to be eligible to participate in one or more of the markets, the DRA
shall have a Wh metering or recording device as defined in this OP.

**B. Wh Metering and MWh per Hour Data**

1. New and upgraded Wh metering installations shall conform to the requirements in

Section VIII of this OP.

2. The hourly MWh per hour data shall be submitted to ISO in accordance with ISO New

England Manual for Market Rule 1 Accounting Manual M-28 (Manual M-28).

3. For Tie-Line Assets: the hourly MWh per hour data may be recorded for a given Asset

as two quantities, MWh IN and MWh OUT, but shall be submitted to ISO as a net
quantity.

4. The MWh per hour data quantities shall be automatically recorded at no greater than an

hourly interval in accordance with Section VIII.B.5 of this OP. If the option for submitting
5-minute interval data is used, the quantities shall be automatically recorded at no
greater than the 5-minute interval.

5. Wh meters shall be equipped with kilowatt-hour (kWh) or MWh registers which shall be

read a minimum of once a month. The purpose of this register read is to validate hourly
data and allow for an adjustment, which corrects the sum of the hourly readings
submitted to ISO during the month to the total energy actually metered. (See section
X.D.7 for required energy comparison)

6. The location of applicable Wh metering shall comply with this OP and be reported to

ISO by the responsible MP.

7. The hourly MWh per hour data or subhourly data shall be reported to ISO to reflect the

Asset at the Interconnection Point. For purposes of this OP, the Interconnection Point is
hereafter defined as:

i. the PTF boundary;

ii. the agreed upon point of interconnection between two TOs/MPs; or

iii. the agreed upon point of interconnection between a TO/MP and a non-MP.

Wh meters not located at the Interconnection Point shall be compensated for losses to
the Interconnection Point as follows:

a) Level I accuracy

Wh metering that is:

     - physically located at the Interconnection Point, or

     - **not physically located at the Interconnection Point but continuously compensated**

within the Wh meter or Wh metering circuit for excitation and load losses to the
Interconnection Point.

b) Level II accuracy

Wh metering that complies with this OP, except that it is not physically located at the
Interconnection Point, but the recorded meter data is compensated through external
calculations for excitation and load losses to the Interconnection Point. The
integration interval for the loss compensation calculations shall not exceed a onehour period, Compensation calculations shall be based on both real power (kW) and


-----

reactive power (kVAr or kQ) measurements. Voltage may be either measured or
assumed constant.

c) Level III accuracy

Existing Wh metering without reactive recording capability that complies with this
OP, and is not physically located at the Interconnection Point, may have its MWh
recorded meter data compensated through external calculations for excitation and
load losses to the Interconnection Point. In such cases, the compensation
calculations shall be based on real power (kW) measurements, a fixed 95% power
factor, and voltage may be either measured or assumed constant. The integration
interval for the loss compensation calculations shall not exceed a one-hour period.

8. For DRAs, the 5-minute (MWh) data submitted to the ISO in accordance with Manual M
28 shall be either energy billing quality as defined in OP-18, Appendix C - Minimum
Accuracy Standards For New And Upgraded Metering, Recording And Telemetering
Installations And For Calibration Of Existing Equipment (OP-18C) or in the case where
metering is installed specifically for the DRA (and will not be used for utility billing
purposes), a metering system with an overall accuracy as defined in OP-18C may be
used. Metering used for utility billing purposes is also known as revenue quality
metering.

9. DC coupled Assets participating in one or more of the markets separately must meet

the following requirements:

a) DC Wh metering must be installed for each Asset.
b) AC Wh metering compliant with this OP must be installed at or compensated to

the Interconnection Point.

c) Reported interval MWh per hour values for each DC coupled Asset must sum to

the measured AC MWh per hour compensated to the Interconnection Point in
each interval.

d) Both unadjusted DC MWh per hour values and reported interval MWh per hour

values for each DC coupled Asset shall be made available to all Lead MPs for
the Assets prior to reporting to ISO.

**C. Generator Assets**

1. Generator Assets directly connected to the 345 kV (or above) PTF system shall be

metered at the PTF boundary or compensated to the PTF boundary in accordance with
Section V.B of this OP.

2. Generator Assets directly connected to the PTF system at 230 kV or below where PTF

boundary metering is used shall be metered at the PTF boundary or compensated to
the PTF boundary in accordance with Section V.B of this OP.

3. Generator Assets directly connected to the PTF system at 230 kV or below where PTF

boundary metering is not used shall be metered at:

(i) the generator terminals in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Interconnection Agreement,

(ii) at the PTF boundary; or

(iii) compensated to the PTF boundary in accordance with Section V.B of this
OP.


-----

4. Generator Assets not connected to the PTF system shall be metered at the

Interconnection Point or compensated to the Interconnection Point in accordance with
Section V.B of this OP. The Interconnection Point shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Interconnection Agreement.

**D. Tie-Line Assets**

1. Tie-Line Assets shall have a Wh meter or in the case of intra-TO/MP tie-lines an

instantaneous watt meter to calculate Wh at the Interconnection Point or compensated
to the Interconnection Point with the other TO/MP or non-MP unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties involved or the PTF boundary as appropriate and in accordance with
Section V.B of this OP.

2. Intra-TO/MP tie-lines are Tie-Line Assets used to connect different sections of a TO/MP

system that is divided by a Load Zone boundary. For these Tie-Line Assets, MWh per
hour data derived from integrating instantaneous MW data used for Dispatch purposes
(Section VI.) is acceptable provided the metering equipment meets the minimum
accuracy standards defined in OP-18C.

**E. Load Assets**

1. Every Load Asset except DRAs shall have a Wh meter or be determined on an hourly

basis as an allocation of Wh meters. The Wh meter shall be located either at the
Interconnection Point or compensated to the Interconnection Point in accordance with
Section V.B of this OP.

2. The load that is measured by a TO/MP Load Asset metering system may include PTF

losses. If the Load Asset metering system includes such PTF losses, these losses, as
determined by the ISO State Estimator (SE) in accordance with the procedures
embodied in Manual M-28, shall be supplied to the TO/MP by ISO, and shall be
subtracted from the total load as metered, to determine a TO/MP non-PTF demand.

**VI.** **INTERNAL NEW ENGLAND METERING AND TELEMETERING FOR DISPATCH, MARKET,**
**AND RELIABILITY PURPOSES**

**A. Generator Asset, Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (ATRR) and Load**

**Telemetering Criteria**

a) Generator Asset Net MW, and Net MVAr, as measured at the low-side of the GSU

transformer. Refer to OP-18D for definition of Net. Combined cycle plants are
required to supply measurements for each unit.

b) Automatic voltage regulation (AVR) indicator, which indicates whether the unit(s)

and/or flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) device(s) is/are in
automatic voltage regulating mode and regulating voltage. This includes AVR status
for individual generators or synchronous condensers, which are part of a composite
Asset, except for wind plants which are described in i. below.

i. For a wind plant, the AVR status indicates the combined status of all the

various pieces of equipment that make up the voltage regulation system. That
equipment may include Dynamic Volt-Amp Reactive (D-VAr) devices, capacitor
banks, master control computers, breakers, Static VAR Compensators (SVCs),
FACTS, Remedial Action Schemes (RAS) or Automatic Control Schemes
(ACS) equipment, or any other equipment that contributes to the functioning of
the full specified voltage regulation capability. If any of these contributing
pieces of equipment are degraded or out-of-service then the AVR status
indicator shall indicate “OFF”.

c) Power system stabilizer status shall be provided if installed.

d) MW and MVAr station service load values may also be requested.

e) Generator Asset terminal voltage measurements may also be requested.

f) Other telemetered data needed for ISO BPS monitoring and operation based on how

ISO models the Asset shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. The
determination of the data that shall be telemetered shall be made jointly by ISO, the
LCC or SCADA TO.

g) ISO may waive requirements in this section based on how ISO models the Asset.

ISO shall document exemption process requests on behalf of the TO and/or MP for
any waived requirements.

**B. Transmission System Telemetering Criteria**

The following quantities shall be telemetered. Any major change to modify an existing
facility shall conform to the procedures set forth below.


-----

1. Transmission substation voltage from the following:

a) Each generating station 50 MW or larger that connects to the 69 kV and above

transmission system.

b) Each 115 kV and above substation where two (2) or more line sections terminate

with protective circuit interruption capability, such as a circuit breaker.

**NOTE**

The preferred measurement of bus voltage is phase-phase. In the event that
phase-phase measurement is not provided, a phase-phase value calculated
from a phase-ground measurement is acceptable.

2. Substation frequency from the following:

a) Each station that either:

(i) has a Designated Blackstart Resource OR

(ii) has generation capability that is 50 MW or larger (nameplate).

b) Each 230 kV and above substation.

c) Each 115 kV substation where two or more line sections terminate with protective

circuit interruption capability, such as a circuit breaker.

d) Transmission substations not providing frequency data identified in each TO’s list

submitted to ISO on October 1, 2020 shall be exempt from meeting the requirements
of this Section VI.B.2. Transmission substations that already provide substation
frequency and are therefore not included in a TO’s list shall continue to provide
substation frequency as required under this Section VI.B.2. For any new
transmission substations, a TO may request an exemption pursuant to Section III.C
of this OP. ISO may require that a transmission substation included in a TO’s
exemption list meet the requirements of Section VI.B.2 if a reliability need for the
data from that transmission substation arises.

3. MW and MVAr from each terminal of all non-radial inter-LCC lines.

4. MW and MVAr from every terminal of all 230 kV and above lines and at least one end of

each non-radial 115 kV line.

5. MW and MVAr from each transformer connected to 115 kV and above.

6. MW and MVAr from one end of each intra-LCC line that is necessary for reliable

transmission operation, to support BPS transfers, or is otherwise needed.

7. The status of each breaker 115 kV and above.

8. Any transformer with voltage regulation capability that has a low-side voltage of 115 kV

or above shall provide the status of its voltage regulating state. This is commonly
referenced as a load tap changer (LTC) AVR status.

9. The on-load tap changer (OLTC) tap positions of each autotransformer connected to

230 kV and above and each phase-shifting transformer connected to 115 kV and above.

10. Other telemetered data needed for ISO BPS operation (i.e., synchronous condensers,

HVdc terminals, SVC, capacitor/reactor status, frequency, FACTS devices, RAS and
ACS equipment and selected 69 kV switching devices) shall be determined on a case

-----

by-case basis. The determination of the data that shall be telemetered shall be made
jointly by ISO, the LCC/SCADA TO and the MP.

11. GIC in ANDC from each transformer subject to the requirements of Section 3.12 of

PP11. The measured GIC value shall have the following direction convention: a
positive sign shall indicate the GIC flows from ground into the transformer neutral, and a
negative sign shall indicate the GIC flows from the transformer neutral into ground.

**C. Telemetered Data Scan Rates**

The following minimum standards are established for the frequency at which telemetered
quantities shall be scanned and made available to the local ICCP server or ISO CFE.

Frequency of Scanning (Seconds)

1. The data required for tie line MW, tie line MVAr, substation frequency, and Automatic

Generation Control (AGC) operation, which includes unit MW for AGC generators and
ATRR Regulation Service providers, shall be made available to the local ICCP server or
ISO CFE within four (4) seconds. This time interval is measured as the time the data is
scanned at the RTU until the time the data is received at the local ICCP server or ISO
CFE.

2. The analog power system data, which includes all other analog data defined in Section

VI of this OP, shall be made available to the local ICCP server or ISO CFE within ten
(10) seconds of a change in data at a RTU. For all DRAs, data shall be submitted in 5minute intervals. For a DRR to provide TMSR or TMNSR, DRA telemetry values shall
be submitted at a minimum of every one minute. This data requirement recognizes that
the change detection logic employed by some RTUs is telemetered to the SCADA
system only after a change in the data is detected by the RTU, and that the amount of
change may be different for each point in an RTU.

3. Telemetered status data shall be made available to the local ICCP server or ISO CFE

within four (4) seconds of a change reported by an RTU.

**D. Telemetered Data Criteria**

The following communication paths shall be established to make the required telemetered
data available. Some paths are dependent upon the Asset being defined as dispatchable
per OP-14.

1. Generation data (Section VI.A) shall be made available to the LCC or SCADA TO in

which the Asset resides. The LCCs and SCADA TOs shall make this data available to
the ICCP network.

a. If the Asset is dispatchable, the generation data shall also be made available to ISO

via the ISO CFE (see OP-18, Appendix F - ISO Communications Front End (CFE)
Interface Specifications (OP-18F). Some dispatchable types have additional data
requirements as specified in OP-14 that shall also be provided to ISO. ISO shall
make all of this data available to the ICCP network.

b. If the Asset is dispatchable and the Asset nameplate generation capability as

defined by the NX-12 technical data is less than 15 MW, then the LCC or SCADA
TO may request an exemption to providing this data. The LCC or SCADA TO shall
submit the exemption request to ISO and provide a technical explanation as to why
the data cannot be obtained. ISO, at its sole discretion, shall grant or deny the
exemption.


-----

2. Transmission system data described in Section VI.B of this OP shall be made available

by the LCC or SCADA TO to the ICCP network. This data shall also be made available
to the ISO via the ISO CFE if the Designated Entity (DE) owns the transmission system
equipment and the Asset is defined as dispatchable per OP-14.

3. The following Asset types from Section VI.A shall connect directly to ISO per

OP-18F, or OP-18G, as applicable, to supply data:

a. DARDs

b. ATRRs

c. DRAs

4. OP-18 Appendix A - ISO New England ICCP Server Node Requirement (OP-18A)

defines the binary representation expected for status data types.

**E. Local Control Center and SCADA TO Configuration of SCADA Servers**

1. At a minimum, each LCC or SCADA TO shall provide at least one SCADA server at two

separate locations at least one mile apart and each must utilize servers connected to
the ICCP Network (including STN). Connections to the STN must be approved by the
STN Management Committee. LCCs and SCADA TOs shall configure SCADA Servers
to ensure that one is enabled and another provides equivalent standby capability.

2. Station RTU inputs to SCADA Servers for BES transmission facilities or Generation

facilities with 20MVA and above nameplate capacity shall use at least two different
transports for communication as in the below examples unless otherwise approved by
ISO:

     - Utility fiber via physical path A

     - Commercial technology A by vendor 1

     - Utility fiber via physical path B

     - Commercial technology B by vendor 2

     - Utility technology X

3. Station RTU inputs to SCADA Servers for non-BES facilities or Distributed Generation

facilities with less than 20MVA nameplate capacity shall use at least one transport listed
from section VI.E.3.

**NOTE**

The intent of the LCC or SCADA TO providing data to the ICCP network is to ensure
that the only possibility of single points of failure are individual non-redundant field
devices (RTUs). For generation facilities, this also adds redundancy when the LCCs
are performing the TOP function.


-----

Figure 6-1 shows the network redundancy and network configuration that LCCs and
SCADA TOs must provide for all new or existing installations that are Modified.

If an LCC, SCADA TO or Generation Facility uses commercial carriers for leased lines,
then the circuits must be registered with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Cyber Security and Infrastructure Agency (CISA’s) Telecommunications Service Priority
program to ensure prioritized service and restoration, or with a comparable ISO
approved program. Implementation dates are as described above.

If an LCC or SCADA TO uses cellular wireless services, then the service must be public
safety grade wireless such as FirstNet.

This design is for Transmission Owner NERC BES stations along with generation facilities
20 MVA and above and the intent is to eliminate single points of failure for communication
pathways for a single station. Network transport devices that facilitate communications
for more than one station shall also be redundant to eliminate cascading data loss from
multiple stations. Dual RTUs are not necessary to meet the requirement of Figure 6-1.

In Figure 6-1 when referring to “Technology #1” and “Technology #2”, these must use a
different technology medium i.e. wireless 4G and wireless 5G would not be considered
different technology.

**NOTE**

See Appendix A for other details regarding ICCP server requirements and maintenance.

LCCs and SCADA TOs shall have full SCADA Server functional equivalence at each
Control Center location. There shall be no single point of failure that leads to
communication loss for more than one station.

**E. Non-Telemetered Data Criteria**

Additional data may be determined to be necessary for the overall operation of the
ISO/LCC/SCADA TO/TO/MP dispatch computer systems. This data shall originate from,
and be the responsibility of, the dispatch center with jurisdiction over the data. This data
shall be made available for transmission as needed to the ISO/LCC/SCADA TO/TO/MP
dispatch computer systems.

Examples of this type of data include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Generator limits and unit control modes (UCMs);

2. Text messages;

3. Non-telemetered breaker and switching device status;

4. Calculated data including transfer limits and flows, interface limits and flows; and

5. Economic dispatch basepoints/desired generations, and AGC setpoints.

**F. Telemetered Data Identification**

**NOTE**

OP-18F is a confidential document subject to the ISO New England Information
Policy. If access to OP-18F is needed, contact ISO Participant Support and
Solutions as detailed on the ISO external website.

ISO, each LCC/SCADA TO, each TO and each MP shall uniquely and correctly identify the

data being supplied to the network using the format described in OP-18 A for CNP sourced
data and in OP-18F and OP-18G for ISO CFE data.

**VII.** **METERING FOR POWER FACTOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES**

Each TO/MP shall submit to ISO the quantities necessary to calculate TO/MP lpf as prescribed
in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 17 - Load Power Factor and System
Assessment (OP-17). A sufficient number of the necessary quantities shall be metered and
recorded so that the resulting lpf is a valid calculation.

**VIII.** **EQUIPMENT STANDARDS FOR NEW AND UPGRADED INSTALLATIONS**


-----

This section specifies standards for metering, recording and telemetering equipment that each
TO/MP installs in all new and upgraded facilities. A TO/MP may maintain or repair existing
equipment with like or improved components, but each TO/MP shall choose equipment that
meets all the requirements of this OP and Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff when the equipment is
being replaced for purposes other than maintenance or repair (i.e., for purposes of upgrading
the facility).

**A. ANSI Standards**

All AC metering devices used shall conform to applicable American National Standard Institute

(ANSI) C-12 standards as amended from time-to-time. HVdc metering devices shall meet
or exceed the following accuracy requirements of ANSI standards as noted below in 1, 2,
and 3.

1. Integrated metering quantities, such as watt-hours and the associated demand

components shall conform to ANSI standard C12.

2. Instruments or transducers for the analog or digital measurement of telemetered

quantities, such as MW, shall conform to ANSI standards C39.1, C39.5 and C37.90.

3. Instrument transformers shall conform to ANSI standard C57.13.

**B. Specific ISO New England Standards**

1. The design accuracy of individual components as well as overall systems shall conform

to the standards contained in OP-18C.

2. Electro-mechanical Wh meters shall not be installed.

3. For all grounded wye system metering, three element meters and transducers shall be

used. For all delta system (ungrounded) metering, two or three element meters and
transducers may be used.

4. The requirement for data recorders and for integrated metering quantities shall be

satisfied with the types of equipment listed below. Either type may be used internally or
on interconnections with systems outside ISO.

    - A data recorder shall be installed at the metering location. Data shall be retrieved

from recorders by on-site or remote interrogation. Where the TOs/MPs agree on the
need for joint access to this recorded data, remote communications equipment is
recommended to be installed

    - A multifunction meter shall be equipped with an interval data recorder capable of

storing at least 60 days of interval data and an internal clock. Data shall be retrieved
from the meter by remote interrogation. Where the TOs/MPs agree on a need for
joint access to this recorded data, the meter program shall be secured appropriately.

    - The data recorder or multifunction meter equipped with an interval data recorder

shall not be dependent on the alternating current (ac) voltage that it is metering as
the sole power source if an alternative power source exists at the metering location
(such as an ac station service emergency panel feed, a direct current (dc) battery or
“street power”).

5. All data recorders shall be synchronized in time, within an accuracy of

+/- 15 seconds, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
periodically and when they are installed or returned to service after maintenance or
repair.


-----

6. Compensation for line and/or transformer losses, when used, shall be accomplished by

using Level I or Level II metering accuracy standards as defined in OP-18 Section
IV.B.7 of this OP.

7. DC metering associated with DC coupled Assets participating separately in any market

shall be of equivalent accuracy and precision to AC meters meeting the ANSI C12
standard. Specifications for such devices shall be provided to the ISO and/or Host
Participant upon request.

**IX.** **REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT FOR TELEMETERING**
**SYSTEMS**

To ensure reliable data communications for telemetry, the telemetry equipment (RTU, Digital
Metering, communication equipment etc.) located at and between stations [owned by an MP or
Designated Entity (DE)], the LCCs or SCADA TOs and ISO, the following supporting telemetry
data is required:

1. The equipment shall not be dependent on a single ac power source. The power source

shall be a station battery or an uninterruptible power source capable of supporting the
anticipated load for at least eight hours.

       - Communication only facilities (terminal or intermediate) shall have a battery rated for

at least eight (8) hours and a suitable backup power source for extended periods.

      - This includes telephone company equipment co-located with MP or DE equipment.

      - “Communication facilities” noted above refer to all components (i.e.,: terminal and
intermediate equipment, and communication media) along each path.

2. At stations where two battery systems are present, it is desirable that each of them be

made capable of being a power source for the equipment.

3. The equipment shall be capable of operating in a temperature range of -20°C to +50 °C

for equipment within the control building or -40 °C to +50 °C for equipment installed in
other outdoor enclosures. This temperature range is based upon the conditions that
could exist when the ac power source is lost and as a result, air conditioning or heating
is lost.

4. The configuration/connection of communication circuits shall be designed so that a

problem on one circuit does not cause a problem on another (i.e., the problem does not
propagate). There shall be no single point of failure that leads to communication loss
for more than one station.

5. Alarms shall be provided to the appropriate LCC or SCADA TO indicating the status of

equipment covered by this section.

**X.** **TESTING, CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS**

**A. Overall Requirements**

Each TO/MP is responsible for properly maintaining its metering, recording and telemetering

equipment in accordance with applicable ANSI standards as amended from time-to-time.
The specific standards for testing, calibration and maintenance are put forth in this section.
The accuracy standards to be observed are summarized in OP-18C.

**B. Overall Telemetering System Test**

Whenever transducers and/or telemetering systems are tested, an overall system test shall


-----

also be conducted. This system test includes the use of the calibrated transducers output
as an input to the telemetry system. All receiving devices shall be verified against the
applied input.

**C. Telemetry Component Tests**

To ensure the accuracy of telemetered data, each TO/MP shall do one of the following:

1. Use manual or computerized routines to check telemetered quantities (MW, MVAr & kV)

against each other, revenue meter quantities and/or against derived values of an SE, to
identify unreasonable values at least one day per calendar month as detailed in Section
X.C.1.a of this OP. This option may only be used for equipment after the initial
installation (or replacement) test where IX.C.2 (below) would apply for initial installation
(or replacement).

a. Each single day check shall include 24 data samples for each telemetered point, 1

for each hour of the day.

`o` While individual hour samples may have variations that exceed tolerances, noted

below, where six or more consecutive samples exceed the tolerance in 1-day
appropriate calibration, repairs or replacement actions shall be taken.

`o` Each sample may be from a single point in time within the hour or

averaged/integrated over the hour interval.

`o` Voltage variance, as compared against below tolerances, is each telemetered

phase-phase voltage compared against at least one of the two below:

       - The SE resultant bus voltage associated with the telemetered voltage, given

in, or corrected to, phase-phase

**NOTE**

Concerning average of telemetered voltages, when less than three voltages (of
comparable phase relationship) are measured at the same substation bus, additional
points of reference are needed for comparison. Other points of reference may include,
but are not limited to, adjacent bus voltages, nearby scheduled voltages, or bus voltage
in an SE.

       - The average of all non-zero telemetered voltages that are phase-phase on

the same nominal voltage level at the substation. Busses at the same voltage
level that are not tied shall be treated separately.

b. The tolerances for acceptable MW, MVAr and kV telemetered quantities are as

follows:

`o` Watts: +/- 10 MW or +/- 4.5% of the largest fiducial value
(whichever is smaller)

`o` VArs: +/- 30 MVAr

`o` Voltage: +/- 5 kV for 345 kV systems

+/- 4 kV for 230 kV systems

+/- 3 kV for 115 kV systems

+/- 2 kV for 69 kV systems

+/- 3% for systems below 69kV


-----

c. The check above shall not be required for MVAr quantities if the MVAr quantities are

measured from the same device that measures the telemetered MW quantities.

`o` The purpose for this is that measurement drift of a device measuring both would

cause errors in both MW and MVAr. Also, MVAr variances are often obscured by
transformer losses or SE solutions that are not perfect.

`o` With the bus-net method, MVAr quantities that originate from a different device

than the associated MW telemetry would not be exempt from a MVAr bus-net
even if the other telemetry on the bus had its MW and MVAr quantities measured
from the same device.

`o` If a MVAr bus-net is needed, VAr losses can be estimated based upon

transformer test data to mitigate bus-net VAr error.

2. Calibrate or test the accuracy of transducers and telemetering systems according to

manufacturer’s procedures, on the following schedule:

Transducers: at least once every six years

Analog Telemetry: at least once every twelve months

Digital Telemetry: at least once every six years

When tests are performed on transducers, errors shall not exceed accuracy limits
stated in OP-18C. If during the test, errors exceed this value, the device shall be
recalibrated, repaired or replaced as necessary to attain that accuracy.

Digital telemetry employing analog to digital converter(s) (ADC), the gain and offset
characteristics of which are continuously monitored, and reported to SCADA, by ADC
reference values that are within accuracy limits stated in OP-18C, shall be exempt from
periodic calibration requirements. When accuracy limits stated in OP-18C are
exceeded, the equipment shall be recalibrated, repaired or replaced as necessary to
attain that accuracy. This digital telemetry test exemption may only be used for
equipment after the initial installation (or replacement) accuracy test.

**D. Watt-hour Meters**

1. All Wh meters shall be tested by comparison to a solid-state Wh standard that is

traceable to the NIST as outlined in Section X.F of this OP. Testing shall include an
inspection, verification, and analysis of the metering system excluding instrument
transformers.

2. HVDC Wh meters - dc Wh metering equipment using voltage inputs for current and

voltage sensing shall conform to the following requirements. See Figure 9-1.

a. DC test voltage source equipment for generating current and voltage inputs to the

meter shall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.

b. Voltmeters used for monitoring the input voltages to the dc meter during the test

shall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.

c. Meter nominal test voltage shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the

nominal operating voltage of the metered line.

d. Meter “full load test amperes” shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the

nominal operating current of the metered line.

e. The test points for the meter shall be as follows:

`o` Full load test amperes


-----

`o` 10% of full load test amperes

`o` 50% of full load test amperes

`o` 150% of full load test amperes

f. If meter pulse outputs are compared to calculated target values, and pulses from a

standard, to determine meter accuracy, then worksheets detailing the test conditions
and target pulse counts shall be made available prior to testing the meter. See
Table 9-1, below.

g. If the meter is compensated to account for different operating modes of the metered

circuit, then the meter shall be tested with compensation activated at each of the test
points defined above. The operating modes that represent the normal operating
conditions shall be tested as a part of periodic testing. All operating modes shall be
tested upon commissioning.

h. For engineered (custom) metering systems, a hard copy of the current meter

program shall accompany the meter test documentation.

i. If both revenue meter data and telemetry data are provided by the same meter, then

provisions shall be made to continue the telemetry while the meter is out of the
measurement circuit during the test.

j. If redundant meter schemes are used, then the generation of any alarms or status

flags due to differences in measurement between the meters caused by the testing
shall be documented. If redundant recorders are used, then differences in recorded
pulse totals due to the testing shall also be documented.

k. If redundant meter schemes are used, then the start and stop time as well as the

accumulated test energy for the meter under test shall be documented. In addition,
the start and stop time as well as the accumulated energy during the test period
shall be noted for the in-service meter.

l. A field standard meter that has been programmed identical to the meter under test

may be used for certification provided that it meets the accuracy and certification
requirements of Section IX.F of this OP.

“As-Found” individual element balance test performed. The individual elements
shall be tested at operating or nameplate voltage, at FL test amps, and unity
power factor. The individual element test results shall be within 1.0% of each
other.


-----

v. If the “As-Found” test results are outside the stated accuracy limits in section

X.D.4.a.ii, then the meter shall be adjusted as closely as practical to 0.0% error
or scheduled for replacement as soon as possible. The final “As-Left” test results
shall be within the stated accuracy limits.

vi. Any induction Wh meter found outside of +/- 2.0% error (at any test condition)

shall be adjusted and scheduled for replacement as soon as practical.

b) Single point three-phase test using the actual in-service load and meter uncompensated

[not permitted for testing induction type Wh meters].

i. “As- Found"" three-phase tested at actual in-service voltage, current, and power

factor; provided that:

     - voltage is within the range specified by the meter manufacturer

     - current is within the meter's load range between light-load (LL) and class

amps of the meter, and

     - power factor is between unity and 0.5 lagging or leading

ii. The single point three-phase test results must be within the following accuracy

limits:

Test Condition Accuracy limit

Actual in-service load +/- 0.2% error

iii. If the ""As-Found"" test results are outside the stated accuracy limits, then the

meter shall be adjusted as closely as practical to a 0.0% error or promptly
replaced. The final ""As-Left"" test results shall be within the stated accuracy
limits.

iv. Any solid-state Wh meter found with accuracy tests outside the limits specified in

section X.D.4.b.ii shall either be adjusted and scheduled for replacement as soon
as practical; or, promptly replaced.

5. Meters with compensation for line and/or transformer losses shall be either one or the

other of the following:

  - Series tested with and without the compensation activated at the test points as

defined in Section X.D.4.a of this OP; or

  - Single point tested with compensation checked by comparison of compensated and

uncompensated pulse data channels.

6. In-service testing of Wh meters shall be conducted with the frequency established in the

local state utility control and distribution utility requirements for retail loads such as
Asset Related Demands (ARDs). All other Assets, with noted exception, shall be tested
with the following frequency: all Wh meters shall be tested at least once per calendar
year, with the exception that non-induction type Wh meters, the operation of which is
monitored daily, shall be tested at least once every six calendar years. Generator
Assets that are not Settlement Only Resources and have a registered summer and
winter claimed capability of less than 1 MW shall be tested with the frequency
established in the local state utility control and distribution utility requirements for retail
loads.


-----

7. Periodic Energy Comparison

a) Data recording equipment external to the meter shall be checked monthly by

comparing a summation of the hourly demand readings with the kWh registered on
the Wh meters for the same period of time. When only small quantities (less than
7,200 MWh in one month) have been registered, comparison is required every two
months using two months of data. The difference in the sum of hourly demand
readings and the kWh registered on the Wh meter shall be less than the value of the
Wh meter transformer ratio multiplier. If this difference is greater, then the
installation shall be reviewed and tested if the discrepancy is not explainable. This
requirement is not applicable to DC meters for DC-coupled Assets participating
separately in any market.

b) For DRAs, data recording equipment external to the meter shall be checked at least

annually by comparing a summation of the hourly demand readings with the kWh
registered on the Wh meter for at least one month. If hourly data is available from
the pulse source meter, then comparison shall take place at the hourly level.

8. The continuity of meter readings shall be maintained during tests either by use of a

portable meter or other suitable methods. Note: use of the single point test method
shall provide for continuity of both readings and data. A Wh meter test may be
conducted during a period of no load or when the load is constant and the reading
adjusted upon completion of the test. Pulse data shall also be adjusted upon
completion of the test. If this is not practical, then other methods shall be used to
segregate pulses registered due to the test from pulses based on registration of power
flow.

**E. Instrument Transformers**

Scheduled tests of instrument transformers shall be conducted only if all other tests fail to
explain a discrepancy. The testing procedure shall conform to the manufacturer’s
specifications and ANSI C57.13.

**F. Test Equipment**

Test equipment used in the calibration of instrument transformers or transducers shall be
certified to values of accuracy and precision which are at least twice as accurate as the
required accuracy of the equipment under test. Non-induction type Wh standards of 0.1%
or better accuracy shall be used in the testing of Wh meters. All Wh standards shall be
certified correct every twelve months.

**NOTE**

Traceability refers to relating individual measurement results to NIST measurement
systems through an unbroken chain of comparisons.

All Wh standards shall be certified by comparison with laboratory standards whose
accuracy is traceable to NIST. The standard certification values may be determined by the
use of data obtained through round-robin procedures between TOs/MPs, provided that at
least one of the laboratories maintains standards traceable to NIST. Standards used for
the purpose of calibrating voltage and current transducers shall be of the same sensing
type (e.g., Root Mean Square (RMS) or average) as the transducers under test. All
telemetry standards shall be certified at least once every 24 calendar months.

The tests and calibrations shall be performed at ambient temperatures recommended by


-----

the manufacturers of the test equipment and the equipment under test.

Instrumentation used to check the tone modulating frequency for data transmission shall
have a minimum definition of 0.001 Hertz. The dc ammeter or voltmeter used to measure
input signals shall have a minimum accuracy of +/- 0.05%.

**G. Record Keeping and Auditing**

Each TO/MP shall maintain records of the testing, calibration and verification of all metering
and telemetering equipment which is required to be installed pursuant to the provisions of
this OP. The records shall include:

     - Entity name

     - Element (line, bus, transformer, etc.) name covered by telemetry

     - Name of telemetering device (or system)

      - The dates of testing, calibration or verification

     - % error of as-found (and as-left if recalibrated or replaced)

     - A note, if as-found is not within accuracy tolerance

      - Action(s) taken (if applicable) including date(s) of action(s)

These records shall be retained for a minimum of the two most current testing (or
verification) cycles or since the last audit (whichever is greater) and shall be available to
ISO and the LCC upon request.

**H. Notifications**

When metering and telemetering equipment associated with TO/MP interconnections is
scheduled for maintenance, test or upgrade, then interconnected TOs/MPs shall be notified
at least two weeks in advance in order to have the opportunity to participate in or witness
the maintenance, test or upgrade.

**XI.** **SECURITY OF METERED AND RECORDED DATA**

Security shall be addressed to prevent unlawful, unintentional or unauthorized access to those
portions of the firmware, software and data being collected that would have an effect on the
metered and recorded quantities.

**XII.** **COMPLIANCE**

Periodically, ISO may conduct an audit survey of metering, recording devices and telemetering
criteria to determine the degree of TO/MP compliance with all OP-18 requirements.

-----

**IV.** **GENERATOR REQUIREMENTS**

**A. Data Requirements**

Lead MPs or Interconnection Customers for future Generators shall provide short
circuit modeling characteristics for Generators, Generator step-up transformation
equipment and generator breaker data including dynamic reactive devices as
appropriate. This data shall include the following for existing and planned Generator:

i. Short circuit data required per MOD-032-1 Attachment 1

ii. Updates to generator breaker characteristics and characteristics of any other
higher voltage breakers installed between the generator breaker and the POI
to the transmission system when owned by the Generator.

iii. Other updates to characteristics and impedances associated with Generator
step-up transformation equipment when owned by the Generator.

iv. Dynamic reactive device characteristics when such equipment is owned by
the Generator

ISO shall make data review requests using the SDMS whether the Generator is
inverter based or non-inverter based (e.g. synchronous or rotor based) with an
associated spreadsheet data form previously completed with Generator modeling
data. Data forms for inverter based and non-inverter based Generators differ to more
accurately represent the different technologies. The Lead MP for the Generator shall
review, make any changes required and provide any data identified by ISO as
requiring an update in the SDMS included form. The Lead MP shall recertify the data
as representing the Generator and associated equipment as currently configured.

Each Lead MP shall periodically review and certify the short circuit characteristics. If
the short circuit characteristics of Generator and associated equipment change,
revised data shall be provided. Entities shall maintain their own records of data
submittal and review for audit purposes as necessary. The short circuit data submitted
by a Lead MP pursuant to this Section IV shall be consistent with the other data
required by OP-16 (i.e. NX-9 data).

When updating short circuit characteristics for ISO, each Lead MP shall:

i. If based on an ISO request, notify ISO that the short circuit Generator data,
breaker data for breakers owned by the Generator and Generator step-up
transformation equipment has not changed. In this case, the Lead MP shall
provide or review and certify a copy of the existing characteristics. The ISO
request shall include instructions for data review; or

ii. If not initiated by ISO, e.g. for planned projects or replaced equipment,
provide updates for the data in the spreadsheet data form, that is requested
by ISO.


-----

**B. Data Submittal Method**

Lead MPs shall submit the required data as described in ISO’s data requests using the
SDMS.

For any non-ISO initiated data submittal, including but not limited to submittals
associated with PPAs or facility modifications, Lead MPs shall submit the short circuit
characteristics as described in the most recent ISO request for data.

For a future or modified facility with an associated System Impact Study (SIS), the
models used for the SIS shall be considered the data submittal for short circuit
modeling. Lead MPs or Interconnection Customers for future Generators shall provide
subsequent recertifications using SDMS.

**C. Data Submittal and Certification Schedule**

ISO shall initiate the short circuit data submittal and certification process at least once
every 13 calendar months by issuing a data request.

If modifications are made to short circuit characteristics for planned Generators, Lead
MPs or the Interconnection Customer shall provide updates to short circuit
characteristics as they become available.

Note that submittals of changes to short circuit characteristics via OP-16K do not
supersede the material modification process conducted pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the
ISO Tariff and ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-1 Procedure for Review of
Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans (Section I.3.9
Applications: Requirements, Procedures, and Forms).

**NOTE: If a Lead MP becomes aware that short circuit characteristics provided to ISO**
may be inaccurate, then the Lead MP shall notify ISO as soon as possible that the
short circuit characteristics provided are subject to change. This will provide ISO
operations and planning staff an opportunity to consider the impact of any inaccurate
data until the Lead MP can provide accurate short circuit characteristics to ISO. The
Lead MP shall provide updated data as soon as possible.

**D. Short Circuit Data Certification**

Through the submittal of the annual short circuit data or “as-built” updates, the Lead
MP certifies that the short circuit model provided to ISO accurately represents the
equipment as installed at the time of certification. Additionally, for planned
Generators, the Lead MP certifies the accuracy of the planned facility characteristics.


-----

**V.** **TRANSMISSION OWNERS THAT ARE NOT TRANSMISSION PLANNERS**

**A. Data Requirement**

Each entity that is registered with NERC as a TO but not as a TP shall submit short
circuit data for equipment it owns as requested by ISO for:

i. existing and future equipment designated as part of the BES; and

ii. existing and future facilities that are connected to 69 kV and above.

The short circuit data shall include but not be limited to:

i. Short circuit data required per MOD-032-1 Attachment 1

ii. Updates to 69 kV and higher breaker characteristics.

iii. Updates to equipment associated with Generator step-up transformation
equipment when owned by the TO.

iv. Interconnecting equipment impedance for Generators for equipment owned
by the TO or modeled at buses owned by the TO which are not covered in
Section IV of this OP-16K.

v. Necessary supporting data for Generator and step-up transformation
equipment characteristics for equipment owned by the TO.

TOs shall confirm or provide updated short circuit data based on the spreadsheet data
form provided by ISO with the data request.

The short circuit data submitted by a TO shall be consistent with the other data
required by OP-16 (i.e. NX-9 data).

If a TO owns dynamic devices (excluding Generators) capable of supplying or
absorbing reactive power, then the TO shall provide the short circuit characteristics for
those devices using the spreadsheet data form provided by ISO with the data request.

Data for equipment connected to voltages below 69 kV may be required when ISO
determines that such data is necessary for the reliable planning and operation of the
New England Transmission System. Such data shall be provided to ISO based on the
spreadsheet data form provided by ISO with any ISO request.

When updating short circuit characteristics for ISO, each TO shall either:

i. Notify ISO that the short circuit information owned by the TO has not
changed. In this case, the TO shall provide or review and certify a copy of
the existing characteristics as described in the request; or

ii. In the case of planned projects, provide updates for the data that is
requested by ISO.


-----

**B. Data Submittal Method**

TOs shall submit data as described in the ISO’s data requests.

For a future or modified facility with an associated approved System Impact Study
(SIS) or approved Proposed Plan Application, the associated models used shall be
considered the data submittal. TOs shall make subsequent recertifications as
described by ISO.

**C. Data Submittal and Certification Schedule**

ISO shall initiate the short circuit data submittal and certification process for the
existing system at least once every 13 calendar months by issuing a data request.

If modifications are made to short circuit characteristics of a TO’s planned
transmission projects, the TO shall provide updates to the short circuit characteristics
as they become available.

Note that submittals of changes to transmission short circuit characteristics via OP16K do not supersede the material modification process conducted pursuant to
Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff and ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-1.

**NOTE: If a TO becomes aware that short circuit characteristics provided to ISO may**
be inaccurate, then the TO shall notify ISO as soon as possible that the short circuitcharacteristics provided are subject to change. This will provide ISO operations and
planning staff an opportunity to consider the impact of any inaccurate data until the TO
can provide accurate short circuit characteristics to ISO. The TO shall provide updated
data as soon as possible.

**D. Short Circuit Data Certification**

Through the submittal of the annual short circuit data, the TO certifies that the short
circuit model provided to ISO accurately represents the equipment as installed at the
time of certification. Additionally, when submitting updates for a planned transmission
project, the TO certifies the accuracy of the planned transmission project’s
characteristics.


-----

**VI.** **TRANSMISSION OWNER-TRANSMISSION PLANNERS**

**A. Data Requirement**

Year (N) Case Reviews

Each entity that is registered with NERC as a TP for the New England region shall
provide to ISO a short circuit model for all existing transmission equipment connected
to 69 kV and above that is owned by the TP and SORs within the TP service area.
The short circuit data shall include but not be limited to:

i. Short circuit data required per MOD-032-1 Attachment 1

ii. Updates to 69 kV and higher breaker characteristics.

iii. Updates to equipment associated with Generator step-up transformation
equipment when owned by the TP.

iv. Generator interconnecting equipment owned by the TP that is not covered in
Section IV of OP-16K.

v. Updates to dynamic devices dedicated to supplying or absorbing reactive
power that are owned by the TP.

vi. Effective March 1, 2023, the TP shall provide aggregate models for each
distribution substation with SORs comprising generation that totals over 1 MW.
In the Year N case, the aggregate models shall include existing SORs. The
aggregate inverter models can be interconnected to a radial distribution bus,
where the distribution bus is connected to the associated transmission bus with
a delta (system side) - wye (inverter side) distribution transformer (e.g.
115/13.kV). If no existing transformer is available, the aggregate model shall
include an interconnecting transformer with parameters provided by the Short
Circuit Working Group. ISO shall provide a list of SORs and TOs shall review
and ensure that double counting of SOR assets does not occur in the ASPEN
case with other models.

**NOTE: When a distribution substation is supplied from more than one**
transmission substation, the SOR aggregate model will be connected to the
distribution substation in a manner that reflects the splitting of short circuit current
from the distribution system to the transmission system while minimizing the
extent of the distribution system that needs to be represented in the model. This
modeling approach is meant to capture splitting of short circuit current from the
aggregate model through the distribution system to the transmission system and
not require additional modeling of the distribution system.

If there is no distribution substation in the ASPEN case then the aggregate SOR
model will be connected to the closest transmission substation.


-----

TPs shall provide the data in the format as described in Section VI.B of OP-16K.

The short circuit data submitted by a TP shall be consistent with the other data
required by OP-16 (i.e. NX-9 data).

TPs shall provide periodic updates per ISO’s request for the current system according
to the schedule in Table 1. The changes provided shall include facilities that were
placed in-service since the last update and any modeling revisions that are required to
be made to the most recent Year N Case.

When revising the New England case that is provided by ISO, each TP shall submit an
ASPEN OneLiner (OLR) file representing the short circuit model for the current
system, ASPEN change files (CHF), comma-separated values (CSV) files when
appropriate to modify existing modeling information within the data browser, and
modified versions of the CAMs data which reflects SOR aggregates, the Aspen bus
name, number and KV they are connected to. In the data that the TP provides in the
OLR and CHF, each TP shall:

i. Include change files that compare the revised case to the original case. The
original case shall be the most recent Year N Case that is posted on the
SCWG ShareFile.

a. If multiple incremental change files are provided and order of

implementation is important, then the TP shall number the change files
to indicate the order of implementation.

ii. Verify that all of the changes are made to equipment owned by the TP only
and that no changes are made to the facilities of another TP, TO or GO.

iii. Include branch impedance for interconnecting Generator equipment if it is
owned by the TP. However, the TP shall not modify equipment data for
Generator equipment as described in Section IV of this OP-16 K if the
equipment is not owned by the TP

iv. Use border buses to reflect TP ownership changes in line sections.

v. Make any hidden buses visible

vi. To the extent possible, avoid changing the graphical coordinates of facilities.

If the TP does not utilize the ASPEN OneLiner software, data shall be provided to ISO
in a manner approved by ISO such that it can be easily translated and integrated into
an OLR short circuit case.

With each submittal of short circuit data, each TP shall provide documentation that
lists the changes submitted. The document shall include RSP Project List and asset
condition list project identification numbers[2] where applicable.

**Year N+5 Case Reviews**

TPs shall perform periodic reviews of the Year N+5 Case provided by ISO according to
the schedule in Table 1. The review shall include future facilities that ISO has included
in the case since the last update and any modeling revisions that are needed in the
most recent Year N+5 Case.

If, after its review, a TP determines that it is necessary to revise the Year N+5 Case
that is provided by ISO, that TP shall submit an OLR file representing the revised Year
N+5 Case short circuit case and associated CHF. The files shall meet the
requirements for current year (N) as described above. With each submittal of short
circuit data revisions, the TP shall provide documentation that lists the revisions
submitted.

i. Modeling of SORs in the Year N+5 case shall follow the method outlined in
Section VI.A.vi where the the Transmission Planner shall provide the
aggregated models with existing SORs as updated to reflect any Proposed Plan
Application generation changes or retirements.

**B. Data Submittal Method**

The following shall be submitted electronically via the TP subdirectory on the SCWG
ShareFile site, when changes are submitted as a part of an update:

i. Update the change log to document changes and revisions

ii. ASPEN OLR file with changes/revisions included

iii. ASPEN CHF based on the most recent short circuit case(s) on the SCWG
ShareFile

the impact of any inaccurate data until the TP can provide accurate short circuit
characteristics to ISO. The TP shall provide updated data as soon as possible.

**D. Short Circuit Data Certification**

Through the submittal of the quarterly short circuit data, the TP certifies that the short
circuit model provided to ISO accurately represents the equipment as installed at the
time of certification[3] and that the TP has reviewed the Year N+5 case for accuracy.

**VII.** **ISO AS THE PLANNING COORDINATOR**

ISO shall prepare a monthly New England area Year N Case and a Year N + 5 Case
that shall include available updates for:

i. Generator short circuit data

ii. TO short circuit data

iii. TP short circuit data

ISO shall add future projects based on PPA approval for the Near-Term Transmission
Planning Horizon.

type of information changes

_2.2 Spaces shall be used to separate names or words if they are part of the same_

information

2.2.1 A space should always be used between a cardinal direction and the name
2.2.2 There should be no spaces within a station ID

3.0 Bus Voltage

3.1 Do not include the nominal bus voltage since it has its own field when adding

the bus

**E. BUS NAMING CONVENTIONS**

1.0 Standard Bus

1.1 Standard Bus: StationName_StationID; where the StationName is up to twelve (12)

characters and the StationID is up to three (3) characters. If a TP does not use a

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all series reactive devices, including Smartvalve devices, designated as
part of the Bulk Electric System[1] (BES) or connecting to the New England
Transmission System[2] at a voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the
Transmission Owners and Market Participants who own the equipment.[3]

If a series reactive device cannot be switched in or out independently of the
associated line, the impedance and rating information for the series reactive device
may be combined with the line data and the combined total may be submitted on a
single NX-9A form. On all new and revised NX-9A forms, if a series reactive
device is combined with a line and reported on a single combined NX-9A form, the
MP or TO shall update the Participant Equipment Notes field to indicate that the
NX-9A form includes the series reactive device information.

Data for series reactive devices connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV
may be required when ISO determines that the data is necessary for reliable
operation of the New England Transmission System. When required by ISO, the
TO or MP shall submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s
notification.

For Smartvalve devices, a document (.pdf format) defining the various impedance
settings shall be included as a file attachment to the NX-9H form.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

The NX-9H form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot
be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for
all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment. Terminals
are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO NX-9
[Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
needed.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is
retiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to a
change in configuration.

1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section

I.2.2.

3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners

(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants
for Generator Assets (collectively MPs).

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

To assist in completing the NX-9H form, completed sample NX-9H forms are
attached (Examples 1, 2 and 3).

**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Facility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures
for Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”
(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0
Collaborative Development of Rating Procedures. A facility rating shall equal the
rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay loadability limits[4],
and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and any
other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This requirement
does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it successor
standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay setting to create
a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9H form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings. The ambient
temperature (reported in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (reported in feet per second)
used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating set. If ratings
for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9H form, comments
that describe the associated circumstances for use of the special ratings are
required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement as to the
authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and distribution of
these special ratings.

**IV.** **CHARACTERISTRIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Indicate the device type by selecting capacitor, inductor or reactor in the Device
Type field.

Provide positive sequence impedance data in percent on a 100 MVA base.
Impedance data provided shall represent the incremental impedance that is
realized when the series device is in service. Impedance for the associated line will
account for total impedance when the series device is out of service. Impedance
on NX-9H forms shall be calculated and provided out to at least the 3[rd] decimal
place.

R = resistance
X = reactance

For Smartvalve devices, provide the impedance values expected to be in use the
majority of the time.

**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

Any time an NX-9H form is modified or created, a brief description of the reason(s)
for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will provide a
written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in
the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9H form. For
example: Rating changes due to replacement of switch XYZ.

This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9H form review and approval process.

**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**

The Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other
pertinent or operational information. For example: In the normal configuration,
equipment is bypassed and out of service.

Fields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is
available to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only by
the MP or TO owning the record.

Equipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9H form is updated. MPs and
TOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer
pertinent. ISO is responsible for maintaining ISO notes.

**I.** **DYNAMIC MODELING AND DATA REQUIREMENTS**

Dynamics equipment characteristics shall be provided by the Market Participant
(MP), Lead Market Participant (Lead MP), or Transmission Owner (TO) for the
following equipment[1] connecting to the New England Transmission system at 69 kV
and above, or designated as part of the Bulk Electric System[2], (BES).

    - Dynamic Reactive Devices (DRDs) including but not limited to; Static
Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs), Static VAR Compensators (SVCs),
and synchronous condensers

   - Other Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) Devices

   - High Voltage Direct Current (HVdc) transmission system steady-state and
dynamics characteristics

Data for equipment connected at voltages less than 69 kV may be requested by
ISO New England (ISO) if it determines a need.

    - The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall provide models as described in Sections a

through c below:

a. The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall only use PSS/E standard library models

unless they are for equipment covered by section I.b or I.c below. The PSS/E
standard library models used shall not be identified by NERC to be prohibited
or discouraged for use in interconnection-wide cases.

b. For equipment installed with a new type of technology[3] that cannot be

represented by PSS/E standard library models that is first brought in service
after October 12, 2021, user-written (i.e. user-written, user or user-defined)
models will be allowed on a temporary basis, provided there is a written
commitment from the equipment owner, with written acknowledgement from
Siemens PTI, to develop an appropriate standard library model in PSS/E at
the earliest opportunity in the software development cycle.

c. For equipment installed and first brought into service before October 12,

1 An increasing number of reactive resources are being used to provide the same essential reliability services
(ERS) as generation resources to ensure reliability of the BPS such as voltage control, frequency control,
and ramping/balancing capability. Applicability of relevant equipment to consider as Dynamic Reactive

3 For the purposes of this provision, a new type of technology is one which has never been represented in
the PSS/E standard library. For example, at the time of the addition of this provision, the PSS/E standard
library did not contain any model that represented grid forming inverter technology and so this is considered
a new type of technology for the purposes of this provision. An enhancement to a technology that is already
captured in the standard library, such as an upgrade to a static excitation system or a newer version of gridfollowing inverter controls used to connect a wind or solar project do not constitute a new type of technology
for this provision.

2021, for which a standard library file has never been provided, user-written
models are acceptable, though the equipment owner is encouraged to
transition to an appropriate PSS/E standard library model as soon as
possible.

For a new or modified facility with an associated System Impact Study (SIS) or
Proposed Plan Application (PPA), the models used for the SIS or PPA shall be
considered the data submittal for dynamic equipment modeling. For equipment
owned by generators, the ISO will perform the initial upload of this model into the
Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS). TOs and Qualified Transmission
Project Sponsors shall perform the initial upload of the model into DDMS for
equipment that they own. TOs, Lead MPs, or Interconnection Customers for
planned equipment installations shall provide subsequent recertifications prior to
initial energization using the DDMS, when requested by ISO. Prior to energizing the
facility, TOs, Lead MPs or Interconnection Customers shall provide documentation
using DDMS to support the dynamic models representing facilities as-built including
but not limited to manufacturer models, test reports verifying models and nameplate
data and shall include updated PSS®/E files such as .dyr, .dll and .raw files.

System load dynamic demand characteristics were developed by ISO and
Transmission Planners in conjunction with subject matter experts. Each
Transmission Customer, TO or Distribution Provider (DP) shall review the dynamic
load model characteristics and provide an update as required per an ISO data
request and provide the response as described with the data request.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

   - The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall provide equipment data models, as described and

defined in the Compliance Bulletin – [MOD-032 and ISO New England’s Model](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2015/06/iso_new_england_compliance_bulletin_mod_032.pdf)
[Data Requirements and Reporting Procedures in the requested PSS[®]/E version](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2015/06/iso_new_england_compliance_bulletin_mod_032.pdf)
format.

   - Questions regarding ISO-specific dynamic data and dynamic demand data

requirements should reference “MOD-032 and OP-16 Appendix J” and should be
directed to the ISO Participant Support department.

**III.** **DYNAMICS DATA SUBMITTAL SCHEDULE**

The applicable MP, Lead MP or TO shall submit dynamics data for a new facility
and modification to an existing facility consistent with the schedules defined in
Section I.3.9 of the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services
Tariff (Tariff). Prior to energizing the facility, the applicable MP, Lead MP or TO
shall provide updates to represent the facility as-built.

The MP, Lead MP or TO shall verify the accuracy of existing system load dynamic
demand characteristics and/or submit updated characteristics within 45 calendar
days or longer if defined in the ISO data request. Data shall be provided using the
Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS) or in the manner as otherwise

described in the ISO data request.

ISO shall review all submitted data to verify that it is complete, reasonable and
consistent with the related data and with the reason for the revision. ISO shall notify
the MP, Lead MP, or TO of any discrepancies. The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall
provide corrections to the data within 90 calendar days of the notification of the
discrepancies, as defined in MOD-032.

**IV.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

When dynamics model data changes, the MP, Lead MP, or TO shall include with all
DDMS submittals the updated PSS®/E files such as .dyr, .dll and .raw files needed
to model the facility as configured. A copy of the manufacturer nameplate either by
document (.pdf format) or digital photograph (.tif or .jpg formats) if changed, and the
equipment test report document verifying dynamic model and parameters (.pdf
format) shall be submitted to support the dynamic model changes (this is not
required for component replacements that do not alter capability or dynamic
performance). The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall include a brief description of the
reason(s) for the change any time that dynamics data is modified. This shall provide
a written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in
the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update.

**I.** **OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE**

Each year ISO shall initiate an NX-9 certification process for Transmission Owners
(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or
Lead Market Participants for Generator Assets (collectively MPs). This process
requires that the MP or TO certify that all transmission facilities described in ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission System Data (OP-16) and its
appendices are accurately represented in the ISO NX Application. The certification will
be issued in January of each year unless otherwise communicated to the MP’s NX-9
administrators and compliance contacts identified in the ISO Customer and Asset
Management System (CAMS).

Accurate and complete data is critical to the creation of the database models used in
real-time reliability operations, market operations, operations planning and to the
computer applications that operate on those models.

This certification process shall serve to ensure that the NX-9 data on file at ISO meets
the requirements of OP-16 and its appendices.

**II.** **GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS**

ISO shall initiate the NX-9 certification process by sending a request for selfcertification to the MP or TO NX-9 administrators and compliance contacts identified in
ISO CAMS that includes the date by which the MP or TO shall respond.

The MP or TO shall ensure that the NX-9 data contained in the NX Application is
accurate, complete and reflects the actual physical characteristics, ratings, and
operational limits of all New England Transmission System[1] equipment defined in OP16 and its appendices and in service on or before the certification initiation date.

Upon ensuring that no changes to the NX-9 data are necessary to comply with OP-16
and its appendices, or when all data changes necessary to comply with OP-16 and its
appendices have been submitted, the MP or TO shall notify the ISO by selecting the
Notify ISO-NE Data is Complete checkbox on the Annual Certification display of the
NX Application. Such notification shall be completed by a date specified by ISO that is
at least thirty (30) calendar days from the certification initiation date. Data corrections
discovered after the MP or TO has notified ISO that their data is complete for
certification shall be submitted in accordance with the normal submission schedule
and shall not be considered part of the current certification.

ISO shall review any submitted data. Upon approval of all data submitted for
certification compliance, ISO shall provide the Certification of ISO New England
Transmission Equipment Rating, Characteristic, and Operational Data form
(Attachment 1) to the MP or TO.

The MP or TO shall upload the completed and signed Certification of ISO New
England Transmission Equipment Rating, Characteristic, and Operational Data form to

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all transmission equipment designated as part of the Bulk Electric
System[1] (BES) or connecting to the New England Transmission System[2] at a
voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the Transmission Owners and
Market Participants who own the equipment.[3] This includes shunt connected
dynamic reactive power devices, voltage sensing phase shifters and other
equipment not previously defined in this procedure and installed on the New
England Transmission System.

Data for equipment connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV may be
required when ISO determines the data is necessary for reliable operation of the
New England Transmission System. When required by ISO, the TO or MP shall
submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s notification.

While specific NX-9 forms for each of these equipment types do not exist, data
required for reliable operation of the New England Transmission System can be
input on the existing NX forms, NX-9A, NX-9B, NX-9C,NX-9D, NX-9G, NX-9H,
and NX-12D. This Appendix shall serve as a guide for using these NX-9 and NX12D forms to provide data for equipment other than the equipment specified in
those Appendices.

ISO recognizes that these instructions may not readily fit all equipment added to
the system. If this is the case, please contact the ISO NX-9 Administrator
[(nx9admin@iso-ne.com) to discuss and come to agreement on how to represent](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
the equipment on the available forms.

MPs or TOs adding equipment connecting at voltages that are 69 kV and greater
and not defined within OP-16 Appendices A, B, C, D, G, H or I shall contact the
[ISO NX-9 Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) for instructions for providing](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
NX-9 data.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

All NX-9 forms provide for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot
be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for
all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall be initially entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment.
Terminals are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO

1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section

I.2.2.

3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners

(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants
for Generator Assets (collectively MPs).


-----

[NX-9 Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
needed.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is
retiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to
a change in configuration.

**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

When required, as defined in sections VI-VII of this Appendix, facility rating data
shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole number) and
determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures for
Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”
(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0
Collaborative Development of Rating Procedures. A facility rating shall equal the
rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay loadability
limits[4], and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and
any other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This
requirement does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it
successor standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay
setting to create a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9 form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings. The ambient
temperature (reported in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (reported in feet per
second) used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating set.
If ratings for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9 form,
comments that describe the associated circumstances for use of the special
ratings are required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement
as to the authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and
distribution of these special ratings.

**IV.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

Any time an NX-9 form is modified or created, a brief description of the reason(s)
for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will provide a
written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in
the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9 form.
This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9 form review and approval process.

**V.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**

The Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other
pertinent or operational information.

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts.


-----

Fields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is
available to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only
by the MP or TO owning the record.

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all static capacitors and reactors designated as part of the Bulk Electric
System[1] (BES) or connecting to the New England Transmission System[2] at a
voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the Transmission Owners and
Market Participants who own the equipment.[3]

Data for static capacitors and reactors connected at voltages that are less than
69 kV may be required when ISO determines that the data is necessary for
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System. When required by
ISO, the TO or MP shall submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s
notification.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

The NX-9D form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields
cannot be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing
data for all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment.
Terminals are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO
NX-9 Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are
needed.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is
retiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to
a change in configuration.

system voltage, the nameplate MVAR capability shall be converted to the MVAR
capability at the nominal system voltage.

Mode of Operation - Indicate the mode of operation of the device. The mode of
operation selected should reflect the operational state that the device is expected to be
in the majority of the time.

Manual-Local - Switching of the device is performed locally at the substation.

         - If protective settings exist for operation of the device, provide these

settings in the Equipment Notes field.

Manual-Remote - Switching of the device is typically performed via SCADA by
an LCC System Operator[4] or a TO control room operator. Device controls are
not normally operated in voltage sensing mode. Use voltage sensing mode
when device controls are normally operated in voltage sensing, yet when typical
device switching is performed via SCADA.

         - Enter the voltages at which the device will be switched on and off (high

and low) based upon operator practice, typical use and local training
regime, in that order.

         - Switching time delay: Enter 999 to indicate that time is variable and

dependent on multiple factors.

         - If protective settings exist for operation of the device, provide these

settings in the Equipment Notes field.

Time Schedule - Device controls are normally operated via a pre-programmed
time or load schedule.

         - Enter the actual time/load schedule used for switching in the Equipment

Notes field.

         - If multiple schedules (i.e., weekday/weekend, light load/heavy load)

apply, provide these schedules in the Equipment Notes field.

        - If the device can be expected to be switched in/out by an LCC System

Operator or a TO control room operator action with SCADA control,
provide the voltage levels used to make switching decisions in the
Equipment Notes field.

Voltage Sensing - Device controls are normally in an automatic, voltage sensing
mode.

         - Enter the automatic voltage settings at which the device will be switched

on and off.

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all variable reactors designated as part of the Bulk Electric System[1]
(BES) or connecting to the New England Transmission System[2] at a voltage of
69 kV or greater shall be provided by the Transmission Owners and Market
Participants who own the equipment.[3]

Data for variable reactors connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV may be
required when ISO determines that the data is necessary for reliable operation of
the New England Transmission System. When required by ISO, the TO or MP
shall submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s notification.

A copy of the manufacturer’s nameplate, either by document (.pdf format) or
digital photograph (.tif or .jpg formats), shall be included as a file attachment to
NX-9G forms for new or replaced equipment and to new NX-9G forms for
variable reactor equipment previously reported using the NX-9B form.

A copy of the manufacturer’s test report document (in .pdf format) shall be
included as a file attachment to NX-9G forms for new or replaced equipment and
to new NX-9G forms for variable reactor equipment previously reported using the
NX-9B form.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

The NX-9G form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields
cannot be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing
data for all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment.
Terminals are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO
[NX-9 Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
needed.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is
retiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to
a change in configuration.

these instructions.

1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section

I.2.2.

3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners

(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants
for Generator Assets (collectively MPs)


-----

To assist in completing the NX-9G form, sample manufacturer's nameplate data
and a completed NX-9G form utilizing that data are attached (Example 1).

All tap position item responses shall indicate tap positions using numbers (1, 2,
3, 4, etc.) as opposed to letters (a, b, c, d, etc.).

**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Facility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures
for Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”
(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0
Collaborative Development of Rating Procedures. A facility rating shall equal the
rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay loadability
limits[4], and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and
any other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This
requirement does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it
successor standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay
setting to create a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9G form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings as well as ratings for
special conditions or configurations. The ambient temperature (reported in
Fahrenheit) used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating
set. If ratings for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9G
form, comments that describe the associated circumstances for use of the
special ratings are required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a
statement as to the authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use
and distribution of these special ratings.

**IV.** **CHARACTERISTIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Complete the following fields as instructed below:

Control Type – Indicate the normal control mode based upon the descriptions
below. The Control Type selected should reflect the operational state that the
device is expected to be in the majority of the time.

Manual-Local – Reactor is operated locally at the substation.

Manual-Remote – Tap changes are typically made using the SCADA
system and initiated by an LCC System Operator[5] or a TO control room
operator.

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts

5 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

Auto – Reactor has controls which are set up for complete automatic
operation. Tap changes typically occur without LCC System Operator or
TO control room operator intervention.

Nominal Capability

Fixed – Provide the fixed capability (MVAR) calculated at nominal system
voltage and 60 Hertz.

Variable – This value is calculated by the NX Application as Maximum –
Fixed

Maximum – Provide the maximum capability (MVAR) calculated at
nominal system voltage and 60 Hertz.

Impedance Data Table - For each position listed, Minimum, Midpoint, Nameplate
and Maximum, provide the following values:

Tap # @ MVAR Consumption – Indicate the tap number at the listed
position.

MVAR Consumption – Indicate the MVAR consumption at the listed
position.

Impedance X – Provide the positive sequence reactance (X) calculated in
percent on a 100 MVA base at the listed position. Do not adjust values to
nominal system voltage. Impedance on NX-9G forms shall be calculated
and provided out to at least the 3rd decimal place.

**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

Any time an NX-9G form is modified or created, a brief description of the
reason(s) for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will
provide a written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment
changes made in the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of
the NX-9G form. For example: Ratings modified due to replacement of
previously limiting terminal equipment.

This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9G form review and approval process.

successor standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay
setting to create a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9C form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings as well as ratings for
special conditions or configurations. The ambient temperature (reported in
Fahrenheit) used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating
set. If ratings for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9C
form, comments that describe the associated circumstances for use of the
special ratings are required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a
statement as to the authority of the ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for
use and distribution of these special ratings.

**IV.** **CHARACTERISTIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Complete the following fields as instructed below:

Nameplate kV - Provide the phase shifting transformer voltage rating for all
connections as listed on the nameplate document.

Impedance Data - Provide the positive sequence resistance (R) and reactance
(X) associated with the nameplate kV, in percent on a 100 MVA base at the tap
value with the minimum impedance multiplier (typically 1). Do not adjust values
to nominal system voltage. Impedance on new or revised NX-9C forms shall be
calculated and provided out to at least the 3[rd] decimal place.

Transformer Type - Indicate the type of the transformer based upon the
descriptions below:

Auto (AWR) - Transformer has controls that are capable of complete
automatic operation. May be remotely controlled by an LCC System
Operator[5] or a TO control room operator via SCADA.

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts.

5 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

Non-Auto - Transformer does not have controls for complete automatic
operation. May be remotely controlled by an LCC System Operator or a
TO control room operator via SCADA.

Normal Operating Mode - Indicate the normal operating mode based upon the
descriptions below. The normal operating mode selected should reflect the
operational state that the transformer is expected to be in the majority of the time:

Auto - Transformer controls are set up for complete automatic operation.
Tap changes typically occur without LCC System Operator or TO control
room operator intervention.

Manual-Remote - Tap changes are typically made using the SCADA
system and are remotely initiated by an LCC System Operator or a TO
control room operator. Device controls are not normally operated in flow
sensing mode.

Manual-Local - Switching of the device is performed locally at the
substation.

Auto Mode Tap Switching Time Delay – For phase shifters with the Normal
Operating Mode field set to Auto, indicate the tap switching time delay before tap
changes initiate (in seconds).

Normal Tap Position Number - Heavy Load/Light Load - This is required for all
phase shifters whose Normal Operating Mode field is set to Manual-Remote or
Manual-Local.

For the purposes of this document, heavy load shall mean the summer
months of June through August and light load shall mean the remaining
calendar months of January through May and September through
December.

For phase shifters whose Normal Operating Mode field is set to ManualRemote, indicate the tap position number at which the transformer is
normally operated for heavy load conditions and for light load conditions.

For phase shifters whose Normal Operating Mode field is set to ManualLocal, indicate the tap position number at which the transformer is
normally operated for heavy load conditions and for light load conditions.

Step Size - Indicate the change in angle (degrees) per change in tap position.

Maximum Angle - Indicate the maximum angle (degrees). This should be the
angle associated with the first (top) tap indicated in the tap multiplier table

Minimum Angle - Indicate the minimum angle (degrees). This should be the
angle associated with the last (bottom) tap indicated in the tap multiplier table.


-----

Advancing Tap Increases MW Flow From Terminal A to Terminal B - Select if an
advance in tap setting results in increased flow from terminal A to terminal B.

Tap Multiplier Table

Tap Number - Indicate tap numbers of available taps. First tap number
(tap number entered nearest to the top of the column) should correspond
to the tap at which maximum angle is achieved.

Impedance Tap Correction Multiplier - Indicate the phase shifter tap
impedance correction multiplier adjacent to the appropriate tap positions.

**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

Any time an NX-9C form is modified or created, a brief description of the
reason(s) for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will
provide a written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment
changes made in the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of
the NX-9C form. For example: New equipment installation.

This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9C form review and approval process.

**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**

The Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other
pertinent or operational information. For example: Rating is for phase shifter
only. Refer to NX-9A for cable rating that is in series with this phase shifter and
may be more limiting.

Fields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is
available to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only
by the MP or TO owning the record.

Equipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9C form is updated. MPs and
TOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer
pertinent. ISO is responsible for maintaining ISO notes.

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all transmission line segments designated as part of the Bulk Electric
System[1] (BES) or connecting to the New England Transmission System[2] at a
voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the Transmission Owners and
Market Participants who own the equipment.[3]

Data for other line segments connecting at voltages that are less than 69 kV may
be required when ISO determines that the data is necessary for reliable operation
of the New England Transmission System. When required by ISO, the TO or MP
shall submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s notification.

NX-9A data form requirements for lines associated with generator connections:

All generators participating in the Real-Time Energy Market and connecting
via a line of any voltage level that is dedicated solely to the generation
interconnection (i.e., via an express feeder) will be evaluated for impact to
the ISO EMS Network Model. Based on this evaluation, NX-9A data forms
may be required.

When NX-9A data is determined to be required,

         - The TO shall provide NX-9A data for the line(s) from its connecting

substation to the point of change of ownership between the generator
and the TO.

        - The Generator Asset Lead MP shall provide NX-9A data for the

line(s) from the generator step-up (GSU) transformer to the point of
change of ownership between the generator and the TO.

NX-9A data forms are not required for a line(s) between the transmission
system and a generator when customer load is also served from the line.

NX-9A data forms are not required for lines connecting solely to Settlement
Only Generators.

Submission of an NX-9A for a line segment internal to a substation is not required
when the following conditions are met and the exemption has been approved by
the ISO NX-9 Administrator:

       - The total reactance (x) of the segment (all owners) is less than 0.01

(percent on a 100 MVA base)

       - The segment is not part of a 3-terminal line tap

      - The MW and MVAR of the segment are not metered

       - All potentially limiting equipment is included in the rating calculation of

the adjacent equipment

1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section

I.2.2.

3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners

(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants
for Generator Assets (collectively MPs).

A transmission line segment is defined as follows:

As used by the ISO nodal network model, a line segment is a transmission
path between two (2) electrical nodes of the same kV level. For multiterminal lines, a line segment is defined for each electrical node connecting
to a common tap. In the example below, the four (4) terminals; A, B, C and
D, are connected by three (3) line segments. These segments are: 1) A to
B; 2) B to C; and 3) B to D. In this example, B is the common tap. Each of
the three segments is treated as a separate segment for which ISO
Identification Numbers are assigned and transmission rating and
characteristic data is required.

B
A C

D

A separate NX-9A form shall be provided for each transmission line segment. ISO
shall provide ISO Identification Numbers for all line segments. On any jointly
owned line, each MP or TO shall report the data for only that portion of the line
segment that it owns or is otherwise responsible for providing as described above.

If a series reactive device cannot be switched in or out independently of the
associated line, the impedance and rating information for the series reactive device
may be combined with the line data and the combined total may be submitted on a
single NX-9A form. On all new and revised NX-9A forms, if a series reactive
device is combined with a line and reported on a single combined NX-9A form, the
MP or TO shall update the Participant Equipment Notes field to indicate that the
NX-9A form includes the series reactive device information.

Series reactive devices operated independently of the line shall be reported on the
NX-9H form using the instructions in Operating Procedure 16, Appendix H.

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

The NX-9A form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot
be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for
all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment. Terminals
are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO NX-9
[Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
needed.

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **ll d**


-----

In the Cable Type field select “Overhead,” “Underground” or “Both.” Select “Both”
if the NX-9A form contains information for both overhead conductor and
underground cable.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is being
retired from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to a
change in configuration.

To assist in completing the NX-9A form, a completed sample NX-9A form is
attached (Example 1).

**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Facility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures
for Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”
(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0
Collaborative Development of Rating Procedures. A facility rating shall equal the
rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay loadability limits[4],
and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and any
other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This requirement
does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it successor
standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay setting to create
a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9A form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings. The ambient
temperature (reported in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (reported in feet per second)
used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating set. If ratings
for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9A form, comments
that describe the associated circumstances for use of the special ratings are
required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement as to the
authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and distribution of
these special ratings.

**IV.** **CHARACTERISTIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Provide positive sequence impedance data in percent on a 100 MVA base.
Impedance on new or revised NX-9A forms shall be calculated and provided out to
at least the 3[rd] decimal place.

R = resistance
X = reactance
B = susceptance

**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts.

**H** **d C** **I** **U** **ll d**


-----

Any time an NX-9A form is modified or created, a brief description of the reason(s)
for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will provide a
written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in
the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9A form. For
example: ABC line was re-conductored in January, 2011.

This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9A form review and approval process.

**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**

The Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other
pertinent or operational information. For example: Border point is switch 123.

Fields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is
available to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only by
the MP or TO owning the record.

Equipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9A form is updated. MPs and
TOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer
pertinent. ISO is responsible for maintaining ISO notes.

**I.** **OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE**

Data that defines and represents the physical characteristics, ratings, and
operational data of all New England Transmission System[1] equipment, is required
to develop accurate system models and maintain the day-to-day reliable operation
of the New England bulk power generation and transmission system. The timely
submission of accurate and complete data is critical to the creation of the models
used in Real-Time reliability operations, market operations, operations planning
and to the applications that operate on those models.

It is the responsibility of Transmission Owners (TOs) and Market Participants, i.e.,
Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants for
Generator Assets (collectively MPs) to determine and submit the required data for
new, reconductored, and reconfigured facilities for all their transmission
equipment in accordance with the submission schedules in Sections II and IV of
this ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission System Data
(OP-16).

**NOTE**

The requirement for distribution transformers with a high side winding that
connects at voltages of 69 kV or greater became effective on 5/4/12. Those that
are not currently on file with ISO New England (ISO) will continue to be added in
collaboration between ISO and the MPs and TOs.

ISO will maintain an application housing NX-9 data for all existing transmission
equipment, as provided by the MPs and TOs on the appropriate NX-9 form (see
Section V). ISO is also responsible for acquiring the data for that portion of any
transmission facility that is beyond the ISO border.

MPs and TOs shall collaborate with ISO in developing or revising rating
procedures, establishing ratings for new transmission facilities and modifying
ratings of existing transmission facilities consistent with Planning Procedure
No. 7 (PP7). A facility rating shall equal the rating of the most limiting individual
equipment that comprises the facility, shall reflect relay loadability limits[2] and shall
account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and any other
equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This requirement
does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it successor
standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay setting to create
a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

ISO will internally implement data that is submitted by the MP or TO after such
data has been reviewed and approved in accordance with OP-16 and its
appendices and ISO has been notified that it is effective. Notification of data
approval or implementation will be sent via email to ISO staff and external

stakeholders who have requested such notification in the ISO Customer and
Asset Management System (CAMS).

Questions regarding NX-9 data requirements or use of the NX-9 application

immediately, the Requested Effective Date field shall be the date submitted
plus one day.

Actual Effective Date:

The Actual Effective Date field shall be populated with the date the NX-9 data
went into effect in the field. Entry of the actual effective date will trigger a notice
to the ISO NX-9 Administrator that the data can be implemented in ISO
applications.

For both modifications to existing equipment and for new equipment, the MP or
TO shall populate the NX-9 form’s Actual Effective Date field as soon as
possible upon completion of work.

For corrections to NX-9 equipment data that are effective immediately, the
actual effective date shall be the date that the correct data was determined and
shall be entered by the MP or TO at the time of form submittal.

**IV.** **ONE-LINE SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS**

ISO will maintain an application housing all one-line schematic diagrams (onelines) provided by the MPs and TOs. These one-lines are required to be on file for
use by ISO and the LCCs. ISO will use these one-lines to define the substation
model. MPs and TOs shall provide their one-lines using the one-line form in the
ISO web-based application.


-----

MPs and TOs shall provide documentation that identifies equipment changes,[4]
additions or removals and/or nomenclature changes on revised one-lines by
providing a description of the changes in the one-line form revision comments field.

When uploading a revised one-line, the one-line being replaced shall be
terminated.

Required facility one-lines:

MPs and TOs shall provide new or revised individual station one-lines of all
substations containing equipment designated as part of the Bulk Electric
System[5] (BES) or with equipment operating at voltages of 69 kV or greater.

Lead MPs for Generator Assets shall provide new or revised individual station
one-lines of all substations that include generators participating in the RealTime Energy Market regardless of voltage level. One-lines shall depict all
equipment, including equipment nomenclature, up to the point of
interconnection. New Generator Assets will initially provide their one-lines
through the ISO’s new generator coordination process. Those required to
submit their diagrams to the ISO web-based application will be identified
during the coordination meetings.

One-lines for stations or areas operating at voltages that are less than 69 kV
may be required when ISO determines that the one-lines are necessary for
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System. When required
by ISO, the TO or MP shall submit the one-line no later than thirty (30)
calendar days after ISO’s notification.

Required facility one-lines shall include all equipment that affects the flow of
system real or reactive power of equipment at voltages of 69 kV or greater or
between a generator and its point of interconnection. This includes switching
devices, transformers, phase shifters and reactive devices (shunt, variable or
dynamic) and the nomenclature for all such devices.

When it is necessary to provide a system overview one-line for the purpose of
satisfying the criteria for individual station one-lines, the system overview oneline shall be considered a required facility one-line and shall adhere to the
rules and submission schedule for required facility one-lines.

Optional facility one-lines:

Optionally, MPs and TOs may provide one-lines of substations with equipment
operating at voltages that are less than 69 kV and/or overview one-lines of any
kV level.

MPs and TOs are not expected to provide preliminary versions of optional

voltages of 69 kV or greater when the device affects connectivity and
system real or reactive power flow.
```
    o ISO groups devices into four main types: breaker, circuit switcher,

```
motor-operated switch and manual switch. Changes such as a
breaker type change from gas to oil do not affect the ISO device
type and are not required in advance of the change.

It is acceptable to provide a document with multiple diagrams outlining the
various project phases rather than multiple separate documents with various
effective dates as long as the diagrams in the document:

    - include all required devices and nomenclature; and

    - provide an estimated effective date for each diagram.


-----

When such a document is used, the user shall enter the expected effective
date of the final configuration as the expected effective date of the entire
document. When exercising this option, the diagram is required to be
submitted at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days in advance of the
expected In-Service Date of the first phase included in the document.

Preliminary one-lines are not required for the following changes to required
facility one-lines unless specifically requested by ISO:

    - A device type change that does not affect the ISO device type.
```
    o ISO groups devices into four main types: breaker, circuit switcher,

```
motor-operated switch and manual switch. Changes such as a
breaker type change from gas to oil do not affect the ISO device
type.

    - Changes (including additions or removals) to devices or equipment

operating at any kV level that do not affect the connectivity and system
real or reactive power flow at voltages of 69 kV or greater or between a
generator and its point of interconnection. This includes changes to
grounding devices, relay equipment, metering equipment, wave traps,
VTs, CTs, etc.

Preliminary one-lines can be based on preliminary, planned or MP or TO
specification data but shall include device nomenclature. This device
nomenclature shall be consistent with the nomenclature that will be used by all
station and system operators to identify equipment.

    - When uploading a preliminary one-line, the user shall enter the

expected effective date of the changes depicted on the preliminary oneline.

    - Users are not expected to update or maintain the expected effective

date of preliminary one-lines.

MPs and TOs shall provide any updated issued for construction one-line
schematic diagrams prior to the In-Service Date of the facility. One-lines shall
either be based on as-built or derived from the specification for construction.

As-built one-lines shall be submitted no later than thirty (30) calendar days
after the In-Service Date if not provided prior to the In-Service date.

Revisions to required facility one-lines not requiring submission of a
preliminary one-line shall be submitted within fifteen (15) Business Days of
being revised and re-issued by the participant.

Submission schedule for optional facility one-lines:

System overview one-lines, area one-lines and non-requested one-lines for
facilities connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV are not required to be


-----

submitted but can be helpful for ISO System Planning engineers and LCC
System Operators.[6] To this end, submission of these one-lines to ISO is
desired.

Once initially provided, MPs and TOs shall submit revisions to one-lines for
optional facilities no later than thirty (30) calendar days after being revised and
re-issued by the MP or TO.

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I

## 1. Introduction

This Appendix I to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical
Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related
Demands, and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14I) establishes
operating requirements for Continuous Storage Facilities (CSFs) as well as reporting
requirements under which CSF Operators shall submit data to ISO New England
(ISO). The submittal of such data supports the reliable and efficient integration of
energy storage into the ISO Balancing Authority Area (BAA). The requirements of
this OP-14I apply to all Resources registered as a CSF that are or will be:

(i) dispatched by ISO or

(ii) represented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS).

This OP-14I also includes requirements to submit data that will be integrated into the
ISO EMS in order to facilitate proper System Operator system awareness.

This OP-14I establishes data reporting and operating requirements specific to CSFs.
The CSF Operator shall also comply with any other requirements that apply to CSFs
under other ISO Operating Documents

## 2. Definitions

**NOTE**

Defined terms used but not defined in this OP-14I shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the ISO New England Transmission, Markets, and Services
Tariff or the Glossary of Terms Used in North American Electric Reliability
Corporation Inc. (NERC) Reliability Standards.

The following definitions are used for the purposes of this OP-14I:

**_Available Energy is the maximum MWh that a CSF could generate within a_**
specified amount of time based on its current equipment status and state of charge.

**_Available Storage is the maximum MWh that a CSF could consume within a_**
specified amount of time based on its current equipment status and state of charge.

**_CSF Operator is the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP), or its designee, who_**
operates a CSF or reports the CSF data to ISO as required in this OP-14I.

**_Facility Max Reactive Lagging Capability is the maximum reactive capability in the_**
lagging direction (i.e., VAr management that increases local voltage levels) that the
CSF can supply at the Point of Interconnection given the existing voltage, in a
continuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.

**_Facility Max Reactive Leading Capability is the maximum reactive capability in the_**
leading direction (i.e., VAr management that decreases local voltage levels) that the
CSF can absorb at the Point of Interconnection given the existing voltage, in a
continuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.

## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements

**3.1 CSF Data**

Unless ISO agrees to other modeling and data arrangements, CSF data (whether
static or telemetered) that a CSF Operator submits in accordance with this OP-14I
shall be consistent with the definition of a CSF.

**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**

A CSF shall be designed and operated (including the performance of re-closings
and restarts) by the CSF Operator in accordance with ISO Operating Documents,
which apply to all Resources within the ISO’s BAA.

If the CSF main breaker is opened (i.e., the Resource is manually or automatically
disconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission System), the CSF
Operator shall receive permission from ISO and the relevant LCC prior to reclosing
(i.e., reconnecting to the New England Transmission System). In other words, an
automatic restart of the CSF is not permitted following a fault to the Distribution
System or Transmission System that is severe enough to disconnect the CSF
(e.g., a low voltage ride-through event that is not “ridden-through”) or following any
CSF-wide out-of-service event.

**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**

Due to the very fast ramping capabilities of CSFs, there is potential for the
transmission equipment to which they are interconnected to become significantly
loaded or unloaded, which may lead to operational and reliability concerns. As
operational experience is gained, ISO shall evaluate and has the right to implement
ramp rate limitations on a CSF-specific basis, or to all CSFs in New England as
warranted. Where ramp rate limitations are applied, the specific CSF limits shall
be provided to the Lead MP.

## 4. Static Plant Data Requirements

The static plant data requirements in this section relate to the physical layout of the
CSF as well as data relevant to the design and operation of the CSF. The CSF
Operator shall provide this data and shall keep the data up-to-date by completing and
submitting the “CSF Static Data Information Form.” The “CSF Static Data
Information Form” is an editable Excel workbook file that shall be requested from,
and returned as a completed Excel workbook file to, the ISO at
RenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com. A sample “CSF Static Data Information Form”
is included as Attachment B to this OP-14I. Instructions are included on the form for
completing and submitting the required data. Attachment A to this OP-14I serves as
an aid to determining the inverter grouping. Consistent with Schedules 22 and 23 of
Section II of the Tariff and OP-14, the CSF Operator shall verify that the static plant
data for each CSF is kept current. The CSF Operator shall communicate any
material changes to the data to ISO as soon as practicable.

Static data:

1. Storage module type(s) and number(s)

2. Maximum storage nameplate capacity (in MWh to two decimal places)

3. Inverter type(s)

4. Maximum inverter nameplate capacity (in MW to two decimal places)

5. Inverter-by-inverter breakdown of relative storage MWh nameplate capacity

6. Descriptions of any permitting or administrative restrictions for the CSF or

any portion of the CSF, such as requirements to reduce or to cease power
production during certain hours or during certain events or weather
conditions.

## 5. Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer

This section establishes the Real-Time operational data requirements for CSF
Operators. In accordance with Table 6.1 of this OP-14I, and as detailed in Section V
(Internal New England Metering And Telemetering For Dispatch, Market, And
Reliability Purposes) of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 - Metering
and Telemetering Criteria (OP-18), data required under this Section shall be
electronically and automatically transmitted by the CSF Operator to ISO. In addition,
if any recommended data is provided by the CSF Operator, it shall also conform to
the requirements of OP-18. Reliable integration of CSFs into the Real-Time Energy
Markets is highly dependent on the availability of Real-Time power production,
status, and capability data. As such, the data provided shall be highly accurate and
reliable.

**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**

CSF Operators shall provide the Real-Time data collection points listed in Table 6.1
of this OP-14I that are identified as “Required.”


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I

Available Energy and Available Storage shall be calculated using a 15 minute, 1
hour, and 4-hour time horizon. These values should reflect the maximum energy
generation and consumption capability, respectively, that could occur during these
time horizons, subject to the current state of charge and taking into consideration any
power restrictions due to equipment, Interconnection Agreement limits, and energy
capabilities from any other on-site generation equipment (e.g. PV panels, wind
turbines, etc.) See Attachment C for example calculations.

**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points**

CSF Operators are requested to provide the Real-Time data collection points list in
Table 6.1 of this OP-14I that are identified as “Recommended.”

If the CSF includes any solar PV and/or wind generation (i.e. the solar or wind
generation is not a separately registered Resource for Real-Time Markets), static
and meteorological data from OP-14 Appendix H and/or OP-14 Appendix F
respectively, is requested in order to aid in the development and improvement of
centralized solar and wind power forecasts.

**Attachment C - Available Energy and Available Storage Calculation Examples**

The following examples are presented to illustrate how Available Energy and Available
Storage could be calculated under various conditions. These are only meant to illustrate
potential use cases that may occur and are not meant to capture all situations.

## Example 1:

The CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-1, with one
inverter module rated at 5 MW and one storage module rated at 20 MWh, but where the
last 1 MWh of energy will not be used for generation to avoid equipment degradation.
There are no more restrictive Interconnection Agreement power limitations and no onsite generation from other equipment. Inverter efficiency is 90%, meaning that for each
1 MWh of consumption, only 0.9 MWh is able to be stored.

The storage module currently contains 12 MWh of energy.

**Available** **Available**
**Time Horizon**

**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**

15 Minute 1.25 1.25

1-Hour 5.00 5.00

4-Hour 11.00 8.89

Explanation:

In 15 minutes and 1 hour, the CSF could generate or consume at full power without
running into the 1 MWh lower limit or completely filling the storage module at 20 MWh.
Therefore, the 15 minute Available Energy and Available Storage are both 1.25 MWh (5
MW * 15 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) and the 1 hour Available Energy and Available
Storage are both 5 MWh (5 MW * 1 hour). These are both examples of being power
limited; there is more energy stored (or remaining storage capability) at the facility than
could be utilized within these time horizons due to the size of the inverter module.

In 4 hours, the CSF could not generate or consume at full power without running into
the 1 MWh lower limit or completely filling the storage module at 20 MWh. Therefore,
the 4 hour Available Energy is 11 MWh (12 MWh currently available – 1 MWh reserved
to avoid equipment degradation) and the 4 hour Available Storage is 8.89 MWh (20
MWh total facility capability – 12 MWh currently stored) / 90% efficiency. In this case,
the 4 hour values are not power limited but rather, both are storage limited.

## Example 2:

The CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-3, with two
inverter modules and three storage modules but where storage modules 1 and 2 can
only be used by inverter module 1 and storage module 3 can only be used by inverter
module 2. Equipment capabilities and current storage levels are summarized in the

|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|

|1-Hour|5.00|5.00|

generation and consumption and no additional on-site generation.

15 Minute 2.50 2.50

1- Hour 10.00 9.89

4- Hour 15.00 9.89

Explanation:

Inverter module 1 has a total of 5 MWh available for generation and 7 MWh that could
be stored, which would require 7.78 MWh of consumption based on inverter efficiency.

Inverter module 2 has a total of 10 MWh available for generation and 2 MWh that could
be stored, which would require 2.11 MWh of consumption based on inverter efficiency.

In 15 minutes, inverter module 1 could generate at full power without running out of
storage (6 MW * 0.25 hours for 1.5 MWh). Inverter module 2 could also generate at full
power without running out of storage (9 MW * 0.25 hours for 2.25 MWh), however,
doing so would violate the Interconnection Agreement limitation of 10 MW maximum
power. Because there is enough energy to supply the inverters for 15 minutes, this
becomes power limited. At most, the facility could generate at 10 MW for the entire 15
minutes for a 15 minute Available Energy of 2.5 MWh (10 MW * 0.25 hours). There is
also enough capability to store more energy such that the facility could generate at the
full 10 MW allowed for the entire 15 minutes for a 15 Minute Available Storage of 2.5
MWh.

In 1 hour, the facility is able to generate at the Interconnection Agreement limit without
running out of energy, however it cannot consume at the full Interconnection Agreement
limit without running out of storage capability. 10 MWh could be generated and 9.89
MWh could be consumed within 1 hour.

|Inverter Group|Inverter Rating (MW)|Inverter Efficiency (%)|Storage Module|Storage Rating (MWh)|Current State of Charge (MWh)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Inverter module 1|6|90%|Storage module 1|7|4|
||||Storage module 2|5|1|
|Inverter module 2|9|95%|Storage module 3|12|10|

|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|
|---|---|---|
|15 Minute|2.50|2.50|
|1- Hour|10.00|9.89|
|4- Hour|15.00|9.89|


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I

In 4 hours, the facility is not able to generate or consume at full output without running
out of energy in all the storage modules or run out of storage capability. All 15 MWh of
energy could be used for generation within that time and the 9 MWh of storage
capability could be filled by consuming 9.89 MWh (7.78 in inverter module 1 and 2.11 in
inverter module 2)

## Example 3:

The CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-1, with one
inverter module rated at 5 MW and one storage module rated at 10 MWh, but
additionally with 3 MW nameplate of Solar PV-capability connected to the same inverter
module as the storage. There are no more restrictive Interconnection Agreement power
limitations and the inverter efficiency is 92%

The CSF Operator determines that the Solar PV output over the next 15 minutes, 1
hour, and 4 hour time horizons is expected to be 0.5, 1.2, and 4.6 MWh respectively
based on their solar PV forecast. The storage module currently contains 2 MWh.

**Available** **Available**
**Time Horizon**

**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**

15 Minute 1.25 1.25

1-Hour 3.20 5.00

4-Hour 6.60 8.70

Explanation:
In the next 15 minutes, 0.5 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site
PV. If put directly into storage (assuming 100% efficiency since the energy will not flow
through the inverter), there would be 2.5 MWh available for generation. Given the 5 MW
inverter rating, only 1.25 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time. During that
same time, if necessary the PV energy could be foregone to maximize the amount
consumed from the Interconnection, which, at full power, would be 1.25 MWh of energy.

In the next 1 hour, 1.2 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In
addition to the already 2 MWh in storage, this would result in 3.2 MWh of energy
available for generation. During that time, the facility could alternatively consume at full
power without filling up the storage for a 1 hour Available Storage of 5 MWh (5 MW * 1
hour).

In the next 4 hour, 4.6 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In
addition to the already 2 MWh in storage, this would result in 6.6 MWh of energy
available for generation. During that time, the facility could alternatively consume at full
power and fill up the storage at 10 MWh for a 4 hour Available Storage of 8.70 MWh (10
MWh storage capability – 2 MWh currently stored) / 92% inverter efficiency.

|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|
|---|---|---|
|15 Minute|1.25|1.25|
|1-Hour|3.20|5.00|
|4-Hour|6.60|8.70|


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I

## Example 4:

The CSF in this example is configured the same as Example 3 (5 MW inverter with 10
MWh of storage and 3 MW PV) above with the following difference – the solar PV
generation is participating as a separate market Resource and wants to operate the
CSF such that the storage can only be charged from the co-located generation and no
energy can be consumed from the Interconnection. There are no more restrictive
Interconnection Agreement power limitations and the inverter efficiency is 92%

The CSF Operator determines that the Solar PV output over the next 15 minutes, 1
hour, and 4 hour is expected to be 0.5, 1.2, and 4.6 MWh respectively based on their
solar PV forecast. The storage module currently contains 7 MWh.

**Available** **Available**
**Time Horizon**

**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**

15 Minute 0.75 0.50

1- Hour 3.80 1.20

4- Hour 7.00 3.00

Explanation:
Because the solar PV is now a separate market Resource, its expected generation
should not factor into the CSFs’ energy available for generation except to the point that
it might violate a combined equipment rating or Interconnection Agreement limit; it will
however impact the amount of energy available for the CSF to consume since it only
desired to do so from the solar PV.

In the next 15 minutes, even though there are 7 MWh available for generation, given the
5 MW inverter rating, only 1.25 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time.
Because the PV is expected to generate 0.5 MW during that time, the CSF cannot
generate more than 0.75 MWh without exceeding the inverter rating. During that same
time, since only 0.5 MWh of energy will be produced by the PV, that is all that would be
available to be put into storage without consuming from the Interconnection.

In the next 1 hour, even though there are 7 MWh available for generation, given the 5
MW inverter rating, only 5 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time. Given that
the PV is expected to produce 1.2 MWh during that time, only 3.8 MWh could be
generated from the CSF without exceeding the inverter rating. Based on the expected
amount of PV generation available, the facility could alternatively consume 1.2 MWh.

In the next 4 hour, 4.6 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In
addition to the already 7 MWh in storage, this would result in 11.6 MWh of energy
flowing through the inverter, which does not exceed its rating. Therefore, all 7 MWh of
the stored energy could be used for generation. During that time, the CSF could
alternatively store some of the PV generation. Because there are 4.6 MWh of PV
energy available but only 3 MW of storage capability remaining, the 4 hour Available

|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|
|---|---|---|
|15 Minute|0.75|0.50|
|1- Hour|3.80|1.20|
|4- Hour|7.00|3.00|

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I

Storage would be 3 MWh. Inverter efficiency wouldn’t apply since the PV energy would
be going directly into the battery rather than from the Interconnection.

operating parameters. All required data must be provided for each ATRR, as per
ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for
Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative
Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), Section III.D

Once an initial NX-12G has been provided, any change in ATRR data must be reported
to ISO via AskISO. The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) for the ATRR shall provide
an explanation and/or documentation to support the change request. The explanation
may be in the form of a verbal review with ISO or written documentation, as stipulated
by ISO. ISO shall review the supporting explanation and determine if the change
request will be accepted, denied, or if further modification or information is needed in
order to accept the change request

In order for an NX-12G form to be approved by ISO, all required data must be provided
without errors and without omissions. It is the responsibility of the Lead MP to correct
errors or omissions of NX-12G data and re-submit the corrected form to ISO. ISO will
be the sole judge of when NX-12G data is complete and correct. The effective date for
changes to NX-12G data items must be at least seven (7) days from the date that such
determination is made by the ISO that the NX-12G data is complete and without errors.

**SPECIFIC INFORMATION**

Section 1: Data Revision Information

This information includes the Data Revision Number, date prepared, name of person
who prepared the data, and requested effective date.

**Data Revision No. - The first time an NX-12G is filed by a Lead MP and approved**
by ISO, it must be assigned Data Revision Number 0. Each time revised data is
submitted and approved by ISO, the Data Revision Number must be incremented.
The revision number should only be incremented from one approved NX-12G to the
next approved NX-12G. In other words, if changes to an approved NX-12G are
desired and a new NX-12G form is submitted for approval, the data revision number
should be incremented. If, however, there are errors or missing data on that new
NX-12G form, another corrected form must be submitted by the Lead MP. This
corrected form should have the errors corrected and/or missing data provided, but
the Data Revision Number should be the same as on the previously submitted form.
The Data Revision Number is incremented only from one approved NX-12G to the
next approved NX-12G.

**Date Prepared - The date on which the NX-12G form is completed and submitted**
to ISO.

**Requested Effective Date - The date that the new NX-12G is to become effective.**
For a new ATRR, the effective date is to be at least One Hundred Twenty (120)
days following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives the NX-12G
(assuming that the NX-12G form and all other required data are complete and
without errors). For an existing ATRR, the effective date is to be at least seven (7)
days following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives the data
(assuming it is complete and without errors). If there are NX-12 G data errors or
omissions, subsequent submittals of corrected NX-12G data must have a
Requested Effective Date that is at least seven (7) days from the date that the
corrected NX-12G data is received by ISO.

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

## 1. Introduction

This Appendix H describes Solar Plant operating requirements and the data reporting
requirements that Solar Plant Operators shall submit to ISO New England (ISO).
The submittal of such data supports the operation of a centralized regional power
forecasting system and therefore, the reliable and efficient integration of solar power
into the ISO New England Balancing Authority Area (BAA). The requirements stated
in this Appendix H apply to all Solar Plants, not operating as part of a Continuous
Storage Facility (CSF), that will be or are dispatched by ISO and/or represented in
the ISO Energy Management System (EMS). Included also are requirements for
data that will be integrated into the ISO EMS in order to facilitate operator system
awareness.

Note that this Appendix H discusses Solar Plant data reporting and operating
requirements. To the extent that there are other operating, transmission service and
market requirements applicable to Solar Plants, the Solar Plant Operator must refer
to and comply with the applicable ISO New England Operating Documents.

The following examples were written primarily for solar Generator Assets that
produce energy using photovoltaic (PV) panels and inverters. If the solar Generator
Asset uses alternative technologies for converting solar insolation to electrical energy
delivered to the Point of Interconnection (POI), data requirements may be modified at
the discretion of ISO.

## 2. Definitions

The following are the definitions for terms used in this Appendix H:

**_Curtailment or Curtailed – Solar Plant Operator action (whether manual,_**
scheduled, or automatic), resulting from an ISO Dispatch Instruction, that limits the
amount of power produced by the Solar Plant to below the maximum amount of
power that could be produced by the normally operating available equipment given
the current weather conditions at the Solar Plant.

**_Met Gathering Station – a permanent purpose-built and/or sited station dedicated to_**
the collection of Meteorological Data.

**_Meteorological Data – the real-time data (e.g., Global Horizontal Insolation, Direct_**
Normal Insolation, wind speeds and directions) collected at a specific Solar Plant’s
location.

**_Plant Max Reactive Lagging Capability – the maximum reactive capability in the_**
lagging direction (i.e., VAr management that increases local voltage levels) that the
Solar Plant can supply at the interconnection point given the existing voltage, in a
continuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.

**_Plant Max Reactive Leading Capability – the maximum reactive capability in the_**
leading direction (i.e., VAr management that decreases local voltage levels) that the
Solar Plant can supply at the interconnection point given the existing voltage, in a
continuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

**_Plant Wind Directions – the instantaneous wind direction measured by wind_**
measuring equipment (e.g., wind vane).

**_Plant Wind Speeds – the instantaneous wind speeds measured by wind measuring_**
equipment (e.g. anemometry).

**_Real-Time High Operating Limit – is defined in the ISO New England Inc._**
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section I - General Terms and Conditions
(Section I).

**_Solar High Limit (SHL) – is defined in the ISO New England Inc. Transmission,_**
Markets, and Services Tariff Section I-General Terms and Conditions (Section I)
See Section 5.1.2 of this Appendix H and Attachment B hereto for more details
regarding SHL.

**_Solar Plant – for the purpose of this Appendix H, a Solar Plant is a collection of one_**
or more solar-collecting/electricity-generating equipment and the additional
equipment required to interconnect these collectors/converters into the electrical
power system, consistent with the definition of a Generator Asset in Section I.

**_Solar Plant Future Availability (SPFA) – is defined in the ISO New England Inc._**
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section I - General Terms and Conditions
(Section I).

**_Solar Plant Operator – for the purposes of this Appendix H, is the Lead Market_**
Participant (Lead MP), or its designee, who operates a Solar Plant and/or reports the
data to ISO as required in this Appendix H, as applicable.

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements

**3.1 Solar Plant Data**

Unless other modeling and data arrangements are agreed to by ISO, Solar Plant
data (whether static or telemetered) that is submitted by a Solar Plant Operator in
accordance with this Appendix H shall be consistent with the definition of Solar
Plant.

**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**

A Solar Plant shall be designed and operated (including the performance of reclosings and re-starts) by the Solar Plant Operator in accordance with ISO New
England Operating Documents, which apply to all resources within the ISO-NE
BAA.

If the Solar Plant main breaker is opened (i.e., the plant is manually or
automatically disconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission
System) the Solar Plant Operator must receive permission from ISO and the
respective LCC prior to reclosing (i.e., reconnect to the New England Transmission
System). An automatic restart of the Solar Plant is not permitted following a fault
to the Distribution System or Transmission System that is severe enough to
disconnect the Solar Plant [e.g., a Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) event that is
**not “ridden through”] or following any Solar Plant-wide out-of-service event.**

**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**

Due to the very fast ramping capabilities of Solar Plants, there is potential for the
equipment with which they are interconnected, to become significantly loaded or
unloaded. This condition may lead to operational and reliability concerns, therefore
ramp rate limits have been determined as described below. As operational
experience is gained, ISO shall reevaluate these limits on either a Solar Plant-bySolar Plant basis, or as applied to all Solar Plants in New England, as warranted.
Where alternative ramp rates are determined to be acceptable on a Solar Plantspecific basis (e.g., for the provision of ancillary and/or essential reliability
services), those plant-specific limits shall be provided to the Lead MP by ISO.

      - For Solar Plants totaling 200 MW or less in nameplate, under all conditions

except for emergencies and decreasing solar conditions, a default
maximum ramp rate of 20 MW/min averaged over five minutes is not to be
exceeded unless otherwise requested by ISO.

      - For Solar Plants totaling greater than 200 MW in nameplate, under all

conditions except for emergencies and decreasing solar conditions, a
default maximum ramp rate of 10% of nameplate per minute (in MW/min)
averaged over 5 (five) minutes is not to be exceeded unless otherwise
requested by ISO; see example below.

## 4. Static Plant Data Requirements

The static plant data requirements that describe the physical layout of the Solar Plant
and any associated meteorological equipment as well as data relevant to the design
and operation of the Solar Plant are listed below. This data must be maintained and
submitted by the Solar Plant Operator to ISO using the Solar Plant-Static Data
Information Form. The Solar Plant-Static Data Information Form is an editable Excel
workbook file and must be requested from ISO, completed, and returned as an Excel
[workbook file to the ISO at RenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com. A sample Solar](mailto:RenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com?subject=Solar%20Plant%20Static%20Data%20Form%20Request)
Plant-Static Data Information Form is available to in Attachment A of this Appendix H.
Instructions are included, on the form, on how to complete and submit the required
information. Consistent with ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and
Services Tariff Section II - Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) Schedules 22
and 23, and OP-14, the Solar Plant Operator shall verify that the static plant data for
each Solar Plant is kept current and changes are communicated to ISO if any data
point changes in a material fashion.

Static plant data requirements:

1. Solar Plant:

1. Latitude, Longitude, and elevation above sea level (in meters to one decimal

place) of polygon corners determining spatial location of the solar project
using WGS84 DD-MM-SS.SS using GPS WAAS, or comparable,
methodology

2. Solar module type(s) and model number(s)

3. Panel tilt angle(s) – if fixed-axis, or indication of tracking along this axis

4. Panel azimuth angle(s) – if fixed-axis, or indication of tracking along this

axis

5. Total MW DC Nameplate Capacity

6. Total MW AC Nameplate Capacity

7. Inverter module type(s) and model number(s)

8. Inverter-by-inverter breakdown of relative DC nameplate feed

9. Location and types of weather measurement devices (e.g., pyranometer

type & manufacturer) and manufacturer’s data specification sheets

10. High and Low temperature cutoff threshold(s)

11. High Wind Speed cutout threshold(s) and behaviors

12. Descriptions of any permitting or administrative restrictions for the Solar

Plant or any portion of the Solar Plant such as requirements to reduce or to
cease power production during certain hours or during certain events or
weather conditions.


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

13. For model training purposes, the ISO or its designee may require that any

available historical information regarding plant power output, plant
meteorological conditions, and conditions that may have caused power
output to be below theoretical maximum power output given the
experienced insolation, which are required by the solar power forecaster, be
provided.

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

## 5. Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer

This section presents the real-time operational and meteorological data requirements
for Solar Plant Operators. In accordance with Table 6.1 to this Appendix H, data
required under this Section must be electronically and automatically transmitted by
the Solar Plant Operator to ISO as detailed in OP-18 section V - Internal New
England Metering And Telemetering For Dispatch, Market, And Reliability Purposes.
In addition, if any recommended (i.e. not required) data is provided by the Solar Plant
Operator, it must also follow the same OP-18 requirements. Solar power forecasting
accuracy is highly dependent on the availability of the real-time meteorological,
power production, and status data for tuning the forecaster models. As such, this
required information must be provided with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.

**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**

_5.1.1 Meteorological Data_

Ambient air temperature, ambient air pressure, ambient air relative humidity, solar
irradiance, wind speed, and wind direction must be measured, at a minimum, at one
location within the Solar Plant (preferably as near to the capacity-weighted centroid
of the Solar Plant as possible) whose height above ground may be in the range of 2
m to 10 m and the measurement height above must be stated to within 10 cm.

Solar irradiance, wind speed and wind direction measuring equipment (e.g.
pyranometry and anemometry) should be mounted in, on, or near the Solar Plant
with reasonable attempt to minimize the effects of obstruction. Wind direction should
be calibrated for True North equal to 0 degrees and reported between 0 degrees and
359.9 degrees

_5.1.2 Solar High Limit_

The Solar High Limit of a Solar Plant should be calculated as follows:

When a Solar Plant is not being Curtailed, its Solar High Limit shall be calculated
equal to the net generation.

When a Solar Plant is being Curtailed, its Solar High Limit shall be calculated
equal to the Solar Plant’s possible power production given current sun/weather
conditions and equipment status if the curtailment were not in place. This will be
greater than the net generation.

(See Attachment B to this Appendix H for additional guidance and examples).

_5.1.3 Real-Time High Operating Limit_

A Solar Plant Real-Time High Operating Limit (RTHOL) is the maximum power
production (MW) the Solar Plant would be capable of in real-time, given ideal sun
conditions and no Curtailment. (See Attachment B to this Appendix H for additional
guidance and examples).

RTHOL should not be impacted by less than ideal sun conditions (e.g. cloudiness),
or time of day (e.g. before the sun has risen, or after the sun has set), except if the
Solar Plant is disconnected based upon a day/night cycle. If the Solar Plant is
disconnected solely because of day/night cycle, the RTHOL should be set to zero but


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

an outage is not required pursuant to OP-5.

When snow, ice, or other materials are fully or partially covering the PV panels, the
RTHOL should be reduced to reflect the generation capability given those conditions.
If panels are unable to produce energy given the conditions, it should be reported
equivalent to a full or partial outage as applicable.

_5.1.4 Solar Plant Future Availability_

Solar Plant Future Availability is equivalent to the future hour’s expected RTHOL and
should therefore be calculated using the same methodology as RTHOL but with the
expected equipment status for the hour being calculated.

In contrast to all other Real-Time data which is provided to the ISO via telemetry,
Solar Plant Future Availability is provided to the ISO using the ISO-NE Wind and
Solar Integration web services. In the future, once a solar power forecast can be
developed, this web service could also be used to gather solar plant power forecasts
provided by the ISO-NE solar power forecaster. Information on using the web service
platform, including data specification and sample files are available in the following
Zip file: https://www.iso-ne.com/static[assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sam](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)
[ple_files_AssetID_change.zip](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)

**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points and Practices**

In order to ensure that data of a high quality will be incorporated into the centralized
forecasting system, ISO requests that Solar Plant Operators follow the practices for
meteorological data collection for each Solar Plant as outlined below:

1. Collect and provide to ISO, Meteorological Data from at least one met station

that is strategically placed or utilized so that it will be impacted to a minimal
extent by plant operations.

2. The Met Gathering Station equipment should be located at well‐exposed sites.

It is recommended that each solar panel in the Solar Plant should be within 5
km of a Met Gathering Station.

3. In order to avoid outage of data, it is recommended that additional “backup”

data collection sites are selected in addition to the required data specified in
Section 5.2.1.

4. The method(s) of measuring solar irradiance (e.g. Global Horizontal

Irradiance, Direct Normal Irradiance, etc.) should be identified to the ISO
during the data collection points setup so they can be utilized properly within
forecasting systems.

**Attachment B – RTHOL and SHL Calculation Examples**

The following examples are presented to illustrate how RTHOL and SHL would be
calculated under various conditions.
Solar irradiance values in the following examples are assumed to be constant.
Variability of solar conditions will likely introduce some error into the calculation of SHL;
this is expected. Losses between the Solar Plant and the Point of Interconnection (POI)
are not taken into account in these simplified examples, but should be in the SHL
calculation such that the SHL reports the net power injection at the POI rather than the
gross production.
The following Solar Plant is used within all subsequent examples:

A Solar Plant has three strings of solar panels each connected to dedicated inverters as
follows:

**String** **Solar Panel** **Solar Panel Capacity** **Inverter Rating** **Inverter**

**#** **Type** **[MW DC]** **[MW AC]** **Efficiency [%]**

1 A 5 3 95

2 B 4 3 95

3 C 3 2 97

Each solar panel type can produce power according the amount of solar irradiance as
follows:

|String #|Solar Panel Type|Solar Panel Capacity [MW DC]|Inverter Rating [MW AC]|Inverter Efficiency [%]|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|A|5|3|95|
|2|B|4|3|95|
|3|C|3|2|97|

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H

## Example 1:

Solar irradiance is measured to be 500 W/m[2] by the pyranometer in the Solar Plant. All
three strings are fully available.

**Individual String Details**

Power % DC Inverter AC Inverter

String # Available [DC Panel ] based on Potential Efficiency Potential Capability

Capacity

irradiance MW MW MW

1 Yes 5 50% 2.5 95% 2.375 3

2 Yes 4 45% 1.8 95% 1.71 3

3 Yes 3 60% 1.8 97% 1.746 2

Total 12 6.1 5.831 8

**Solar Plant Totals**

ISO Provided Generation Limit None

Net Generation: 6.0 MW

RTHOL: 8.0 MW

SHL: 6.0 MW

Explanation:

Based on the solar irradiance, the % of DC Panel Capability can be determined. With
that value determined, it can be used to calculate the DC Potential MW. Applying the
Inverter Efficiency, the AC Potential MW values are calculated. For all three strings, it
can be seen that no Inverter Capability is violated. The RTHOL is the maximum output
that could be achieved given available equipment. In this case that is 8 MW (limited by
the Inverter Capability). The Solar High Limit is 6.0 MW because the Solar Plant is not
Curtailed and therefore SHL equals net generation. If the Solar Plant were curtailed to 4
MW based on an ISO Dispatch Instruction, the SHL would be 5.831 MW, based upon
the AC Potential MW of each string, adjusted for losses.

## Example 2:

Solar irradiance is measured to be 800 W/m[2] by the pyranometer in the Solar Plant.
String 3 is unavailable due to maintenance on the inverter.

**Solar Plant Totals**

ISO Provided Generation Limit 4.5 MW

Net Generation: 4.4 MW

RTHOL: 6.0 MW

SHL: 5.736 MW

Explanation:

With String 3 unavailable, its capability is excluded from all calculations. Values for
String 1 and 2 are determined in a similar manner as in Example 1, however, in this
example it can be seen that String 1’s AC potential MW capability exceeds the inverter
rating. The RTHOL would be 6 MW (limited by inverter capability). Because of the 4.5
MW limit provided by the ISO being below what the Solar Plant would otherwise be
capable of producing, the Solar Plant is Curtailed and the SHL is therefore 5.736 MW (3
MW from String 1 limited by the inverter and 2.736 MW from String 2 limited by the
panels)

**General Information**

The NX-12E Asset Related Demands Technical Data form (NX-12E) provides ISO New
England (ISO) with needed data that is not part of Offer data. All required data shall be
provided for each defined Asset Related Demand (ARD), per Section IV & V of ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand
Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation
Resources (OP-14).

Once an initial NX-12E form has been provided, any change in ARD data shall be reported
to ISO via Ask ISO.

In order for ISO to approve an NX-12E form, all required data shall be provided without
errors and without omissions. The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) shall correct errors or
omissions of NX-12E data and re-submit to ISO. ISO, at its sole discretion, shall determine if
the NX-12E data is complete and correct. The effective date for changes to NX-12E data
items shall be at least seven (7) days from the date when ISO determines that the data is
complete and correct.

When requested to select from a list of items, please indicate your selection by entering an
“x” in the appropriate space on the NX-12E form.

**Lead Market Participant - an ARD Lead MP [which is defined in Section I.2.2 of the ISO**
New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff)].

**LP ID - the Customer ID, as assigned to each entity at the time of Customer Registration, as**
defined in ISO New England Manuals and Procedures

**Local Control Center The Local Control Center (LCC) with TOP responsibilities for the**
transmission system where the Generator is interconnected.

**ARD Name - the name of the Asset** to be used for Asset registration.

**Asset ID - the ARD Asset ID assigned to the Asset by ISO Participant Support & Solutions at**
the time of the Asset’s registration, as defined in ISO New England Manual for Market Rule 1
Accounting, Manual M-28 (Manual M-28)

**Specific Information**

Section 1: Data Revision Information

This information includes the Data Revision Number, date prepared, name of person who
prepared the data, and requested effective date.

**Data Revision No. - the first time a Lead MP submits an NX-12E form and ISO**
approves it, it shall be assigned Data Revision Number 0. Each time the Lead MP
submits revised data and ISO approves it, the Data Revision Number shall be
incremented. The revision number shall only be incremented from one approved NX12E to the next approved NX-12E. In other words, if changes to an approved NX-12E
are needed and a new NX-12E form is submitted for ISO’s approval, the data revision
number shall be incremented. If, however, there are errors or missing data on the new
NX-12E form, then the Lead MP shall submit another corrected form. This corrected
form shall have the errors corrected and/or missing data provided, but the Data
Revision Number shall be the same as the one on the previously submitted new form.

**Date Prepared - the date on which the Lead MP submits the NX-12E form to ISO.**

**Requested Effective Date - the date when the new NX-12E form is to become**
effective. For a new unit, the effective date is to be at least one hundred twenty (120)
days following the date on which the designated recipient at ISO receives the NX-12E
form (assuming that the NX-12E form and all other required data are complete and
correct). For an existing Asset, the effective date is to be at least seven (7) days
following the date on which the designated recipient at ISO receives the data (assuming
that the form is complete and correct). If there are errors or omissions on an NX-12E
form, subsequent submittals of corrected NX-12E forms shall have a Requested
Effective Date that is at least seven (7) days from the date on which ISO receives the
corrected NX-12E form.

**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

Data for all transformers designated as part of the Bulk Electric System[1] (BES) or
with at least one winding connecting to the New England Transmission System[2] at
a voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the Transmission Owners and
Market Participants who own the equipment.[3]

     - Data for all generator step-up transformers (GSUs) attached to generators 1

MW or greater that participate in the Real-Time Energy Market, including
generators connecting via a line of any voltage level that is dedicated solely
to the generation interconnection (i.e., via an express feeder), will be
evaluated for impact to the ISO EMS Network Model. Based on this
evaluation, NX-9B data forms may be required. When required, the NX-9B
data forms shall be provided by the Lead MP for the Generator Assets.

     - NX-9B data forms are not required for GSUs that connect a generator to the

transmission system via a line(s) that also serves customer load.

     - NX-9B data forms are not required for GSUs associated solely with

Settlement Only Generators.

NX-9B data forms for transformers or individual wind turbine or solar GSUs
connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV may be required when ISO
determines that the data is necessary for reliable operation of the New England
Transmission System. When required by ISO, the TO or MP shall submit the data
within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s notification.

A separate NX-9B form shall be provided for each transformer. All data items shall
be completed for each winding unless these instructions specifically indicate
otherwise.

A copy of the manufacturer’s nameplate, either by document (.pdf format) or digital
photograph (.tif or .jpg formats), shall be included as a file attachment to the NX-9B
form for new or replaced equipment.

A copy of the manufacturer’s test report document (in .pdf format) shall be included
as a file attachment to the NX-9B form for all new or replaced equipment and upon
revision of existing NX-9B forms for transformers whose low voltage connection is
69 kV or greater.

1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section

I.2.2.

3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners

(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants
for Generator Assets (collectively MPs).

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

The NX-9B form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot
be modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for
all non-ISO fields via the NX Application.

The circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment
and thereafter maintained by ISO.

Select the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment. Terminals
are created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO NX-9
[Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)
needed.

To remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service
checkbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is
retiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to a
change in configuration.

All voltage data item responses are to be in kV unless otherwise indicated in these
instructions.

To assist in completing the NX-9B form, sample manufacturer's nameplate data
and completed NX-9B forms utilizing that data are attached.

Example 1: Fixed Tap Transformer

Example 2: Generator Step-Up (GSU) Transformer

Example 3a and 3b: Tap Change under Load (TCUL) Three Winding Transformer
(developed using the same nameplate data)

3a - TCUL Three Winding Model: Transformer with tertiary loaded.

Any 3-winding transformer whose tertiary winding connects to a generator, a
transmission bus, a sub-transmission bus, a distribution bus or a
capacitor/reactor bank should be modeled consistent with Example 3a. This
example assumes the tertiary is connected to a capacitor bank.

3b - TCUL Two Winding Model: Transformer with tertiary not loaded.

Any 3-winding transformer whose tertiary winding is not loaded should be
modeled consistent with Example 3b. If the total station service load served
by one or more tertiary windings is less than 1 MW, then the transformer
shall be modeled consistent with Example 3b.

If the total station service load served by one or more tertiary windings is greater
than 1 MW, then the MP or TO shall confirm with ISO whether the transformer
should be modeled consistent with Example 3a or 3b.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

All tap position item responses shall indicate tap positions using numbers (1, 2, 3,
4, etc.) as opposed to letters (a, b, c, d, etc.). See examples 3a and 3b where tap
positions designated by letter on the nameplate sheet have been designated by
number on the sample NX-9B forms.

**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Facility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures
for Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”
(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0
Collaborative Development of Rating Procedures. Additional information regarding
the rating of GSU Transformers and Load Serving Transformers exists in PP7
Appendix D, Power Transformers, Section 3.0 Application Guide. A facility rating
shall equal the rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay
loadability limits[4], and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave
traps and any other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary.
This requirement does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4,
and it successor standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay
setting to create a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.

The NX-9B form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)
and winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings as well as ratings for
special conditions or configurations. The ambient temperature (reported in
Fahrenheit) used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating
set. If ratings for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9B form,
comments that describe the associated circumstances for use of the special
ratings are required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement
as to the authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and
distribution of these special ratings.

**IV.** **CHARACTERISTIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**

Complete the following fields as instructed below:

Nameplate kV – Provide the transformer voltage rating for utilized connections as
listed on the nameplate document.

Impedance Data – Provide the positive sequence resistance (R) and reactance (X)
calculated at the kV of the no load tap position in use for the fixed tap, and the
Nameplate kV on the tap change side, in percent on a 100 MVA base. Do not
adjust values to nominal system voltage. Impedance on new or revised NX-9B
forms shall be calculated and provided out to at least the 3[rd] decimal place.

4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay

acts.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

For transformers with different fixed normal tap settings at Heavy and Light
Load, provide the impedance calculated at the Heavy Load fixed tap setting.

For transformers whose test report does not provide impedance at each tap,
provide the impedance at the closest tap for which impedance is provided
on all new or revised NX-9B forms. Provide a statement in the Equipment
Notes field of the NX-9B form indicating the tap position at which the
impedance is calculated.

Impedance data for three (3) winding transformers being modeled consistent with
Section I Example 3a should be submitted using a wye configuration. Refer to
diagram below.

Impedance data for three (3) winding transformers being modeled consistent with
Section I Example 3b should be submitted in two (2) winding format.

Transformer Type – Enter the type of the transformer based upon the descriptions
below:

GSU – Generator Step-Up transformer.

FIXED – Transformer without a load tap changer (LTC). Tap changes for
these transformers typically require the transformer be out of service.

TCUL-Non Auto – Transformer has an LTC but it is disabled.

TCUL-Auto[5] – Transformer has an enabled LTC.

Normal Operating Mode – For a TCUL-Auto type transformer, enter the normal
operating mode based upon the descriptions below. The normal operating mode
selected should reflect the operational state that the transformer is expected to be
in the majority of the time.

If the operational mode is dependent upon local generation, load level or other
system condition, provide this information in the Equipment Notes field of the
NX-9B form (example: transformer is operated in automatic mode when generator
XYZ is offline or when load level is above xx mw). The Normal Operating Mode
field shall still reflect the operational state that the transformer is expected to be in
the majority of the time.

5 The term TCUL-Auto as used in this appendix, represents a transformer with an enabled LTC that may or may

not be an autotransformer. An autotransformer has only a single voltage winding which is common to both
primary and secondary.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

Manual-Local – LTC is operated locally at the substation.

Manual-Remote –Tap changes are made using the SCADA system and are
manually initiated by an LCC System Operator[6] or a TO control room
operator remotely.

Auto – Transformer has enabled controls for automatic operation that allow
the equipment to respond to a contingency, typically within 2 minutes,
without manual intervention. Tap changes for normal operation occur
without LCC System Operator or TO control room operator intervention.

Tap Switching Time Delay – For a TCUL-Auto type transformer with the Normal
Operating Mode field set to Auto, enter the tap switching time delay in seconds.

Voltage Schedules – Voltage schedule data is required for all TCUL-Auto
transformers with Auto and Manual-Remote control types and is optional for
transformers with the Normal Operating Mode field set to Manual-Local. Voltage
schedule data is not accepted for GSU, Fixed and TCUL Non-Auto transformers.

        - The Controlled Winding and Controlling/LTC Side Winding flags shall be

set when entering voltage schedule data.

         - Typically a transformer operates to the same schedule in both on peak[7]

and off peak[8] hours so the prevalent schedule shall be entered as both
on and off peak in the voltage schedule table. If a transformer operates
to a different schedule during on-peak and off-peak hours, the different
schedules shall be entered in the voltage schedule table and a brief
explanation shall be provided in the Equipment Notes field describing
how the voltage schedule is modified in the field.

        - A transformer with the technology to use SCADA to modify the

programmed target voltage shall enter the single most prevalent
scheduled voltage and minimum/maximum voltage range for both on and
off peak and shall provide all other minimum, scheduled and maximum
settings available in either the Equipment Notes field or as a file
attachment (referenced in the Equipment Notes field).

TCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to Auto
(voltage schedule data is required):

         - Schedule data entered in the voltage schedule table shall equal the field

programmed target voltage and the minimum and maximum voltages
shall equal the control bandwidth settings from the field.

6 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.
7 On-Peak is from 0700-2300 on weekdays that are not NERC holidays.
8 Off-Peak is from 2300-0700 on weekdays, all weekends and NERC holidays.

-----

TCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to
Manual-Remote (voltage schedule data is required):

     - The voltage schedule data entered shall equal the most prevalent target

voltage and range used by the operators.

     - If there is no typical voltage schedule or range used by the operators:
```
      o Enter a scheduled voltage that matches the overall area voltage

```
profile and/or any nearby regulating devices such as generators,
STATCOMs or synchronous condensers.
```
      o Enter a generic 100% and 105% of nominal system voltage for the

```
minimum and maximum voltages.

TCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to
Manual-Local (voltage schedule data is optional):

     - If the optional voltage schedule data is provided, it shall equal the most

prevalent target voltage and range used by the operators.

     - If there is no typical voltage schedule or range used by the operators:
```
      o Enter a scheduled voltage that matches the overall area voltage

```
profile and/or any nearby regulating devices such as generators,
static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) or synchronous
condensers.
```
      o Enter a generic 100% and 105% of nominal system voltage for the

```
minimum and maximum voltages.

Heavy/Light Load Normal Tap - This is required for all windings with taps. Enter
zero (0) for windings without taps.

For the purposes of this document, heavy load shall mean the summer
months of June through August and light load shall mean the remaining
calendar months of January through May and September through
December.

For no load windings with fixed tap positions - Enter the seasonal no load
tap position (position number) as the normal tap number for each load
period.

For other windings with fixed tap positions - Enter the fixed tap position
(position number) as the normal tap number for each load period.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

For LTC windings on TCUL-Auto transformers (the Normal Operating Mode
field is set to Manual-Local, Manual-Remote or Auto):

       - Enter the typical heavy load tap position as the normal tap number for

both load periods.

       - If no typical heavy load tap position exists, enter the tap number

corresponding with the nameplate voltage of that winding as the
normal tap number for both load periods.

Step Size (per unit) – Enter the step size for each winding (per unit). This data can
usually be taken from the manufacturer’s nameplate information and should be
calculated as follows. Enter zero (0) for windings without taps.

Step Size = (maximum voltage - minimum voltage)

(nameplate voltage)(# of taps - 1)

Nameplate Tap Number – Enter the tap number for each winding at which
nameplate voltage is achieved. Enter zero (0) for windings without taps.

Minimum Tap No. – Enter the tap number for each winding at which minimum kV is
achieved. Enter zero (0) for windings without taps.

Minimum kV – Indicates the voltage of the windings when at minimum tap position.
Value is calculated based on nameplate voltage and associated tap number,
minimum tap number and step size.

Maximum Tap No. – Enter the tap number for each winding at which maximum
voltage is achieved. Enter zero (0) for windings without taps.

Maximum kV – Indicates the voltage of the windings when at maximum tap
position. Value is calculated based on nameplate voltage and associated tap
number, maximum tap number and step size.

Controlled and Controlling/LTC Side Winding (TCUL-Auto transformers only):

These fields are required for all TCUL-Auto transformers with the Normal
Operating Mode field set to Auto or Manual-Remote.

These fields are required for transformers with the Normal Operating Mode field
set to Manual-Local when the optional voltage schedule has been entered.

Select with a (√) the Controlled Winding (the winding for which desired
voltages/voltage schedules are established).

**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**

Any time an NX-9B form is modified or created, a brief description of the reason(s)
for the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will provide a
written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in
the field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9B form. For
example: Tap information corrected to match nameplate.

This data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9B form review and approval process.

**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**

The Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other
pertinent or operational information. For example: This transformer is operated in
automatic mode when generator XYZ is offline or when load level is above xx MW.

For transformers that are part of a dynamic reactive device control scheme, a brief
description of the control scheme is required to provide clarity regarding the
manner in which the transformer is operated.

Fields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is
available to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only by
the MP or TO owning the record.

Equipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9B form is updated. MPs and
TOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer
pertinent. ISO is responsible for maintaining ISO notes.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

The NX-12 Generator Technical Data form requests information needed by ISO New
England (ISO) to understand the Generator operating parameters. All required data
must be provided for each defined Generator, as per OP-14, Section II.A.

Once an initial NX-12 has been provided, any change in Generator data must be
reported to ISO via “Ask ISO”. The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) for the
Generator shall provide an explanation and/or documentation to support the change
request. The explanation may be in the form of a verbal review with ISO or written
documentation, as stipulated by ISO. ISO shall review the supporting explanations and
determine if the change request will be accepted, denied, or if further modification or
information is needed in order to accept the change request

In order for an NX-12 form to be approved by ISO, all required data must be provided
without errors and without omissions. It is the responsibility of the Lead MP to correct
errors or omissions of NX-12 data form and re-submit the corrected data to ISO. ISO
will be the sole judge of when NX-12 data is complete and correct. The effective date
for changes to NX-12 data items must be at least seven (7) business days from the
date that such determination is made by the ISO that the data is complete and without
errors.

When requested to select from a list of items, please indicate your selection by entering
an “x” in the appropriate space on the NX-12 form.

**Revision - Form revision identification and date of revision.**

**Lead Market Participant - The Lead Market Participant of a Generator as defined in**
Section I.2.2 of the Tariff.

**LP ID# - The Customer ID, as assigned to each entity at the time of Customer**
Registration, as defined in ISO New England Manuals and Procedures.

**Local Control Center - The Local Control Center (LCC) with TOP responsibilities for**
the transmission system where the Generator is interconnected.

**Generator Name - The name of the Generator must:**

   - Be unique to each Generators

   - Length cannot exceed 30 characters

**Generator ID - The Generator Asset ID, as assigned to each Generator at the time**
of Asset Registration Procedure, as defined in ISO New England Manuals and
Procedures.

**Designated Entity - Name of the entity, for the Generator, registered in accordance**
with ISO Manual M-RPA that receives, acknowledges, and responds to the ISO
dispatch instructions and communications. The DE name must:

   - Be unique

   - Not exceed 27 characters

**DE ID# -** The unique identification number, for each DE, assigned by the ISO at the
time of Registration, done in accordance with ISO Manual M-RPA


-----

**SPECIFIC INFORMATION**

Section 1: Data Revision Information

This information includes the Data Revision Number, date prepared and requested
effective date.

**Data Revision No. - The first time an NX-12 is filed by a Lead MP and approved by**
ISO, it must be assigned Data Revision Number 0. Each time revised data is
submitted and approved by ISO, the Data Revision Number must be incremented.
The revision number should only be incremented from one approved NX-12 to the
next approved NX-12. In other words, if changes to an approved NX-12 are
desired and a new NX-12 form is submitted for approval, the data revision number
should be incremented. If, however, there are errors or missing data on that new
NX-12 form, another corrected form must be submitted by the Lead MP. This
corrected form should have the errors corrected and/or missing data provided, but
the Data Revision Number should be the same as on the previously submitted
form. The Data Revision Number is incremented only from one approved NX-12 to
the next approved NX-12.

**Date Prepared - The date on which the NX-12 data is completed and submitted to**
ISO.

**Requested Effective Date - The date that the new NX-12 is to become effective.**
For a new Generator, the effective date is to be at least One Hundred Twenty (120)
days following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives the NX-12
(assuming that the NX-12 form and all other required data are complete and
without errors). For an existing Generator, the effective date is to be at least seven
(7) business days following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives
the data (assuming it is complete and without errors). If there are errors or
omissions of NX-12 data, subsequent submittals of corrected NX-12 data must
have a Requested Effective Date that is at least seven (7) business days from the
date that the corrected NX-12 data is received by ISO.

delivered to the onsite storage. Select one of the following from dropdown:

1. Conveyor
2. Pipeline
3. Railroad
4. Truck
5. Barge

**Maximum Onsite Storage Capacity - The highest amount of storage capacity for**
the Alternate Fuel measured in tons or barrels based on the Fuel selected.

**Maximum Usable Fuel Amount - The highest amount of Alternate Fuel usable**
from the onsite storage for the Generator

**Shared Onsite Storage Indicator- Alternate Fuel - Indicates whether the**
Alternate Fuel onsite storage is shared by other Generators.


-----

**Fuel Switch:**

1. Preparation Time - Primary to Alternate:

For Generators with both a Predominate and Secondary Fuel, identify the
advance notice time (in Hours) necessary to perform the fuel switching
operation including the swap time. For Generators with a single fuel, leave
this field blank.

This transition is from full load on Primary Fuel to dispatchable on
Alternate Fuel. This time value is entered regardless of whether the
Generator can or cannot perform an online fuel switch.

2. Preparation Time - Alternate to Primary:

For Generators with both a Predominate and Secondary Fuel, identify the
advance notice time (in Hours) necessary to perform the fuel switching
operation including the swap time. For Generators with a single fuel, leave
this field blank.

This transition is from full load on Alternate Fuel to dispatchable on
Primary Fuel. This time value is entered regardless of whether the
Generator can or cannot perform an online fuel switch.

3. Online Fuel Switch Capable:

Defines whether a Generator can perform the fuel switching operation,
from primary to secondary fuel source, while online and synchronized to
the grid.

    - Yes would indicate that the fuel switch could be done while the

Generator is online and synchronized, even if a slight reduction in
output is necessary to perform the fuel switch.

    - No would indicate that the Generator must be taken offline (non
synchronized to the grid), perform the fuel switch, and then be
resynchronized to the grid.

**Capabilities - Select Y (Yes) or N (No) from the dropdown menu:**

1. Blackstart Capable

Indicates that a Generator has the physical ability to Blackstart (starting
without outside electrical supply). All Generators with this capability must
select this indicator in the NX-12 Generator Technical Data Form. This is
an indication of physical capability only and does not imply or convey
approval, acceptance or contractual obligation for supply or compensation
under Schedule 16 of the OATT.

2. Electronic Dispatch Capable:

Indicates the Generator has Electronic Dispatch Capability and is able to
receive dispatch instructions via an ISO Communications Front End (CFE)
connected Remote Terminal Unit (ISO-connected RTU).

3. Do Not Exceed Dispatchable:


-----

Indicates the Generator operates under Do Not Exceed Dispatchable
guidelines as specified in the Tariff.

4. Fast Start Capable:

A Generator with the ability to operate with all of the following
characteristics:

a. Minimum Run Time does not exceed one hour;
b. Minimum Down Time does not exceed one hour;
c. Time to start does not exceed 30 minutes after receiving a Dispatch

Instruction from ISO;

d. Available for dispatch and manned or has automatic remote dispatch

capability;

e. Capable of receiving and acknowledging a start-up or shut-down

dispatch instruction electronically.

5. Auto Start Capable

Any Generator that is configured such that the START / STOP /
EMERGENCY / NORMAL signal delivered to the ISO-connected RTU is
electronically transferred to the generation plant control equipment. The
plant control equipment is then capable of:

**NOTE**

It is not acceptable for the Generator RTU to directly provide the ACK
response to an ISO START/EMERGENCY signal. The ACK must come from
the Generator generation control computer and be passed to the Generator
RTU, which then passes it back to the ISO CFE.

This capability requires prior written approval from ISO before being accepted
on NX-12.

The Auto Start Capable Flag shall be “N” for Intermittent Power Resources and
Continuous Storage Facilities.

a. Sending an electronic acknowledgement signal back to the ISO
connected RTU indicating it has acknowledged the
START/EMERGENCY request and

b. Will physically start and operate the Generator autonomously without

any user interaction.

c. It will then follow the specified DDP target automatically and

continuously.

The chain of electronic communication is:

ISO CFE  Generator RTU  Asset generation control computer

6. Regulation Capable

This indicates that a Generator has the appropriate telecommunications,
control and response capability to increase or decrease its output in
response to an electronic regulating control signal, in accordance with the
specifications in the ISO Manuals and Operating Procedures.


-----

Section 3: Physical Generator Capabilities

1. Nameplate Capability

The maximum rated output of the Generator Asset, in MVA, under conditions
specified by the manufacturer.  Installed Generator nameplate capability is
typically indicated on a nameplate physically attached to the Generator. For a
Generator Asset comprised of multiple units, enter the sum of the nameplate
capabilities of the individual units. Typical nameplate values are given at 59
degrees F, 1 atmosphere pressure and 60% relative humidity.

2. Rated Power Factor

Values submitted on the most recent approved and implemented
Interconnection Agreement with ISO. (e.g., a Generator rated at 100 MVA and
required by Interconnection Agreement to have a 0.95 lagging power factor and
a 0.95 leading power factor would have lagging 95 MW -31 MVAr, leading 95
MW -31 MVAr)

3. Minimum Manual Load Point

The minimum generation amount, in net MW, specified by the manufacturer, for
a Generator to remain stable for an extended period of time. For a Generator
Asset comprised of multiple units, this is the lowest value required for any
individual unit that is capable of operating without the support of another unit
(e.g., combustion turbine on a combined cycle plant). In the event that multiple
units must be run (e.g., steam cannot be dumped or bypassed on a combined
cycle plant), this is the lowest output for the combined units. This is a reliability
declaration, not a Market declaration and will not be considered or used for
Market operations.

4. Minimum Permitting-Restricted Load Point

The minimum generation amount, in net MW, required for a Generator to meet
any regulatory requirements (e.g., emissions, minimum flow restrictions, etc.).
For a Generator Asset comprised of multiple units, this is the lowest value
required for the Generator Asset. This is a reliability declaration, not a Market
declaration and will not be considered or used for Market operations. For
Generators with no permitting restrictions, this value would be equal to the
Minimum Manual Load Point. For ambient limited Generators, provide the value
at 59 degrees F, 1 atmosphere and 60% relative humidity.

5. Network Resource Capability

Enter the net Network Resource Capability for each season. The Network
Resource Capability can typically be found in the governing Interconnection
Agreement and is fully defined in the Section II.48 of the OATT as the maximum
net megawatt electrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of
Interconnection.


-----

**Winter Network Resource Capability - The maximum net megawatt**
electrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection at
an ambient temperature at or above 0 degrees F.

**Summer Network Resource Capability - The maximum net megawatt**
electrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection at
an ambient temperature at or above 50 degrees F.

If the Network Resource Capability is only specified in the governing
Interconnection Agreement as a total for a Generating Facility that includes
multiple Generator Assets, the sum of the Network Resource Capabilities of the
individual Assets may not exceed the total Network Resource Capability
specified in the Agreement.


-----

Section 4: Additional Information Required for Gas Turbine and Combined Cycle
Assets Only

For Claimed Capability Audit (CCA) purposes, ISO must adjust or normalize the output
of a gas turbine and combined-cycle Assets to the standard 90° (summer) and 20°
(winter) temperatures upon which Claimed Capability for such a unit is based. Lead
MPs submitting an NX-12 for such a unit must include a table reflecting the full range
(100° - 0°F, in one degree increments) of temperature versus MW output for that unit.
The MW output values in this table must be reported to three decimal places.

The table of temperature versus output MW values in Section 4 should be
representative of the expected relationship between ambient (or inlet) temperature and
MW output of the Generator. The table values are expected to reflect the
manufacturer-supplied relationship between temperature and output for the Generator.
The MW output values at 90°F and 20°F do not necessarily have to match the current
respective summer and winter SCC values. All temperature adjustments made to
demonstration values to normalize MW output to the standard at 90°F and 20°F
temperatures will be performed using current approved Table 4 values on the NX-12
form.

Section 5: Additional Information

List any additional information regarding the Generator that is not previously detailed in
this form or the Offer Parameters

-----

**Automatic Load Restoration**

No Underfrequency Load Shedding (UFLS) entity within New England shall use
automatic Load restoration that operates within one (1) minute of island formation and
subsequent UFLS activation. “Load” under this requirement refers specifically to Load
included in the entity’s UFLS plan. The owner of equipment designed and
implemented to perform automatic load restoration shall notify ISO New England
(ISO) of its operating time upon request from ISO during the annual UFLS survey.

**Automatic Switching of Capacitor Banks, Lines and Reactors**

At this time, the ISO UFLS program does not require Transmission Owners (TOs) to
provide automatic switching of their existing capacitor banks, transmission lines, or
reactors.

**UFLS Aggregated Reporting**

ISO has identified three (3) UFLS islands for applying the New England UFLS
program:

1. Maine portion of the Maine-Maritimes

2. Connecticut

3. All of New England

ISO only permits aggregation of UFLS programs for actual load shedding for entities
with service territories that are within the same identified UFLS island and that are
electrically close. If further information on aggregating is required, contact ISO
Participant Support.

ISO shall approve any aggregated reporting.

**Compensatory Load Shedding**

In accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No.14 – Technical
Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related
Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), non-nuclear
Generators that trip above the generator under-frequency curve included in the
effective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC shall, as described in
that NERC standard, either modify their protection settings to no longer trip above the
curve or use compensatory load shedding of an amount equal to the Generator’s
Summer Seasonal Claimed Capability (SCC) if the protection settings cannot be
modified. Documentation regarding underfrequency trip setting constraints shall be
provided to ISO as described in the effective version of PRC-006-NPCC and UFLS
collection schedule in Table 1.

Generators using compensatory load shedding should provide SCC and expected
station service load megawatt (MW) amounts to TOs or Market Participants.


-----

Compensatory load shedding must be in the same under-frequency island as the
generation and must be electrically close. ISO shall approve of compensatory load
shedding applications. For further discussion of compensatory load shedding refer to
PRC-006-NPCC.

As described in NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC, nuclear generators that
trip above the generator underfrequency curve are not required to provide
compensatory load shedding.

**UFLS Program Parameters, Tolerances and Exceedances/Deviations**

The New England UFLS program uses the UFLS parameters and generator
underfrequency trip settings listed in the effective version of NERC Reliability
Standard PRC-006-NPCC.

Each Distribution Provider (DP) or TO that must arm its load to trip on underfrequency
in order to meet its requirements, as specified, and that, by doing so, exceeds the
tolerances and/or deviates from the number of stages and frequency set points of the
UFLS program as specified in the tables included in the effective version of NERC
Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC depending on its total peak net Load shall:

   - Inform ISO of the need to exceed the stated tolerances or deviate from the
number of stages, and frequency setpoints as shown in Attachment C, Table 1
included in the effective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC.

   - Provide ISO with a technical study that demonstrates that the DPs or TOs
specific deviations from the requirements of Attachment C, Table 1 included in
the effective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC will not
have a significant adverse impact on the BES.

   - Inform ISO of the need to exceed the stated tolerances of the effective version
of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Attachment C, Table 2 or Table
3, and in the case of Attachment C, Table 2 only, the need to deviate from
providing two stages of UFLS, if applicable.

   - Provide ISO with an analysis demonstrating that no alternative load shedding
solution is available that would allow the DP or TO to comply with the effective
version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC, Attachment C Table 2
or Table 3.

In regard to the requirements on UFLS program tolerances or stages, if an UFLS
entity determines that exceedances or deviations exist, then that entity shall initiate
the process of providing a corrective action plan for addressing the exceedances or
deviations to the UFLS program tolerances or stages.

For entities whose system peak loads vary between the tables, or load is reduced to
below the UFLS program amounts shown in the tables contained in the effective
version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC (e.g., 25 MW), then load shall
vary accordingly for two consecutive years prior to changing to another table or
discontinuing a UFLS program.


-----

**Inhibit Settings**

ISO requires voltage inhibit settings to be at or below 0.7 per unit. Current and time
inhibit settings are unique and generally used to coordinate distributed generation. If
ISO coordination of settings is required, then this is done through individual
discussions with entities using current and time inhibit settings.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes standards for the installation and testing for
Market Participants (MPs)/Transmission Owners (TOs) that control
transmission/distribution facilities with voltage reduction and load shedding capability.
These standards require that all MPs/TOs that have control over
transmission/distribution facilities have the capability to reduce load demand when
directed to do so for Bulk Electric System (BES) dispatching purposes. ISO New
England (ISO) and/or the Local Control Centers (LCCs) use this load reducing capability
to maintain system reliability during generating capacity deficiencies, energy
deficiencies, and other emergency operating conditions described in ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4) and ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7).


-----

g p y

**II.** **COMPLIANCE**

MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities shall comply with the
standards established by this OP. MPs/TOs not in compliance shall immediately take
actions to achieve compliance.

A MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities may achieve compliance
by arranging with another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities to
provide on its behalf, voltage reduction and/or load shedding capability. The voltage
reduction and/or load shedding capability provided by such arrangements shall be in a
similar electrical location to the MP/TO for which service is provided. Such
arrangements shall yield equivalent support to transmission system load and voltage as
would be obtained if the MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities had
installed voltage reduction and load shedding capability on its own system.

Arrangements may also be made for one (1) MP/TO with control over
transmission/distribution facilities to provide voltage reduction and/or load shedding
capability for another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities during
a portion of the day or week. For example, an MP/TO with control over
transmission/distribution facilities not able to reduce voltage or shed load during the
entire period of time that such capability is required may arrange for another MP/TO
with control over transmission/distribution facilities, subject to the requirements of the
previous paragraph, to provide such capability on its behalf during the deficient periods.
A MP/TO providing voltage reduction and/or load shedding capability for another MP/TO
with control over transmission/ distribution facilities shall not count the capability
dedicated to another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities toward
meeting its own requirements.

The details of arrangements between MPs/TOs with control over
transmission/distribution facilities for voltage reduction and/or load shedding services to
meet the standards of this OP must be submitted to and approved by ISO.

A MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities that is not a Participating
Transmission Owner, as that term is defined in the Transmission Operating Agreement,
shall establish all necessary arrangements with an appropriate LCC to facilitate the
implementation of ISO directives with respect to voltage reduction or load shedding.

**III.** **REQUIREMENTS**

**A. Voltage Reduction**

1. Voltage reduction shall take place on the distribution system wherever possible.

It is recognized that in certain areas, voltage reduction is implemented on the
subtransmission system. Voltage reduction shall not be implemented on the
transmission system operating at 69 kV and above.

2. Ideally, voltage reduction capability shall be installed so that all loads are subject

to a five (5) percent voltage reduction. However, it is recognized that it may not
be practical to subject some loads to voltage reduction (e.g., loads served from
the transmission system, voltage sensitive loads, etc.). It may be desirable to
subject some loads to a voltage reduction of less than five (5) percent. However,
each MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities shall have the
capability to reduce system load demand at the time a voltage reduction is
initiated by at least one and one-half (1.5) percent through implementation of a
voltage reduction.

3. It is intended that voltage reductions be fully implemented within ten (10) minutes

from the time ordered. However, it is recognized that it may not be practical for
some MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities to meet this
requirement. In those circumstances, voltage reduction that can be implemented
in thirty (30) minutes is permissible.

4. Each MP/TO responsible for providing voltage reduction capabilities within ten

(10) minutes shall make this capability available for use seven days a week
during the period between 0800 to 2300 hours.

5. Each MP/TO responsible for providing voltage reduction capabilities that require

longer than ten (10) minutes shall be able to implement this voltage reduction on
all non-holiday weekdays during the period between 0800 to 2300 hours.
Holidays are those listed in Appendix A to this OP.

6. Upon application to and approval by ISO, the requirement for voltage reduction

capability may be satisfied by an equivalent amount of interruptible loads. Such
loads shall be interruptible within ten (10) minutes of issuance of ISO’s voltage
reduction operating instruction. Loads designated for this purpose shall be
dedicated to OP-4, shall be under dispatch authority of ISO and/or the
appropriate LCC, and do not qualify as Demand Response Resources or Asset
Related Demands under the provisions of ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response
Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation
Resources (OP-14).

**B. Load Shedding**

1. In accordance with the provisions of the NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006
NPCC – Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding, each Distribution Provider
(DP)/Transmission Owner (TO) with 100 MW or more of peak net Load shall
implement an Underfrequency Load Shedding (UFLS) program with attributes
that include load shedding stages, frequency setpoints, block sizing, and total
operating times as detailed in Attachment C, Table 1 of PRC-006-NPCC.

All DPs/TOs with 50 MW or more and less than 100 MW of peak net Load shall
implement a UFLS program as prescribed in Attachment C, Table 2 of PRC-006NPCC.

All DPs/TOs with 25 MW or more and less than 50 MW of peak net Load shall
implement a UFLS program as prescribed in Attachment C, Table 3 of PRC-006NPCC.

DPs/TOs with less than 25 MW of peak net load connected to their facilities are
exempt from providing UFLS.

MPs/TOs may collectively implement and provide, by mutual agreement with one
or more DPs/TOs within the same island and acting as a single DP/TO, an
aggregated automatic UFLS program that sheds their coincident peak
aggregated net Load, based on the frequency thresholds, total nominal operating
time and amounts specified in PRC-006-NPCC, Attachment C, Tables 1 through
3.

Load shed automatically by underfrequency relays shall not be automatically
restored.

Under frequency threshold relays shall be set to a nominal total operating time of
300 ms, from the time when frequency passes through the set point to the time of
circuit breaker contact opening (including any communications time delay), with a
minimum relay operating time to be no less than 100 ms when the rate of
frequency decay is 0.2 Hz per second. This is consistent with the requirements
of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Attachment C.

2. Each MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities must be capable

of manually shedding at least fifty (50) percent of load in ten (10) minutes or less.
The first half of the load shed manually should not include load which is part of
any automatic load shedding plan unless following manual load shedding, the
requirements of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC - Automatic
Underfrequency Load Shedding, Attachment C can still be met.

3. Manual load shedding should not interrupt transmission paths. MPs/TOs with

control over transmission/distribution facilities that include such interruptions in
load shedding plans must demonstrate from system simulations that
transmission interruptions will not degrade interconnected system reliability.

4. Manual load shedding plans may incorporate the use of electronic notification

systems, outside of normal business hours, to notify MPs/TOs with control over
transmission/distribution facilities personnel that manual load shedding has been
requested. MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities whose


-----

g p y

plans include the use of such a system must coordinate those plans with the
appropriate LCC. In addition, MPs/TOs with control over
transmission/distribution facilities whose plans include use of an electronic
notification system will consider receipt of an Abnormal Conditions Alert, under
Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert
(M/LCC 2), as notification that their substations are to be staffed for possible
implementation of manual load shedding during the period that the Alert is in
effect.

This provision for the use of an electronic notification system is subject to review
by the Reliability Committee relative to the overall manual load shedding
capability of the New England Reliability Coordinator Area / Balancing Authority
Area (RCA/BAA) and the extent to which such systems are being used to provide
coverage outside of normal business hours. The compliance surveys performed
in accordance with Section IV of this OP will serve as the basis for such
Reliability Committee reviews.

5. The plan should include the capability of shedding load proportionately over the

whole system; however, it is recognized that this may not be practical in some
areas.

Generation connected to sub-transmission or distribution systems will have an
ever-increasing impact on load shedding plans. If a Generator is interrupted as
part of a load shedding plan by an MP/TO with control over
transmission/distribution facilities, an equivalent amount of additional load must
be included in the load shedding plans.

6. Each MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities must be capable

of implementing automatic and manual load shedding twenty-four (24) hours a
day.

7. Once manual load shedding has been implemented, the appropriate LCC will

inform the MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities of the
estimated length of time that the load is expected to be interrupted. Depending
on the time estimate, MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution
facilities may choose to initiate feeder rotations. During the rotation process,
load must be interrupted before an equivalent load can be restored.

g p y

**IV.** **TESTING**

**A. Voltage Reduction**

At the discretion of ISO, a system-wide voltage reduction test will be conducted. An
actual voltage reduction will be implemented. MPs/TOs with control over
transmission/distribution facilities will record the load reduction attained within ten
(10) minutes and/or thirty (30) minutes in the test. If such records are not possible,
LCC load relief data may be used. Each MP/TO with control over
transmission/distribution facilities will complete a questionnaire that will record load
relief attained and identify operational, or customer problems that were encountered
and should be resolved. The data will be used by ISO to update load relief
estimates contained in OP-4, and to help verify each MP/TO with control over
transmission/distribution facilities voltage reduction capability.
Voltage reduction tests will be conducted in accordance with the following
parameters:

1. A date will be established for the test.

2. MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities will be given a

written notice four (4) weeks in advance of the test date.

3. If system operating conditions force cancellation of the test, a new date will be

set in accordance with the above parameters.

**B. Load Shedding**

Every second month, ISO will conduct a simulated manual load shed test to train the
ISO, LCC, and MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities
personnel in all aspects of manual load shedding procedures. These tests will be
conducted in accordance with OP-7 to the maximum extent possible. Tests will
deviate from actual load shed operations in the following manner.

1. All verbal load-shedding operating instructions issued will be preceded and

concluded with the statement, “This is a test. Do not shed load”.

2. Operators will not open breakers or disconnect actual load, but instead, will

observe or estimate the amount of load that would have been shed on the circuit
had it been an actual load shedding operation. These tests may be used to help
verify an MP/TO with control over any transmission/distribution facility capability
to reduce system load by as much as fifty (50) percent.

3. Operators will report the amount of load that would have been shed and the

length of time to do it to their next highest dispatching authority. ISO will issue
reports on each simulated manual load shedding test. The report will specify the
amount of load relief attained and the time interval to attain the load shed during
the test.

### I. INTRODUCTION

Reactive capability (NX-12D) data defines and represents the physical characteristics and ratings of a
reactive device, including (but not limited to): Generators (as defined in ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 14 – Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset
Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14) ), Dispatchable Asset
Related Demands (DARDs), or other dynamic reactive devices (e.g., synchronous condensers or flexible
alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices) and is required by ISO New England (ISO)
and the Local Control Centers (LCCs) in order to develop accurate system models and to support the
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System. Each Market Participant (MP) is required to
provide this data through the ISO NX submittal software as described in this Appendix B to OP-14 (OP14B).

NX-12D data is required for each device that is located in the New England Reliability Coordinator Area
(RCA) and is either

i) part of a Generator, including generating facilities consisting of multiple generating units, where that

Generator has a total real power capability of at least 1 MW,

ii) part of a DARD that is contained within an Electric Storage Facility (ESF DARD),
iii) A shunt-connected dynamic reactive power device (e.g.., Static VAR Compensator (SVC), or

Synchronous Condenser), or

iv) is another type of dynamic reactive device for which ISO or the LCC requires and specifically

requests reactive capability data.

The MP may submit one set of representative reactive capability data, including the number of devices
installed, for electricity producing or consuming devices that:

i) use an inverter (e.g., photovoltaic, wind, etc.),
ii) are associated with the same Resource, DARD or other piece of dynamic reactive equipment; and,
iii) have the same Point of Interconnection.

NX-12D data may be required by ISO and the LCC for other dynamic reactive devices that support the
reliable operation of the New England Transmission System. Because the capabilities of these devices
may not match the descriptions in this OP-14B, ISO, the LCC, and the MP will work together to
determine how to accurately represent the reactive capability of these devices through the NX submittal
software.

The manufacturer nameplate lagging and leading reactive power (MVAr) output capability is based on
the design parameters of the equipment. This capability represents the theoretical maximum reactive
capability of a specific reactive device.

The manufacturer nameplate operating lagging and leading MVAr output capability may be limited during
normal operation by any one of several devices or considerations other than the manufacturer nameplate
capability curve. Examples of limiting devices include, but are not limited to, excitation limiters, electrical
protection relaying, and thermal protection relaying. Examples of limiting considerations include, but are
**not limited to, internal station voltage requirements, auxiliary equipment constraints, resource**
interconnection generator step-up transformer (GSU) overheating, fuel or prime mover limitations, and
contractual arrangements. When any such limitations are present, the equipment cannot operate at the
manufacturer nameplate reactive capability. This restricted capability represents the normal reactive
operating capability and, accordingly, it shall be included in the NX-12D data.

The MP shall report any change in the reactive capability of a device in Real-Time to ISO and the
appropriate LCC control room. If it is determined that the change will last longer than six (6) months,
then the MP shall update NX-12D data in the NX submittal software.

The MP shall verify all NX-12D data is accurate upon submittal and at least annually. ISO shall initiate,
and the MP shall respond to, the annual NX-12D data verification, which shall be performed through the
NX submittal software.

Appendix B

### II. DATA SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS

The MP shall submit NX-12D data through ISO NX submittal software under the following conditions:

1. Prior to ISO designating a Resource or ESF DARD as being ready to follow dispatch;
2. Prior to a dynamic reactive device being placed in service;
3. No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date when a determination is made by ISO or the MP
that the data contained in the NX submittal software is inaccurate; or,
4. No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of determination that a temporary modification to
a Reactive Resource with NX-12D data, that affects that Reactive Resource’s reactive capability, will be
in effect for longer than six (6) months.

Synchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual machines require
a separate NX-12D form for each machine and a separate NX-12D form for the composite Reactive
Resource.
Non-Synchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual pieces of
dynamic reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for each equipment type at the asset.
Reactive devices with multiple types of reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for the
composite asset. For example, a wind plant that is comprised of twenty-five (25) turbines from one (1)
manufacturer and twenty-five (25) turbines from another manufacturer would require two (2) separate NX12D forms (one for each unique machine type) and an additional NX-12D form that captures the entire
plant composite reactive power capability.

### III. DATA DETERMINATION FOR SUBMITTAL

**A. Prerequisites for filling out the NX-12D form**
The following are required in order for the MP to provide accurate data on the NX-12D form:

1. Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This curve is also referred to as the P/Q or

MW/MVAr curve. This curve is provided by the manufacturer of the reactive equipment and is a graphic
illustration of the reactive capability of a machine as a function of real power output or consumption. It
represents the physical limitations of that machine based upon design parameters. This curve shall be
uploaded to the application using the File Attachments tab. NOTE: If this curve is not available because
the manufacturer is out of business or other similar circumstance, the curve shall be created by the MP
using the best possible data for the resource capability.

2. Reactive Capability curve showing any limitations to the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This

curve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve. These limitations can include, but are not limited to:
under-/over-excitation, prime mover (maximum MW limit), and procedural limitations. This may be
provided by the manufacturer or may need to be created by the MP using all of the known limitations
overlaid onto the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This curve shall be uploaded to the
application using the File Attachments tab.

3. Voltage schedule or automatic voltage regulator exemption as provided by the Transmission

Operator.

### B. Theoretical and Tested Values

[The Theoretical and Tested Values section of the NX-12D data form is where MPs provide reactive ]

capability data that has been derived from the Nameplate Reactive Capability and Normal Operating
curves in order to discretely model those curves in ISO systems. In order to determine these discrete data
points, MW values are determined based upon manufacturer maximum MW value, minimum MW value,


-----

gy g

Appendix B

and certain other MW values that may be present on a given reactive capability curve. The MVAr values
that correspond to these MW values are then determined either graphically or mathematically from the
reactive capability curves.

   - These capability values represent gross reactive (MVAr) and real (MW) power as measured at the

equipment terminal prior to station service load.

   - Lagging (over-excited) capability is defined as the Resource providing reactive power to the electrical

system and is denoted as a positive value.

   - Leading (under-excited) capability is defined as the Resource absorbing reactive power from the

electrical system and is denoted as a negative value.

Figure 1 – Data Required for Theoretical and Tested Values

### 1. Synchronous Machines That Produce Real Power and Pump DARDs 

NOTE: Synchronous machines are considered any rotating machine that is electrically coupled to the

electrical system through an electrical generator.

The “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to “0” unless otherwise directed by ISO.

### a. Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Determination
The Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design
specifications of the equipment.  Figure 2 illustrates a typical Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a
sample synchronous machine at various hydrogen pressures when not encumbered by any protective or
limiting concerns. The sample synchronous machine is designed to operate at thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen
pressure. For equipment nameplate capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs for
nine (9) points along the capability curve (see, Figure 2).

**NOTE**

Some manufacturers provide a curve with lagging (over-excited) and leading (under-excited) axes
reversed (i.e. leading will be on the positive y-axis and lagging will be on the negative y-axis).

### (1) Nameplate Real Power Data Values

**i. General Instructions**

[(a) ] These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power

capability for Nameplate Reactive Capability or Normal Operating Curves.

(b) These MW values will be N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach that

MW value on the Normal Operating curve.

   - An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty (20) MVA but limited by the prime mover

capability of ten (10) MW. In this case, the machine cannot produce enough real power in order to
reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Points on the Normal Operating
curve.

(c) If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output,

the curve that most closely approximates forty (40) degrees Celsius (40[o]C) shall be used to determine
reactive capability.

(d) If there are multiple voltage-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves, the curve for 1.0 per unit

(p.u.) shall be used.

(e) Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MW values shall be N/A (if the Resource is part of a

storage facility, the reactive capability while consuming will be reported on a separate NX-12D form).

**ii. Nameplate Real Power Data Point Determination**

(a) Determine the Minimum Manual Load Point MW (see, Points 1 and 6 on Figure 2). This value:

  - is the lowest MW output at which the machine can produce both real and reactive power;

  - is a manufacturer-provided value;

  - shall be the lower of the summer and winter values if there are separate values; and

  - if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points.

(b) Determine the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point MW (see, Point 5 on Figure 2). This
value is the:

  - maximum real power capability of the machine at unity power factor, not taking into account any

limitations such as prime mover capability;

  - point where the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve crosses the zero (0) MVAr point; and

  - if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points.

(c) Determine the Intermediate Load Point MW (see, Points 2 and 7 on Figure 2). This is a calculated

value that is halfway between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity Generating Unit Power
Factor Load Point and is determined by the equation:

𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊

= 0.5 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡

  - This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the

machine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation.

  - This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual

Load Point are changed.

(d) Determine the Three Quarter Load Point MW (see, Points 3 and 8 on Figure 2). This is a calculated
value that is seventy-five percent (75%) between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity
Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point and is determined by the equation:

𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊

= 0.75 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡

  - This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the

machine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation.

  - This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual

Load Point are changed.

(e) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MW (See Point 4 Figure 2). This value:

  - is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

  - Is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where

there is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the field winding limit and stator design
limit;


-----

gy g

Appendix B

  - may be a different value than the Leading Break Point Load MW value;

  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and

  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot

reach the MW value in normal operation.

(f) Determine Leading Break Point Load MW (See Point 9 Figure 2). This value:

  - is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;

  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve

where there is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the stator design limit and the end
region heating limit;

  - may be a different value than the Lagging Break Point Load MW value;

  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and

  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot

reach the MW value in normal operation.

The Transitional Load Point MW values are determined by overlaying any limitations (e.g. over-/underexcitation limiters or turbine max power limits) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This
combined curve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve for the machine. Figure 3 illustrates a typical
Normal Operating curve for a sample synchronous generating unit at various hydrogen pressures when
that machine is limited by protective relaying or limiting concerns. The sample generating unit is designed
to operate at a thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen pressure level.

  - is determined by examining the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve;

  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where

the most limiting limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;

  - may be a different value than the Leading Transitional Load Point MW value;

  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve if there is no limitation or that limitation does not

intersect with the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; and

  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited such that the machine cannot

reach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

(h) Determine Leading Transitional Load Point MW (See Point 18 Figure 3). This value:

  - is determined by examining the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve;

  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve

where the most limiting limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;

   - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW-limited, such that the machine cannot

reach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

**(2) Nameplate Reactive Power Data Point Determination**

**i. General Instructions**

[(a) These values do][ not][ take into account any limitations (under-/over-excitation, prime mover (max P ]

limit), procedural, etc.) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

(b) The reactive power values may differ between Nameplate Reactive Capability curve values and

Normal Operating Curve values depending upon any machine limitations. The absolute value of the
Normal Operating curve MVAr values cannot be greater than the absolute value of the Nameplate
Reactive Capability curve MVAr values.

(c) These reactive power values will be N/A on the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach

the MW value on the Normal Operating curve. An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty
(20) MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of ten (10) MW. In this case, the machine cannot
produce enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load
Points.

(d) If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output,

the curve that most closely approximates 40 degrees Celsius (40[o]C) shall be used to determine reactive
capability.

(e) If there are multiple gas pressure curves, the curve that represents the machine’s normal operating

pressure shall be used.

(f) All values shall be in MW or MVAr. If the curve provided by the manufacturer is not in MW or MVAr,

these values shall be converted by the MP.

(g) Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MVAr values shall be N/A.

### ii. Nameplate Lagging Reactive Power Value Determination

(a) Determine the Lagging Minimum Manual Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over
excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual
Load Point MW value.

(b) Determine the Lagging Intermediate Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)

portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load Point MW
value.

(c) Determine the Lagging Three Quarter Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)

portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load Point
MW value.

(d) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of

the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Break Point Load MW value.
This point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.

(e) Determine Lagging Transitional Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)

portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Transitional Load
Point MW value. This point is N/A if there is no limitation or that limitation does not intersect with the
nameplate curve.

### iii. Nameplate Leading Reactive Power Value Determination

(a) Determine the Leading Minimum Manual Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under
excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual
Load Point MW value.

(b) Determine the Leading Intermediate Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under
excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load
Point MW value.

(c) Determine the Leading Three Quarter Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under
excited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load
Point MW value.

(d) Determine Leading Break Point Load MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under-excited) portion

of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Break Point Load MW value.
This point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.

(e) Determine Leading Transitional Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under-excited)

portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Transitional Load
Point MW value. This point is N/A if there is no limitation or that limitation does not intersect with the
nameplate curve.

### b. Normal Operating Capability Data Point Determination (1) Normal Operating Capability Real Power Values
(a) These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power capability

### 2. Non-Synchronous Machines That Produce Real Power and non-Pump DARDs

NOTE: Non-Synchronous machines are any machine that is electrically coupled to the electrical system
through power electronics. These machines include, but are not limited to, inverter-based resources.

The “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to the number of identical power producing pieces of equipment
at the asset. For example: a wind plant with ten (10) turbines would have “10” in the “Identical Unit Count” field
or a solar plant with one thousand (1000) inverters would have “1000” in the “Identical Unit Count” field.

### a. Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Point Determination
The Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design specifications of
the equipment.  Figure 3 illustrates a Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a sample non-synchronous
machine. A specific reactive capability curve for a non-synchronous machine may look different than the
example curve in Figure 3; however, the concepts for determining the MW and MVAr points are similar for all
types of curves. For equipment reactive power capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs
for eleven points along the capability curve (see, Figure 3).

Some manufacturers provide a curve with lagging (over-excited) and leading (under-excited) axes
reversed (i.e. leading will be on the positive y-axis and lagging will be on the negative y-axis).

maximum current limit;

**NOTE**

If the plant operator does not have Real-Time high side voltage reading, then the “High Side Visibility”

Check this box when the plant operator has, available in the control room, a Real-Time voltage reading
indicating the voltage on the bus for which the voltage schedule is provided that can be used as a
reference to make voltage control set-point corrections. This voltage reading would be comparable to
the voltage schedule provided by the LCC.

### 4. Voltage Schedule 

**NOTE**

For Resources with multiple pieces of reactive equipment aggregated behind a single Point of
Interconnection, the transformer at the Point of Interconnection for these Resources is the equivalent of
a GSU for conventional generators.
For wind, solar, or other plants that have geographically diverse generating or consuming pieces of
equipment with the same Point of Interconnection, the terminal voltage is the voltage at the terminals of
the generating or consuming equipment before any transformer/transformation to a different voltage
level (e.g., between a turbine and its GSU or between a solar inverter and the collector transformer).
For Option A units, the maximum and minimum acceptable voltage schedule limits will typically differ
from the more narrow voltage schedule tolerance bands as stated in ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control (OP-12), Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules
(OP-12B).
The ISO or the LCC may operate the station at more restrictive voltages due to transmission equipment
voltage limits.

## I. Introduction

A Market Participant (MP) may offer a resource to ISO as a potential Designated
Blackstart Resource (DBR). If the ISO and the System Restoration Working Group
(SRWG) determine that a resource could provide a potential benefit to the New
England System Restoration Plan, then the MP may need to perform a blackstart
capability conversion study and a blackstart conversion for that resource to become
a DBR.

If a blackstart capability conversion study is required, then ISO and the proposed
Blackstart Owner shall complete and sign Section II of this Appendix G to ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 11 (OP-11G), prior to commencement of the
blackstart capability conversion study. Following completion of the required
conversion study, if ISO accepts the proposed DBR and the proposed Blackstart
Owner decides to pursue blackstart conversion of the proposed DBR, then, prior to
commencing conversion, the proposed Blackstart Owner and ISO shall complete
and sign Section III of this OP-11G.

Following any required conversion or the determination by ISO and the SRWG that
the resource would provide benefit to the Plan if no conversion is required, the
proposed Blackstart Owner shall perform a successful Blackstart Capability Test on
the resource. ISO, upon notice of a successful Blackstart Capability Test for the
resource, shall coordinate with the Blackstart Owner to complete and sign Section IV
of this OP-11G. The Designated Blackstart Resource commitment for the resource
shall begin on the date indicated in the completed Section IV of this OP-11G.

## II. ISO and Blackstart Owner Commitment Prior to Blackstart
 Capability Conversion Studies

[Proposed Blackstart Owner] has offered [proposed Designated Blackstart Resource
name] to provide Blackstart Service in accordance with Schedule 16 - Blackstart
Service of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff. ISO has
determined that [proposed Designated Blackstart Resource name] meets the
transmission or distribution technical requirements of the ISO system restoration
criteria. [Proposed Blackstart Owner] has been authorized by ISO to conduct a
blackstart capability conversion study that will assess the viability of converting

[proposed Designated Blackstart Resource name] to be blackstart capable.

[Proposed Blackstart Owner] agrees to conduct the necessary study, provide,
periodic updates on the study progress and provide the final study results to ISO and
the SRWG.

## I. INTRODUCTION

**A. Background**

1. This Operating Procedure (OP) describes the minimum technical

requirements for defined generator units described in Section II.A.2 of this
OP which are referred to as “Generators” for purposes of this OP,
Settlement Only Resources/Generators (SOGs), Alternative Technology
Regulation Resources (ATRRs), Asset Related Demands (ARDs)[1],
Demand Response Resources (DRRs) and Continuous Storage Facilities
(CSFs) under the control/jurisdiction of ISO New England Inc. (ISO). For
the purposes of this OP, “under the control/jurisdiction of ISO” is defined
as:

a. an individual or aggregated asset/resource/unit/facility classification

meeting the technical criteria as stipulated in Sections II, III, IV, V, VI or
VII as applicable, or

b. is participating in the wholesale electric market.

2. This OP addresses technical requirements, and not the Offer Data

associated with these resources for submission to the New England
Markets, that may include parameters of a technical nature. This OP is
meant to assure, in conjunction with the market structures that the Bulk
Electric System (BES)[2] of the New England Reliability Coordinator
Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) conforms to proper standards
of reliability. This OP is also meant to establish technical requirements to
verify that each Generator, ATRR, ARD, DRR, and CSF has accurate
metered data available for ISO dispatch control and settlement.

**B. Standards**

1. Compliance with all applicable ISO OPs is the responsibility of the Lead

Market Participant (Lead MP) for the Generator, ATRR, ARD, DRR and
CSF. In the case of a Generator, the Lead MP as used in the ISO OPs is
the Lead MP for the Generator Asset and not the Lead MP for the
Generating Capacity Resource.

The Lead MP is responsible for identifying a Designated Entity (DE) or a
Demand Designated Entity (DDE), as applicable, for each of its resources.
The Lead MP shall identify a DE or DDE that has entered into either a
Market Participant Service Agreement (MPSA) or a DE/DDE Agreement
with the ISO. DEs/DDEs that have not entered into either an MPSA or a
DE/DDE Agreement with the ISO cannot be the DE/DDE for the Lead
MPs’ resource(s).A Lead MP is always ultimately responsible for all
requirements and obligations assigned to a DE or DDE that is performing
functions for that Lead MP. Each Lead MP shall also comply with all

1 This OP describes minimum technical requirements for Dispatchable Asset Related Demands (DARDs),

which are a subset of ARDs.

2 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards


-----

applicable Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) and North
American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) requirements. It is also
expected that all elements specified in this OP will be operated utilizing
Good Utility Practice including making resources available for service as
soon as possible after failures of equipment.

## II. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERATORS

This section describes the basic technical requirements that a Generator shall
meet to be considered for offer, dispatch and settlement. Generators shall also
meet the eligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO New England Inc.
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and ISO New England
Manuals (ISO Manuals) to offer into the New England Markets.

Criteria used to define registration options outlined in Section II.A.2 shall be used
for all generating facilities. All registered SOGs shall comply with the registration
requirements of Section II.A.2 of this OP on or before January 1, 2021.

**A. Generator Defined**

1. A Generator shall be defined consistently for all ISO applications for the

purposes of offer, dispatch and settlement. Defined Generators are
represented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS) and shall
communicate with ISO through its approved DE.

a. To define a new Generator, a minimum of one hundred and twenty

(120) calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required. To change
data for an existing Generator definition, a minimum of seven (7)
calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required. The advance notice
period commences upon ISO receipt of the data detailed in Section
II.A.6 of this OP.

2. Except as provided for in Sections II.A.3 and II.A.4 below, the registration

options for a generating facility are as follows:

a. A generating facility (of any size) interconnected at 115 kV or above

shall register as a Generator.

b. A generating facility of five (5) MW or greater interconnected below

115 kV shall register as a Generator.

c. A generating facility that is at least one (1) MW and less than five (5)

MW interconnected below 115 kV:
```
      o May register as a Generator
      o May register as a SOG or

```

-----

```
   o May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not

```
participating in any New England Markets other than as a load
reducer or regulation provider

d. A generating facility less than one (1) MW interconnected below

115 kV:
```
   o May register as a SOG or
   o May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not

```
participating in any New England Markets other than as a load
reducer or regulation provider

3. A generating facility that meets the Distributed Generation Definition:

  - May register pursuant to Section II.A.2 above

  - May register as a component of a DRR, On-Peak Demand Resource,

or Seasonal Peak Demand Resource or

  - May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not

participating in any New England Markets other than as a load reducer
or regulation provider

4. A generating facility that opts to register as part of an Electric Storage

Facility shall register as a Generator.

5. **Neither a Generator nor an SOG may be registered at the same end-use**

customer facility as a Demand Response Asset unless the Generator or
SOG is separately metered and reported and its output does not reduce
the load reported at the Retail Delivery Point of the Demand Response
Asset.

6. For the purpose of this OP, the aggregated maximum net output at or

above 0 degrees F and interconnection voltage of a generating facility
measured at the point at which the generating facility interconnects to the
existing system are used to determine registration options.

7. For dispersed power generating facilities or distributed energy resources

(excluding load reducers) that are interconnecting to the existing system
through a common point of connection (e.g., a common collector or an
express feeder), the following applies:

a. For purposes of this OP, a common collector is a system, usually

operating at distribution or sub-transmission voltage levels, designed
primarily for interconnecting capacity to a common point of connection
on an existing transmission or distribution element. Where the existing
point of connection is a substation, the interconnection facilities are
commonly referred to as an express feeder. An express feeder by
definition serves no load other than that associated with the


-----

interconnected dispersed power generating facilities or distributed
energy resource.

b. Where multiple dispersed power generating facilities or distributed

energy resources are connecting to the existing system through a
common point of connection at the same time, all generating
facilities/resources (excluding load reducers) interconnected at the
common collector or express feeder system will be aggregated for
the determination of the less than five (5) MW eligibility threshold.
However, a new dispersed power generating facility or distributed
energy resource seeking to interconnect at the same common
collector or express feeder system as other dispersed power
generating facilities or distributed energy resources will not be
aggregated for the purposes of determining the less than five (5)
MW eligibility threshold if both of the following conditions are met:

(1) the other generating facilities or distributed energy resources on

the common collector or express feeder system are existing,
which, for purposes of this OP means, with executed
interconnection agreements in place; and

(2) the new dispersed power generating facility or distributed

energy resource is not an Affiliate of the existing generating
facilities or distributed energy resources on the common
collector or express feeder system at the time of the
interconnection request submittal

c. The ISO may waive aggregation of an unaffiliated generating

facility/resource that would otherwise be aggregated pursuant to
Section II.A.2.f, if the ISO determines that not aggregating the
unaffiliated generating facility/resource is acceptable from a reliability
perspective.

(1) ISO shall consider project information included in the Generation

Notification Form or Proposed Plan Application submitted pursuant
to Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff to determine if multiple points of
connection are present.

8. A Lead MP may combine generator units to form a defined Generator

subject to Section II.C of this OP - Designated Entity - Performance,
Communication and Control. Examples of a defined Generator,
composed of multiple generator units, include: multi-unit hydro stations,
solar farms, wind farms and most combined-cycle units. A Lead MP’s
right to combine physical generator units to create a Generator for offer,
dispatch and settlement is governed by the following rules:

a. Generator units being combined shall either be at the same physical

site or be part of a project that, by its technical nature, requires
coordinated control of the various units being combined to form a
Generator.


-----

b. For a Generator that is a composite of multiple physical generator

units, only the defined Generator will be represented, acted upon or
allowed to transact in the various New England Markets.

c. ISO shall determine if generator units located on different electrical

buses may be combined and defined as a Generator.

d. ISO shall consider if such a combination of generator units interferes

with effective control of probable constraints or accurate determination
of system losses, Operating Reserve and Regulation capabilities. The
appropriateness of these combinations will be reviewed on a
continuing basis.

9. Price offers for generation supply shall only be submitted for a defined

Generator.

10. ISO shall only perform settlement functions for generation supply for

defined Generators and SOGs.

11. To define a Generator, the Lead MP shall submit any technical data with

respect to a Generator that ISO determines to be necessary for ISO to
carry out its responsibility of reliably and efficiently operating the power
system. The Lead MP shall submit the technical data for each physical
component of a unit regardless of it being modeled as a single unit or as
multiple aggregations of the physical components of the unit, such as is
the case with some hydro units and combined-cycle units. The Lead MP
shall submit and maintain all requested data for the Generator. A defined
Generator shall have an approved DE, provide all required data and have
all required communications equipment in place and tested in accordance
with ISO procedures prior to being available for dispatch. The Lead MP
shall identify the DE. The Lead MP shall communicate to ISO through the
identified DE for dispatch related matters. The data shall include, but may
**not be limited to, the following, as necessary:**

    - Form NX-12, Generator Technical Data (NX-12) per Appendix A of this

OP

    - Form NX-12D, Generator Reactive Data (NX-12D), per Appendix B of

Procedure No.18 - Metering and Telemetering Criteria (OP-18).

b. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) that control more than five (5)

dispatchable Generators must be reviewed and approved by ISO
Operations and must meet the requirements in OP-18 Appendix F,
Section 3.5.

c. For Generators that are participating in the Energy Market and/or are

dispatchable in Real-Time, communications equipment, hardware and
software sufficient to enable the DE to receive, acknowledge receipt as
necessary, and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions electronically
and, if necessary, verbally in a timely manner are required by ISO
Manuals and ISO New England Administrative Procedures


-----

(Administrative Procedures). Participation in the Energy Market and
Forward Reserve Market is conditioned upon having Electronic
Dispatch Capability (EDC) installed. EDC is the ability, through the
installation and maintenance of adequate hardware and software and
communications infrastructure within the Continental United States, to
provide for the electronic transmission, receipt, and acknowledgment
of data relative to the dispatch of Generators to carry out the RealTime dispatch processes from ISO issuance of Dispatch Instructions to
the actual increase or decrease in output of dispatchable Generators.
The hardware, software, and communications infrastructure may be
located outside the Continental United States if agreed to on a caseby-case basis by ISO. Generators are considered to have EDC when
they are capable of receiving, responding to, and changing output in
response to electronic Dispatch Instructions issued to the ISO CFE
connected RTU of the DE.

d. In the event of a failure of the ISO CFE connected RTU or the failure of

communications or other equipment between the ISO CFE connected
RTU and the Generators connected to the ISO CFE connected RTU,
the DE acting on behalf of the Lead MP shall convey the Dispatch
Instructions issued by ISO to the generating unit(s) impacted by the
equipment failure within the time and other constraints established by
ISO Manuals and OPs, and shall diligently pursue the repair and/or
replacement of failed facilities on an expedited basis.

13. Whenever a Lead MP seeks to establish or change the DE responsible for

managing dispatch for one or more of its Generator(s), the Lead MP and
DE are responsible for demonstrating to ISO that the proposed DE meets
the technical requirements set forth in this OP prior to the ISO approving
the proposed change(s) to become effective.

14. Generators shall provide and maintain up-to-date contact information to

the applicable Local Control Center (LCC).

**B. Telemetering and Revenue Metering**

1. Telemetering for the Generator shall meet the requirements for speed

and accuracy of OP-18. The Lead MP shall maintain and calibrate
telemetering on an ongoing basis pursuant to OP-18.

2. Revenue metering shall meet the requirements of OP-18. Meter readings

shall be forwarded to ISO for settlement, in a timely manner, as required
by ISO Manuals and Administrative Procedures. The Lead MP shall
maintain and calibrate revenue metering per the ISO requirements in OP18.

3. Metering requirements and modeling options in the EMS and market

systems for units less than five (5) MW will depend on their registration
choice:


-----

a. Each Generator that is represented in the EMS and market systems

shall meet the telemetering and revenue metering requirements
described in II.B.1 and II.B.2 above.

b. Each generating facility that registers as a SOG shall only meet the

revenue metering requirements described in II.B.2 above; there are no
telemetering requirements.

c. Each generating facility that is not registered does not need

telemetering.

**C. Designated Entity - Performance, Communication and Control**

DE Performance, Communication and Control for Continuous Storage
Facilities (CSFs) is governed by Section VII.B. For all other Generators:

1. Each DE shall provide dispatch services from a single physical location for

a defined Generator and shall be the single point of contact to receive,
acknowledge receipt, and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions and
related communications. If prior approval from the ISO control room has
been obtained, the operation from a single physical location allows for
exigent conditions, as well as for infrequent, periodic testing & training
needs.

- - **No entity shall be recognized as a DE unless the entity meets the**

requirements in this OP and has been registered pursuant to ISO MRPA.

      - All DE contact information shall be confirmed and/or updated by the

DE on an annual basis or upon change.

2. Each DE shall comply with all requirements of the ISO Operating

Documents to the same extent as if the Lead MP were carrying out the
functions of the DE.

3. ISO shall communicate with the DE via electronic dispatch through an ISO

connected RTU or voice communications through an automatic ringdown
telephone circuit or one of the dedicated 24x7 phone numbers identified
during DE registration in accordance with M-RPA.

4. The DE shall have the knowledge and authority to act on ISO Dispatch

Instructions for all ISO registered assets it manages for dispatch, as
defined in Section II.F of this OP - Dispatch Instructions.

Generator, from a remote location, shall meet the speed, accuracy and
data channel requirements set in OP-18. Such equipment shall be
maintained by the Lead MP according to ISO requirements contained
in OP-18 and ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 2 Maintenance of Communications, Computers, Metering and Computer


-----

Support Equipment (OP-2). ISO System Operators[6] shall be notified
as soon as practicable if the equipment is incapable of meeting the
requirements of OP-18. Steps shall be taken to restore the equipment
to normal operating conditions as soon as possible in accordance with
OP-2.

b. Each DE shall have, to the fullest extent possible, a dedicated voice

communication landline telephone system with an assigned public
switched network landline phone number for ISO dispatching
purposes. If the DE cannot procure a landline telephone system, then
an alternate or diverse method of communications, such as a cellular
telephone line with an assigned cellular phone number, shall be
provided, unless otherwise agreed to on a case-by-case basis by ISO.

5. In addition to the dedicated voice communication telephone, each DE is

required to have a dedicated automatic ringdown telephone circuit to the
ISO control room for any of the following unless ISO otherwise agrees on
a case-by-case basis.

    - Each DE managed dispatchable Generator or aggregate of

dispatchable generation greater than or equal to fifty (50) MW (net)

    - A Generator providing Regulation service

    - Other instances as determined on a case-by-case basis by ISO

Further, certain Generators are critical to the BES under emergency
conditions. These Generators are listed in Appendix D of this OP and
shall install, maintain, operate, test and fund a voice communication
system that is independent of the public switched network for the
purposes of communicating with its LCC during system emergencies
such as a system restoration event. The installation, maintenance,
testing and operation of the communications system shall be coordinated
with, and acceptable to, the LCC for that Generator. Each LCC, in turn, is
responsible for providing the requirements for the communications
system and coordinating with each applicable Generator to effect the
installation, operation and testing of the communications system.

6. Each DE for a Generator that participates in the New England Markets

shall have equipment capable of reliably receiving and acknowledging
receipt of Dispatch Instructions sent electronically by ISO as frequently as
necessary and to implement Dispatch Instructions in a timely manner as
required by ISO Manuals and Administrative Procedures.

7. Each DE shall display to their DE Operator, the following parameters for

each dispatchable Generator, as defined in Section II.A.12 of this OP, in
New England that is under their responsibility.

take precedence over all other forms of communication.

**D. Designated Entity - Modifying DE Details**

1. ISO shall evaluate all submitted DE change, registration or modification

requests according to the required lead times with the requirements stated


-----

in this OP. ISO shall coordinate with each applicable Lead MP,
transitioning DE, communication vendor, and any other authorized party in
order to process requests.

2. A Lead MP shall provide at least thirty (30) calendar days’ notice to

change the DE, as defined in M-RPA.

a. The effective date of the transfer is contingent on the proposed DE

meeting the technical requirements and being registered and approved
in accordance with M-RPA.

b. Change requests concerning the DE communications infrastructure,

moving the DE location, or changing the contact details shall only be

-----

**F. Dispatch Instructions**

Dispatch Instructions for Generators that are part of CSFs are governed by
Section VII.C of this OP. For all other Generators:

1. All Dispatch Instructions (Includes normal and emergency)

a. If a DE is not capable of controlling the delivery of energy in

accordance with its Offer Data, the DE shall notify the ISO System
Operators as soon as practicable. Efforts should be made to forecast
Generator capabilities based on daily local conditions and submit
those parameters appropriately.

2. Normal Dispatch Instructions

a. Normal Dispatch Instructions shall be transmitted electronically to each

DE every five minutes or less, depending on system conditions.

b. Manual acknowledgement of a normal Dispatch Instruction is not

required; however, compliance with the Dispatch Instruction shall be in
accordance with Offer Data without delay.

c. Fast Start Generators shall receive start-up and shutdown messages

which shall be acknowledged by the DE within sixty (60) seconds.
This acknowledgement requires physical action by staff at the DE.
This item may be waived on a case-by-case basis by the ISO.
Acknowledgement of a start-up or shutdown message shall indicate
the DE intent to immediately comply with the Dispatch Instruction.

d. Fast Start Generators shall not be shut down without receiving a

shutdown message. A DDP below the Economic Minimum Limit that is
**not accompanied by a shutdown message is considered a dispatch to**
the Generator Economic Minimum Limit.

e. Under normal Dispatch Instructions, voice communications to the ISO

control room related to the Dispatch Instructions should be limited to
only those pertaining to clarifying the Dispatch Instructions.

3. Emergency Dispatch Instructions

The requirements of this section are not applicable to DNE Dispatchable
Generators or CSFs as they do not receive Emergency Dispatch
Instructions.

a. Emergency messages will be issued by the ISO System Operators

when an emergency issue requires an immediate response by
Generators outside of the normal dispatch protocol.

b. Emergency Dispatch Instructions shall be transmitted electronically to

each DE every five minutes or less, depending on system conditions.


-----

c. Emergency messages shall be acknowledged by the DE within sixty

(60) seconds of receipt of the message. This acknowledgement
requires physical action by staff at the DE. This item may be waived
on a case-by-case basis by ISO. Acknowledgement of the emergency
message shall indicate the DE intent to immediately comply with the
Dispatch Instruction.

d. Emergency Dispatch Instructions shall be followed in accordance with

Offer Data without delay.

e. In an emergency, off-line Fast Start Generators that are called on to

start will receive an emergency message and a non-zero DDP in lieu
of a start-up message. The DDP that accompanies the emergency
message dictates the desired response from the Fast Start Generator.
The DE shall take action to comply with the Dispatch Instructions in
accordance with their Offer Data.

f. Fast Start Generators shall not be shut down without receiving a

shutdown message. A DDP below the Economic Minimum Limit that is
**not accompanied by a shutdown message is considered a dispatch to**
the Generator Economic Minimum Limit.

g. While the emergency message is active, voice communication to the

ISO control room related to the Dispatch Instructions should be limited
to only those pertaining to clarifying the Dispatch Instructions.

**G. Operational Considerations**

1. A Generator shall be dispatched as directed by ISO in accordance with

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1 - Central Dispatch
Operating Responsibilities and Authority (OP-1), and the operating
characteristics submitted by the Lead MP. The safety of operating
personnel and prevention of damage to equipment are the sole
responsibility of the Lead MP, and shall be the priority at all times.

2. Each Generator that is treated as a SOG may have additional

responsibility under ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action
During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4).

3. Both the Planned Outages and Maintenance Outages[7] of the Generator

shall be performed in accordance with ISO generator maintenance
scheduling procedures per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 Resource Maintenance and Outage Scheduling. (OP-5)

4. The Lead MP shall, at all times, comply with all applicable switching and

tagging procedures in effect by the authorities governing switching and
tagging operations in the field.

7 Planned Outage and Maintenance Outage are defined in OP-5


-----

**H. Voltage Control**

1. The MVAr production of a Generator is an important factor in the reliable

operation of the New England RCA/BAA. Each Lead MP for a Generator
interconnected at 69 kV or higher voltage shall support system voltage
and reactive needs at the direction of ISO and the LCC per OP-12. Each
Generator in the New England RCA/BAA normally follows a schedule of
bus voltages, which is specified for both On-Peak and Off-Peak[8] load
periods as contained in OP-12, Appendix B, or as otherwise specified by
ISO or an LCC. ISO and the LCC shall have the authority to direct the
Lead MP to deviate from the normal voltage schedule to address
operating situations. Each Generator shall participate, to the limit of their
capability as documented in its NX-12D and as summarized in OP-12,
Appendix B, and maintain their assigned voltage schedule as directed by
ISO or the LCC and to comply with any variations that ISO or the LCC
may request.

New generators subject to the ISO’s Interconnection Procedures shall
follow the AVR requirements of OP 14. New generators interconnecting
through a state interconnection process shall follow the AVR requirements
of the interconnecting utility. Existing generators (ranging from active
commercial generators to generators that have begun the system
interconnection study (study scoping has started) prior to the effective
date of Revision 34 of this procedure) interconnected at voltages below 69
kV which have AVR requirements due to OP-14 shall retain the need for
AVR control, unless the interconnecting utility exempts the generator from
the AVR obligation and such generator shall meet the voltage
requirements documented in its interconnection study.

2. The Lead MP shall keep and maintain an automatic voltage regulator

(AVR) in service and regulating to the voltage schedule on all generating
units comprising a Generator unless granted an exemption under the
provisions in Section 5 of Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 8 Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System
Stabilizer Outages (M/LCC 8). Generators that have applied for and
received an exemption shall be listed in M/LCC 8, Attachment A Generators Exempted From AVR Requirements.

3. Each Lead MP (except those for whom an exemption has been granted,

as described in Section II.H.2) shall maintain the AVR in good operating
condition.

4. Each Lead MP shall provide to ISO on ISO Form NX-12D - Generator

Reactive Data Form, in accordance with Appendix B of this OP,
information describing the periods of time when conditions occur (if any)
where the Lead MP routinely expects that its Generator will not operate
with the AVR in service and controlling voltage (such as during start-up or
shutdown).

8 On-Peak and Off-Peak are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards


-----

5. Actual or expected changes in AVR Operating status shall be reported in

Real-Time in accordance with OP-12 and M/LCC 8, unless the
requirement for such Real-Time reporting of AVR operating status is
automatically waived during the periods of time when Real-Time
conditions occur that are as described by the Lead MP on the Form NX12D pertaining to when the Lead MP routinely expects that its Generator
will not operate with the AVR in service and controlling voltage (such as
during start-up or shutdown). When such conditions occur that match the
conditions described on Form NX-12D, this serves as advance standing
notification and Real-Time reporting is not required.

**I. Governor Control**

Where not already required to do so pursuant to the Interconnection
Agreement, each Lead MP shall provide, maintain and operate a
“functioning governor” on each Generator with a capability of ten (10) MW
or greater. The conditions of interconnection applicability noted in II.H.1
for AVRs shall also be applied to governor control.

New generators subject to the ISO’s Interconnection Procedures shall
follow the governor control requirements of OP 14. New generators
interconnecting through a state interconnection process shall follow the
governor control requirements of the interconnecting utility. Existing
generators (ranging from active commercial generators to generators that
have begun the system interconnection study (study scoping has started)
prior to the effective date of Revision 34 of this procedure interconnected
at voltages below 69 kV which have governor control requirements due to
OP-14 shall retain the need for AVR control, unless the interconnecting
utility exempts the generator from the governor control obligation and such
generator shall meet the voltage requirements documented in its
interconnection study.

1. For the purposes of this OP, a “functioning governor” includes hardware or

software that provides autonomous frequency-responsive power control.
This requirement applies to all conventional Generators and nonconventional power sources including but not limited to: defined
Generator Assets, aggregated Generator Assets, wind turbine Generator
Assets, all elements of a photovoltaic Generator Asset, etc. The
equipment providing “governor functionality” shall be set such that:

a. It has a speed droop based on nameplate capability or the value

determined in Section II.A.2 of this OP set with a maximum of five
percent (5%);

b. It has a frequency response deadband of no greater than 59.964
60.036 Hz; and

c. The real power response is not inhibited by effects of outer loop

controls (such as operator setpoint controls and load control but
excluding AGC) that would override the governor response (including


-----

blocked or nonfunctioning governors or modes of operating that limit
Frequency Response[9]). Meeting this requirement results in providing
primary frequency response.

2. Upon ISO request, the Lead MP shall verify that actual governor operation

in response to load control and/or active power/frequency control
approximates the specified droop. Verification shall be in the form of Plant
Information (PI) data indicating MW response to frequency events during
a fifteen (15) minute interval (MW and Hz timestamp data five (5) minutes
prior and ten (10) minutes post an identified frequency event).

3. The DE, acting on behalf of the Lead MP, shall inform ISO of actual or

expected changes in governor operating status per Master/Local Control
Center Procedure No. 10 - Generator Governor Control and Operation
(M/LCC 10). Each Lead MP is responsible for periodic testing and
maintenance of the Generator governor.

4. Except as otherwise provided in the Interconnection Agreement, ISO shall

consider a well-documented and technically valid request to be exempt
from the requirements of this Section II.I. All requests shall be submitted
through “Ask ISO” and shall include “Governor Exemption Request” with
the Asset name and ID number in the issue summary. Any such request
shall be reviewed by ISO technical staff for acceptability. Any Generator
whose exemption is accepted shall be listed on a governor exemption list
in M/LCC 10 Attachment A - Generators Exempted from Governor
Requirements. A Generator listed in M/LCC 10 Attachment A either does
**not have a governor or does not operate its governor in conformance with**
the requirements in this OP. For all such Generators, ISO has reviewed
the impact of this status and has determined that this status is acceptable
from a reliability perspective. If evaluation is needed ISO will undertake
evaluation under ISO Tariff Section I.3.9. All governor exemption
requests shall be reported to the Reliability Committee. If accepted by
ISO, the Generator Asset and unit, if applicable, will be listed in M/LCC 10
Attachment A. The exemption process shall only consider a full
exemption from all governor requirements.

Addition to the exemption list does not preclude reevaluation required
with changes processed through the Large Generator Interconnection
Procedure (LGIP) / Small Generator Interconnection Procedure (SGIP)
Schedules 22 and 23, respectively. These exemption criteria do not
relieve that resource from adhering to any other ISO New England
Operating Documents or program requirements.

**J. Interconnection**

1. A Generator seeking to connect its facilities to transmission facilities shall

have a valid Interconnection Agreement(s) in place with the Transmission
Owners(s) with which the Generator is seeking to interconnect, or whose
facilities are impacted. The terms and conditions of said Interconnection

9 Frequency Response is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards


-----

Agreement(s) shall be negotiated between the entities that are parties to
the Interconnection Agreement(s) and may or may not contain additional
and/or more stringent requirements than those prescribed by ISO.

**K. System Protection**

1. At a minimum, each Lead MP shall install and maintain protection systems

in accordance with the NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory # 4

    - Bulk Power System Protection Criteria (NPCC Directory #4) on each unit
that is large enough to affect the systems of others. Each Lead MP shall
maintain and upgrade the protection system such that it continues to meet
the reliability criteria of NPCC.

2. Relay maintenance and testing that would in any way degrade the level of

system protection or system reliability provided by the unit shall not occur
while the unit is on-line. All requests for such maintenance shall adhere to
the requirements of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Maintenance Outage Scheduling (OP-3), and local
scheduling procedures at the lower voltage levels.

3. NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC-01 identifies thresholds for

setting underfrequency trip protection for generators. The Lead MP for a
Generator shall verify that its Generator meets the appropriate figure in
PRC-006-NPCC-01 for underfrequency tripping unless it has arranged
compensatory load shedding with a Distribution Provider or Transmission
Owner in the same underfrequency island and in accordance with the
standard.[10]

**L. Power System Stabilizers**

1. Where power system stabilizer (PSS) equipment is installed on a

Generator for the purpose of maintaining system stability, the Lead MP
shall maintain the PSS equipment in good operating condition, and
promptly report to ISO any problems interfering with PSS proper
operation. The Lead MP shall operate the PSS out-of-service unless
directed otherwise per the unit’s System Impact Study (SIS) or as directed
by other studies as may be performed by ISO. A listing of Generators
required to have a PSS in-service can be found in M/LCC 8, Attachment B

    - Generators Requiring PSS Devices In/Out of Service. Each Lead MP
shall promptly report to ISO or the appropriate dispatch center, if and
when the PSS is intended to be either placed into or removed from service
prior to taking such action unless warranted by emergency plant
conditions.

10 Requirement R 13 of PRC-006-NPCC-01 provides that “[e]ach Generator Owner shall set each
generator underfrequency trip relay, if so equipped, below the appropriate generator underfrequency trip
protection settings threshold curve in Figure 1, except as otherwise exempted in Requirements R16 and
R19.” (Emphasis added). In a September 22, 2015 presentation, NPCC provided a compliance
clarification under which setting underfrequency trip relays “on or below the curve” is acceptable to show
compliance with Requirement R 13 of PRC-006-NPCC-01

Regulation Market offer process. However, each ATRR shall meet other
eligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO Tariff and ISO Manuals to offer
into the New England Markets.

**A. ATRR Defined**

1. Each ATRR shall be defined consistently for all ISO applications. That is,

it shall be defined in the same manner for the purposes of Regulation
offers, dispatch and settlement. Each ATRR shall communicate with ISO
through its approved DE. Registration of an ATRR will be subject to the
provisions of ISO Tariff Section I.3.9, to the extent that the operation of the
proposed ATRR may have a significant effect on the stability, reliability or
operating characteristics of the New England RCA/BAA. A defined ATRR
that is not part of a CSF shall only be dispatched via electronic dispatch
for Regulation service.

2. The Lead MP right to aggregate sub-resources to define an ATRR for

offer, dispatch and settlement shall be governed by the following rules:

a. An ATRR associated with a CSF cannot be composed of an

aggregation of sub-resources.

b. Individual sub-resources shall be less than one (1) MW of Regulation

Capacity. If greater than or equal to one (1) MW of Regulation
Capacity, it shall register as a separate ATRR.

c. ISO shall determine if sub-resources may be combined and defined as

one ATRR.

d. ISO shall consider if such a combination of sub-resources interferes

with effective control and/or system reliability.

3. To define an ATRR, the Lead MP shall submit any technical data with

respect to an ATRR and any sub-resources when ISO determines it is
necessary for ISO to carry out its responsibility of reliable and efficient
operation of the BES. The Lead MP shall submit the technical data for
each sub-resource irrespective of it being a single unit or an aggregation.
The Lead MP shall submit and maintain all requested data of the ATRR.
A defined ATRR shall have an approved DE, provide all required data and
have all required communications equipment in place and tested in
accordance with ISO procedures prior to being available for dispatch. The
Lead MP shall identify the DE. The Lead MP shall communicate to ISO
through the identified DE. The data may include, but not be limited to, the
following, as necessary:

the ability, through the installation and maintenance of adequate
hardware and software and communications infrastructure within the
Continental United States, to provide for the electronic transmission of
data relative to the dispatch to carry out the Real-Time dispatch
processes from ISO issuance of Dispatch Instructions to the actual
increase or decrease in injection or consumption of ATRR(s). The
hardware and software and communications infrastructure may be
located outside the Continental United States if agreed to on a caseby-case basis by ISO. An ATRR is considered to have EDC when it is
capable of receiving, responding to, and changing output in response
to electronic Dispatch Instructions issued to the ISO CFE-connected
RTU of its DE.

5. To define a new ATRR, a minimum of one hundred and twenty (120)

calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required.

To change data for an existing ATRR definition:,

  - A minimum of seven (7) calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is

required. The advance notice period commences upon ISO receipt of
the criteria detailed in Section III.A.3 of this OP.

  - Dispatch methodology may be changed to be effective at the start of

every calendar quarter. Requests to change the dispatch method of
an ATRR shall be received no later than thirty (30) Business Days
before the requested effective date of the change. There are three (3)
dispatch methodology selections
```
   o Continuous - energy neutral

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes criteria, operating practices, and responsibilities
to maintain desired/reliable voltage and reactive conditions on the power system. It
includes general actions to control voltage/reactive conditions when deviations from normal
conditions occur, or are needed, to minimize adverse effects during abnormal conditions.

Specific criteria and actions are contained in detailed voltage/reactive documents issued as
part of the ISO New England (ISO) Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs). Temporary
transmission operating guides (TGs) may contain additional criteria and actions required to
correct abnormal voltage/reactive conditions. Permanent TOGs and TGs are published in
the Operations Documents Management System (ODMS); all are classified under
Attachment D - ISO New England Information Policy to the ISO New England Inc.
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, as Confidential and Critical Energy
Infrastructure Information (CEII) documents and are not publically available.


-----

**II.** **CRITERIA**

**A. Voltage Schedules and Limits for Transmission Equipment and Generators**

Voltage schedules and limits for transmission equipment and NERC registered and/or
transmission connected (69 kV or higher) Generators that can control transmission
voltage are specified by ISO in Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules (OP-12B) of
this OP. The majority of the information in OP-12B is sourced from the NX database.

As described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical
Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands
and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), Generators are required to
submit Form NX-12D. As described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 –
Transmission System Data (OP-16), Transmission Owners (TOs) are required to submit
Form NX-9 for transmission equipment. Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources
are also required to submit Form NX-12D.

OP-12B includes schedules and device information for:
```
        o Transmission-connected Generators, which includes but is not limited to:

```
            - Multi-machine Synchronous Generator Plants

             - Solar Photovoltaic Generation Plants

            - Wind Turbine Generation Plants

             - Fuel Cell Plants
```
        o Transmission-connected Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources,

```
which includes but is not limited to:

           - Transmission Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs)

            - Transmission Static VAR Compensators

           - Synchronous Condensers

For the above devices, OP-12B reports voltage schedules and device
parameters as approved in Form NX-12D. Reactive capabilities shall
represent test data. If test data is not available, theoretical values may be
used.

OP-12B also includes information for:

      - Autotransformers with Load Tap Changers (LTCs) – OP-12B reports voltage

schedules and device parameters as approved in Form NX-9B.

      - Transmission Capacitors – OP-12B reports device parameters as approved in

Form NX-9D.

      - Transmission Reactors – OP-12B reports device parameters as approved in Form

NX-9D and Form NX-9G.


-----

OP-12B classifies the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources
based on voltage control:

  - Part of the Form NX-12D describes the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic

Reactive Resources capability to control voltage. A Generator or Non-Generator
Dynamic Reactive Resources voltage control capability is described by one of
these three categories:

  - Option A – These Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources

directly regulate transmission system voltage (69kV and above) to a schedule.
These Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources are listed
in OP-12B

`o` Newly-interconnecting transmission-connected Generators (and Gen

installed reactive devices) and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive
Resources must have a voltage control system that directly regulates a
transmission bus to a voltage schedule. Transmission voltage schedules
will be provided in OP-12B and are adjustable in real-time by the LCC /
ISO. Plant terminal voltage(s) and/or reactive power output(s) must adjust
automatically, without a human in the loop, to adhere to the plants
transmission voltage schedule.

Transmission-connected Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic
Reactive Resources are those whose Point Of Interconnection (POI)
is 69 kV and above, as described in their S/LGIA.

By exception, if a documented technical rationale demonstrates that
an alternate voltage control strategy not involving direct regulation of
a transmission bus is warranted on an engineering basis (for
example, as an outcome of the System Impact Study), such a
transmission-connected Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic
Reactive Resource would not be considered Option A.

`o` Existing Option A Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive

Resources may utilize human operator intervention to regulate a
transmission bus to a voltage schedule. For example, an existing unit
(without an automatic outer loop control system) where the plant operator
provides the outer loop control function by manually adjusting a terminal
voltage control set point to achieve transmission system voltage
regulation to its OP-12B schedule will remain an Option A unit.

If such an existing Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive
Resource undergoes a reactive power control system replacement
(e.g. excitation system upgrade), the Generator or Non-Generator
Dynamic Reactive Resource shall meet the requirement described in
i. for automatic outer loop direct transmission bus voltage regulation.

`o` Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources are

considered to be interconnecting at transmission voltage levels if they are
directly stepping up (or down), via transformation, from their local voltage
into a transmission station.


-----

Transmission voltage schedules are not specified for Generator and NonGenerator Dynamic Reactive devices not modeled in the ISO Energy
Management System (EMS) Network Database.

  -  Option B – These Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources

regulate voltage at a bus below that of a transmission voltage level (less than 69
kV). They may follow local voltage schedules specified by the low voltage facility
owner in accordance with LCC requirements or as required in their
Interconnection Agreements.

`o` At the discretion of ISO in coordination with the LCC, a transmission
connected Option B unit may warrant inclusion in OP-12B, listing the nontransmission voltage schedule.

  -  Option C – These Generators are exempt from the requirement to have an

automatic voltage regulator (AVR). These Generators are listed in M/LCC 8A.
As noted in M/LCC 8A, these Generators commonly follow a reactive power
schedule by operating with a constant power factor as specified in their
Interconnection Agreements.

OP-12B contains voltage schedules for all Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic
Reactive Resources that are Option A, which are Generators and Non-Generator
Dynamic Reactive Resources that regulate transmission voltage. OP-12B also may
include certain transmission-connected Option B Generators and Non-Generator
Dynamic Reactive Resources at the discretion of ISO in coordination with the LCC.

The voltage schedule specified for a Generator in OP-12B is the prescribed normal
voltage that a Generator shall maintain. This normal voltage schedule is represented by
a kV schedule value with accompanying operational kV high and kV low values that
establish the “voltage schedule tolerance band.”

Currently, the normal voltage schedule is indicated in the “On Peak Period” fields, and if
applicable, an alternate schedule is indicated in the “Off Peak Period” fields. A
Generator shall maintain voltage output within its normal voltage schedule tolerance
band values in system operations at all times while one or more units at the generating
station are online, unless otherwise directed by ISO or the LCC. These voltage
schedules shall also be used by operators and planners in off-line studies of the power
system.

During certain infrequent, atypical conditions at a generating station or on the power
system, ISO or an LCC may issue an Operating Instruction to a Generator or NonGenerator Reactive Resource to deviate from its normal voltage schedule and to
temporarily operate at a voltage output level outside of the normal voltage schedule
tolerance band, but within the wider minimum and maximum “acceptable” voltage
schedule range, which is also listed in OP-12B. Note this operation may need to be
examined by engineering to determine if operation at this temporary voltage schedule
impacts stability limits for the unit or system.

During these conditions, if ISO or the LCC issue an Operating Instruction to a
generating station to operate to a temporary voltage schedule, ISO or the LCC shall
provide each applicable generating station operator with the following:


-----

   - The temporary voltage schedule to be maintained with the AVR in-service and

controlling to a voltage setpoint

   - The temporary voltage schedule tolerance band to be maintained

    - The expected duration of this temporary voltage schedule change (if known, or

“until further notice”)

During normal operations on the power system, the ISO or an LCC may issue an
Operating Instruction to a Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource to
adjust their voltage setpoint while remaining within the normal voltage schedule
tolerance band. Adjustments such as these are not considered a change to the OP-12B
listed voltage schedule provided the setpoint remains within the original tolerance band.

If the generating station operator has been directed to deviate from the normal voltage
schedule and tolerance band, the LCC shall contact the generating station operator at
least once per shift to confirm the temporary voltage schedule and tolerance band.
Once the temporary voltage schedule is no longer applicable, the ISO or LCC shall
issue an Operating Instruction to the generating station operator to return to the normal
voltage schedule and tolerance band.

**B. Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources Reactive Capabilities,**

**Commitments and Required Reactive Reserves**

Generators’ and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ reactive capabilities
entered in the NX-12D Forms shall be used in system operations and analyses. Each
Generator’s and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ reactive capability shall
be fully available when the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource
is on-line and any change to the Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive
Resource reactive capability shall be reported to the ISO and LCC in Real-Time in
accordance with Appendix B to OP-14 (OP-14B).

To reflect Generators’ and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ updated
reactive capabilities, and to capture any voltage schedule or equipment parameter
changes, OP-12B will be updated as needed, using the NX database as its source.

To promote security of the transmission system during adverse voltage/reactive
conditions, required Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource
commitments and levels of required reactive reserve from Generators and NonGenerator Dynamic Reactive Resources within certain areas of the New England
Reliability Coordinator Area (RCA) have been established. System conditions that
warrant the prescribed Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource
commitments or reactive reserves have also been identified. As applicable, details are
contained in the TOGs and TGs.


-----

**III.** **VOLTAGE/REACTIVE OPERATING PRACTICES**

**A. Traditional Voltage/Reactive Control**

Dispatch of shunt capacitors/reactors combined with effective transformer voltage
schedules or fixed tap settings are the most traditional means of achieving desired
voltages and reactive conditions while maintaining dynamic reactive reserve on
Generators. Switchable shunt devices installed to support the New England
Transmission System (115 kV and above) and guides for switching them can be found
in OP-12B and in the TOGs.

**B. Transmission Interface Transfer Limits to Avoid Low Voltage**

In some cases, custom software tools have been developed to calculate voltage-based
transfer limits for transmission interfaces. These limits provide acceptable voltage
response to contingencies. As applicable, details are contained in the TOGs and TGs.

**C. Circuit Switching to Control High Voltage**

In some areas, transmission circuit switching is a viable option for controlling high
voltage/excessive charging conditions. As applicable, details are contained in the TOGs
and TGs

**D. Load Management for Voltage/Reactive Reliability**

In severe cases of low voltage and/or inadequate reactive reserves, load management
actions may be taken. Details on conditions when these actions may/shall be used and
how they shall be implemented are described in the TOGs and ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4) and ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7).


-----

**IV. RESPONSIBILITIES**

This OP is based on the principle that voltage control is best achieved when action is taken
as close as possible to the affected area. Voltage schedules and other reactive conditions
shall be supervised by the generating station operators, transmission station operators,
LCC System Operators and ISO System Operators, each having a specific area of
responsibility. Regardless of who issues an Operating Instruction for a corrective measure
(ISO or LCC, respectively), action shall ultimately be taken by a generating/transmission
station operator or LCC System Operator depending on who has ""hands on"" control of the
reactive resource.

**A. Generating and Transmission Stations**

**1. Generating Station and Transmission Station Operation to Maintain Voltage**

**Schedule**

Generating station operators and transmission station operators are responsible for
maintaining station service and other local voltage requirements and scheduled
voltages at levels designated by ISO in OP-12B, or as otherwise specified through an
Operating Instruction issued by ISO or an LCC.

Transmission station operators with control over dynamic reactive resources
maintaining a voltage schedule within a voltage schedule tolerance band outlined in
OP-12B shall comply with the requirements for generating station operators
outlined in this Section IV.A.1.

Automatic voltage regulation normally works off the low-side of the step-up
transformer (generator terminals). In order to maintain a high-side voltage schedule,
manual intervention may be required to offset varying power flows through and
voltage drops across the step-up transformer.

The generating station operator shall maintain the high-side bus voltage within the
normal voltage schedule tolerance band, as specified in the “kV High” and “kV Low”
levels for the appropriate load period and indicated in the “Operational Voltage
Schedules” columns of OP-12B. If a Generator does not have high-side bus voltage
visibility (visibility of the bus voltage that is of the same voltage class as its schedule),
a description of the method used to derive its GSU low-side schedule to achieve the
assigned voltage schedule shall be included in the unit’s NX-12D Form in accordance
with OP-14B.

Operation outside of the prescribed normal voltage schedule tolerance band shall
be kept to a minimum. The generating station operator shall regularly check
Generator high-side bus voltage against scheduled voltage and if the high-side
voltage is outside the voltage schedule tolerance band, act to reestablish voltage
within the tolerance band within 15 minutes. When a generating station operator or
transmission station operator is unable to maintain the scheduled voltage within the
voltage schedule tolerance band and local voltages with the means under its
control, the generating station operator or transmission station operator shall notify
its respective LCC System Operator (and local dispatch authority if appropriate). If a
Generator’s high-side bus voltage drifts outside of its normal voltage schedule
tolerance band, the generating station operator shall immediately notify the LCC


-----

when one of the following conditions is met:

(1) The Generator has been operating outside of its prescribed voltage

schedule tolerance band for a continuous period of 15 minutes; or

(2) The generating station operator determines that the Generator will be

unable to return to operating within its prescribed voltage schedule
tolerance band within 15 minutes

A unit is not allowed to operate outside its normal voltage schedule tolerance band
unless ISO or the LCC issues an Operating Instruction to do so. If a unit is not
maintaining its voltage within the prescribed normal voltage schedule tolerance band
for a period exceeding 15 minutes and has not notified the LCC (as described
above), or is not closely following an alternative voltage schedule issued by ISO or
the LCC, then the unit shall be considered to be in violation of this OP.

When a Generator is issued an Operating Instruction to deviate from its normal
voltage schedule and tolerance band, the Generator shall operate within this
temporary voltage schedule tolerance band until further notice.

**2. Generator Operation in Automatic Voltage Control Mode**

NERC Reliability Standard VAR-002 - Generator Operation for Maintaining Network
Voltage Schedules requires each Generator equipped with an AVR to operate in
the automatic voltage control mode. Whenever the AVR operation is available, the
Generator AVR shall:

    - Be in-service and controlling voltage, and

   - Remain in this configuration unless otherwise directed by the ISO or LCC

System Operator.

In ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 – Metering and Telemetering
Criteria (OP-18), ISO-NE requires each Generator modeled in the ISO EMS
Network Database to provide telemetry indicating its AVR’s status. Generators
exempted from operating with their AVR in the voltage control mode will be
documented in M/LCC 8A and will not be required to provide AVR status telemetry.
The ISO may require AVR status for a Generator that has an operational impact but
is not modeled in the ISO EMS Network Database.

When a Generator AVR is out-of-service, the generating station operator shall use
an alternative method to control the Generator reactive output to meet the voltage
or Reactive Power schedule. Actual or expected changes in AVR operating status
shall be reported in accordance with this OP and with M/LCC 8 as follows:

   - The generating station operator shall report changes to AVR status in Real
Time except for conditions that the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) has
reported in advance on Form NX-12D, as described in the following
paragraph. The Generator shall make those reports whenever the AVR is
removed from or placed in-service unless taking those actions is warranted by
emergency plant conditions. The generating station operator shall also report
any problems that could interfere with proper operation of an AVR. These
reports shall be made to the following entities as soon as the AVR status


-----

change condition arises, as follows:
```
       o The generating station operator shall report to the applicable LCC; and
       o The Lead MP shall report to ISO through its assigned Designated Entity

```
(DE)

     - When the Lead MP describes expected changes to AVR status that occur

during Real-Time conditions on Form NX-12D for the Generator in
accordance with ISO OP-14 (i.e. periods of time when the Lead MP routinely
expects that its Generator will not operate with the AVR in-service and
controlling voltage, such as during start-up or shut-down) these changes shall
**not to be reported in Real-Time. When conditions that match the conditions**
described on Form NX-12D occur, the information on Form NX-12D shall
serve as advance standing notification and Real-Time reporting shall not be
required.

**3. Generator Verification of Reactive Capability**

Each generating station operator is responsible to comply with the reactive capability
verification process detailed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No.23 Resource Auditing (OP-23).

**B. LCCs**

Each LCC is responsible for monitoring the following:

(1) Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and static VAR compensator

voltage schedules, limits and AVR status.

(2) Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and static VAR compensator

MVAr loadings, capabilities and reserves.

(3) Transformer voltage schedules.

(4) MVAr flows between the AC system and HVDC facilities.

(5) Other predefined indicators of voltage/reactive security (e.g., a particular circuit

flow, the status of specific Generators, area load level, etc.).

The LCCs are responsible for:

(1) Dispatching shunt capacitors and reactors.

(2) Implementing transformer fixed and seasonal tap settings.

(3) Line switching for voltage/reactive control (which shall be coordinated with ISO

and, if warranted, with other LCCs).

(4) Detecting and correcting deviations from the voltage schedule tolerance band

on a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and/or static VAR
compensator.

Providing Real-time voltage setpoint changes to the operator of a Generator,
STATCOM, synchronous condenser or static VAR compensator to include the


-----

temporary voltage setpoint to maintain, with AVR in-service and controlling
voltage.

(5) Providing Real-Time voltage schedule changes to the operator of a Generator,

STATCOM, synchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator, including the
following information:
```
    o The temporary voltage schedule to maintain with AVR in-service and

```
controlling voltage.
```
    o The temporary voltage schedule tolerance band to maintain.
    o The expected duration of this temporary voltage schedule change.

```
(6) Contacting the operator of a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser,

or static VAR compensator that has been directed to deviate from the normal
voltage schedule and tolerance band at least once per shift, to confirm the
temporary voltage schedule and tolerance band.

(7) Directing the operator of a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, or

static VAR compensator to return to the normal voltage schedule and
tolerance band once the temporary voltage schedule is no longer applicable.

(8) Responding to notifications from the operator of a Generator, STATCOM,

synchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator of their difficulty in
maintaining station or other local voltage or reactive schedules.

(9) Responding to ISO requests to assist with inter-LCC or inter-area problems.

(10) Notifying/coordinating with ISO when there is a need to adjust the real power

(MW) output of a Generator in order to adjust its MVAr output. ISO shall
provide the direction to the DE to adjust its Generator real power (MW) output.
Unless an emergency condition warrants such action, the LCCs shall not
directly issue an Operating Instruction to the generating station operator to
adjust the real power output (MW) of its Generator in order to adjust its MVAr
output.

(11) Notifying/coordinating with ISO, any of the following voltage/reactive control

actions prior to implementation:
```
    o Line switching.
    o Load management in response to voltage SOL exceedance/violation.
    o Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator

```
voltage schedule tolerance band (kV high and/or kV low) changes.

If ISO and an LCC differ on what the voltage schedule should be for a given unit, then
ISO and that LCC shall discuss and agree upon the appropriate voltage schedule to be
communicated to the unit.

When an LCC is unable to correct a voltage/reactive problem using all available
actions or the LCC believes that the problem should be handled on a multi-LCC or
inter-RCA basis, the LCC shall notify ISO and request assistance.


-----

To verify a Generator’s voltage control capability, each LCC shall use the template
provided in OP-12, Appendix D - Voltage Schedule Annual Transmittal Form (OP-12D).
During the first quarter of each year, each LCC shall email the OP-12D transmittal form
to each Option A or Option B Generator within its operational footprint that is
represented in the ISO EMS. The OP-12D transmittal form shall be sent to the Lead
MP for that Generator.

As the source of email addresses for the Lead MPs, each LCC shall use the DE
Contact Information posted on the confidential satellite information website at:

[https://smd.iso-ne.com/satellite/nx12_initialdisplay/](https://smd.iso-ne.com/satellite/nx12_initialdisplay/)

On each such transmittal, the LCC shall copy the Chair of the Voltage Task Force at
email address:

[vtfcontact@iso-ne.com](mailto:vtfcontact@iso-ne.com)

**C. ISO**

ISO is responsible for;

(1) General monitoring and supervision of voltage/reactive conditions in the New
England RCA (115 kV and above). When system monitoring detects a problem
within an LCC, ISO shall contact the LCC and request action.

(2) Notifying the applicable LCC as soon as it becomes aware of an emergency or
forced outage of a Generator AVR.

      - When an LCC reports to ISO that it is not possible to correct an abnormal

voltage/reactive-related operating condition at a station or an LCC level,
ISO shall assume direct responsibility for alleviating the problem. ISO shall
direct, through the appropriate LCC(s), all actions listed in the above LCC
Section IV. B of this OP as well as any MW re-dispatching.

      - If ISO and an LCC differ on what the voltage schedule should be for a

given unit, then ISO and that LCC shall discuss and agree upon the
appropriate voltage schedule to be communicated to the unit.

(3) Monitoring and supervising voltage/reactive operations of inter-RCA ties.
Abnormal voltage/reactive-related operating conditions may be noticed by ISO
or appear in the form of requests from a neighboring Reliability Coordinator or
entities for assistance. ISO shall inform the appropriate LCC(s) of the nature of
the problem specifying; the pool or entity involved, the location of the
undesirable voltage/reactive condition and general conditions aggravating the
difficulty. ISO may work with/through the LCCs and use all actions under
Section IV. B of this OP as well as MW re-dispatching to eliminate the
problem.

      - When abnormal voltage/reactive operating conditions materialize, ISO may

initiate a survey of key system parameters to better assess the nature and
expanse of the conditions. Online tools are used to conduct the surveys.

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

## 1. Introduction

This Appendix F describes Wind Plant operating requirements and the data reporting
requirements that Wind Plant Operators shall submit to ISO New England (ISO).
The submittal of such data supports the operation of a centralized regional wind
power forecasting system and therefore, the reliable and efficient integration of wind
power into the ISO New England Balancing Authority Area (ISO-NE BAA). The
requirements stated in this Appendix F apply to all Wind Plants that will be or are
dispatched by ISO and represented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS).
Included also are requirements for data that will be integrated into the ISO EMS in
order to facilitate operator system awareness and allow for the utilization of
automated dispatch for wind Generator Assets[1].

## 2. Definitions

Below are definitions of relevant terms in this Appendix F:

**_Curtailment or Curtailed – Wind Plant Operator action (whether manual,_**
scheduled, or automatic), resulting from an ISO Dispatch Instruction, that limits the
amount of power produced by wind turbine(s) within a Wind Plant to below the
maximum amount of power that could be produced by the normally operating
available equipment given the current weather conditions at the wind turbine and/or
Wind Plant.

**_Met Gathering Station – a permanent purpose-built and/or sited station dedicated to_**
the collection of Meteorological Data.

**_Meteorological Data– The real-time data (e.g., wind speeds and directions)_**
collected at a specific Wind Plant’s location.

**_Plant Wind Directions (nacelle-level) – The instantaneous wind direction and_**
calibrated for True North equal to 0 degrees.

**_Plant Wind Speeds (nacelle-level) – The instantaneous wind speeds measured by_**
wind measuring equipment (e.g. anemometry).

**_Real Time High Operating Limit – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE_**
Transmission Markets and Services Tariff (“Tariff”)[2].

**_Wind High Limit – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets, and_**
Services Tariff (“Tariff”).

**_Wind Plant – For the purpose of this Appendix F, a Wind Plant is a collection of one_**
or more wind turbine generators and the additional equipment required to
interconnect these wind turbines into the electrical power system, consistent with the

1 Note that this Appendix F discusses Wind Plant data reporting and operating requirements. To the extent that

there are other operating, transmission service and market requirements applicable to Wind Plants, the Wind Plant
Operator must refer to and comply with the applicable ISO New England Operating Documents.

definition of a Generator Asset stated in Section I of the Tariff. A Wind Plant shall be
comprised of one or more Wind Turbine Groups.

**_Wind Plant Future Availability (WPFA) – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE_**
Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (“Tariff”).

**_Wind Plant Operator – for the purposes of this Appendix F, is the Lead Market_**
Participant (Lead MP), or its designee, who operates a Wind Plant and/or reports the
data to ISO as required in this Appendix F, as applicable.

**_Wind Turbine Counts: - shall include the following 4 (four) values (see Figure 1_**
below for a visual representation of the definitions):

**_Wind Turbines Curtailed – is the total number of wind turbines in the Wind Plant_**
that are Curtailed.

**_Wind Turbines Out-of-Service – is the total number of wind turbines at a Wind_**
Plant that are out-of-service for any reason.

**_Wind Turbines Operating Normally – is the total number of wind turbines at a_**
Wind Plant that are operating normally (i.e., not out-of-service and not Curtailed)
regardless of whether or not those wind turbines are generating real power (MW).

**_Wind Turbines Generating Power – is the total number of wind turbines at a_**
Wind Plant that are generating real power (MW) at any level regardless of
whether or not those wind turbines are limited due to Curtailments.

**Figure 1 - Wind Turbine Counts**

**_Wind Turbine Group – is a group of wind turbine generators within the Wind Plant_**
where all wind turbines generators are within a 10 (plant wide average) rotor
diameter radius from the nearest neighboring wind turbine generator. One or more
Wind Turbine Groups shall comprise a Wind Plant. See Attachment A - Wind
Turbine Groups of this Appendix F for examples of Wind Turbine Group
configurations.

## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements

**3.1 Wind Plant Data**

Unless other modeling and data arrangements are agreed upon by ISO, Wind Plant
data (whether static or telemetered) that is submitted by a Wind Plant Operator in
accordance with this Appendix F shall be consistent with the definition of Wind
Plant.

**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**

A Wind Plant shall be designed and operated (including the performance of
reclosings and restarts) by the Wind Plant Operator in accordance with ISO New
England Operating Documents, which apply to all generating unit Resources
within the ISO-NE BAA.

If the Wind Plant main breaker is opened (i.e., the plant is manually or
automatically disconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission
System) the Wind Plant Operator must receive permission from ISO and the LCC
prior to reclosing (i.e., reconnect to the New England Transmission System). In
other words, an automatic restart of the Wind Plant is not permitted following a
fault to the Distribution System or Transmission System that is severe enough to
disconnect the Wind Plant [e.g., an Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) event that
is not “ridden through”] or following any Wind Plant-wide out-of-service event.

The automatic restart of a Wind Plant following high wind speed cut-out events is
allowed.

**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**

Due to the very fast ramping capabilities of Wind Plants, there is potential for the
transmission equipment with which they are interconnected to become
significantly loaded or unloaded, which may lead to operational and reliability
concerns, therefore ramp rate limitations have been established as described
below. As operational experience is gained, ISO shall reevaluate this limit on a
Wind Plant-by-Wind Plant basis, or as it applies to all Wind Plants in New
England, as warranted. Where alternative ramp rates are determined to be
acceptable on a Wind Plant-specific basis, those plant-specific limits shall be
provided to the Lead MP by ISO.

For Wind Plants totaling 200 MW or less in nameplate, under all conditions except
for emergencies and decreasing wind conditions, a default maximum ramp rate of
20 MW/min averaged over five minutes is not to be exceeded unless otherwise
requested by ISO.

For Wind Plants of greater than 200 MW in nameplate, under all conditions except
for emergencies and decreasing wind conditions, a default maximum ramp rate of
10% of nameplate per minute (in MW/min) averaged over 5 (five) minutes is not
to be exceeded unless otherwise requested by ISO; see example below.

**3.4 Outage Coordination**

ISO New England Operating Procedure No.5 - Resource Maintenance and
Outage Scheduling (OP-5) requires a generating unit Resource to submit an
outage request via ISO Outage Application software whenever a Resource is “out
of service”, meaning that the Resource is not able to provide real power MW onto
the electrical grid. Outage requests can be for planned or unplanned outages. In
the case of Wind Plants, OP-5 requirements that the Wind Plant Operator submits
advance daily outage requests in order to perform routine maintenance work on a
Wind Plant component [i.e., individual wind turbine(s)] which may have no effect
on their overall MW capability of the Wind Plant.

Therefore:

1. Each Wind Plant Operator shall submit Wind Plant Future Availability to

ISO for each Wind Plant. The Wind Plant Future Availability shall serve
as the Wind Plant Operator “notification” of an outage for OP-5 purposes.

2. If a Wind Plant does not have a CSO and is not a Qualified Generator

Reactive Resource as stated above, a Wind Plant Operator must submit
to ISO the Wind Plant Future Availability for the Wind Plant; but a Wind
Plant Operator is not required to submit outage requests for the Wind
Plant to ISO.

3. For each Wind Plant with a CSO or that is a Qualified Generator Reactive

Resource, the Wind Plant Operator must submit:

A. Wind Plant Future Availability to ISO for the Wind Plant; and,

B. When the outage will de-rate the Wind Plant to the point that the total

available nameplate is less than its CSO or when the outage will
reduce the available VArs to less than the Qualified VArs, submit an

## 4. Static Plant Data Requirements

Below are the static plant data requirements that describe the physical layout of the
Wind Plant and any associated meteorological equipment as well as data relevant to
the design and operation of the Wind Plant. This data must be maintained and
submitted by the Wind Plant Operator to ISO on Attachment C, Wind Plant Static
Data Information Form to this Appendix F. The Wind Plant Static Data Information
Form is an editable Excel workbook file and must be requested from, completed, and
returned as an Excel workbook file to the ISO at RenewableResourceInt@isone.com. A sample Attachment C is included in this Appendix F. Instructions are
included on the form on how to request, complete, and submit the required
information. Consistent with Schedules 22 and 23 of Section II of the Tariff and OP14, the Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the static plant data for each Wind Plant
is kept current and changes are communicated to ISO via an Attachment C submittal
if any data point changes in a material fashion. For example:

     -  if a wind turbine in the Wind Plant is replaced with a different make or model

type, information for the new wind turbine must be supplied;

     -  if the permitting requirements change, the new requirements must be

specified;

     -  if wind measuring equipment is replaced with non-identical measuring

equipment, the make and model information for the new equipment must be
supplied.

long-term average density expected for the plant and one power curve
each for normal operation at approximately 85% (+/- 10%) and
approximately 115% (+/-10%), respectively of the expected long-term
average Wind Plant air density

## 5. Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer

This section presents the real-time operational and meteorological data requirements
for Wind Plant Operators. In accordance with Table 6.1 to this Appendix F, data
required under this Section must be electronically and automatically transmitted by
the Wind Plant Operator to ISO over a secure network using the protocol approved
by ISO. In addition, if any recommended (i.e. not required) data is provided by the
Wind Plant Operator, it must also be electronically and automatically transmitted over
a secure network using the protocol approved by ISO. Wind power forecasting
accuracy is highly dependent on the availability of the real-time meteorological,
power production, and status data for tuning the forecaster models. As such, this
information is required with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.

**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**

_5.1.1 Meteorological Data_

The following Wind Plant data shall be provided by the Wind Plant Operator to ISO.

At a minimum:

1. Nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements must be provided

from the highest wind turbine (i.e., wind turbine hub elevation in terms of
elevation above mean sea level) in each Wind Turbine Group within the Wind
Plant

2. Nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements must be provided

from one wind turbine at the maximal value of each of the four true cardinal
directions (i.e., the farthest true North, South, East, and West) in each Wind
Turbine Group within the Wind Plant.

3. The wind turbine nearest the capacity-weighted centroid of the Wind Plant

must also report nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements.


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

4. Ambient air temperature, ambient air pressure, and ambient air relative

humidity must be measured, at a minimum, at one location within the Wind
Plant (preferably as near to the capacity-weighted centroid of the Wind Plant
as possible) whose height above ground may be in the range of 2 m to 10 m
(or up to 50 m above mean sea level for offshore Wind Plants) and the
measurement height above ground (or mean sea level for offshore Wind
Plants) must be stated to within 10 cm

If any wind turbine within a Wind Turbine Group satisfies more than one of the data
points required in items 1-4 above, then it may be used to fulfill all conditions that it
satisfies (e.g., if the highest wind turbine in a Wind Turbine Group is also the farthest
North and the farthest East, it may be used to supply data for all three of these
categories). Where more than one turbine satisfies these conditions, preference
should be given to those turbines that will be least affected by Wind Plant (or Wind
Turbine Group) wake effect from the prevailing wind direction(s). Finally, where a
Wind Turbine Group contains 10 or fewer wind turbines only the nacelle-level data
from the highest wind turbine nacelle is required. The locations of wind turbines with
nacelle-level equipment providing data must be referenced to the static plant data
supplied locations identified in Section 4 above.

The Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the number of nacelle specific sensors
providing wind direction data at the Wind Plant meets or exceeds the requirements
above and that each sensor measures with minimum resolution to 1 degree and with
minimum accuracy to +/- 5 degrees.

The Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the Plant Wind Directions are determined
by either:

    -  Wind measuring equipment (e.g., wind vane) that is mounted in, on, or nearby

the nacelle/rotor assembly with reasonable attempt to minimize the effects of
rotor “prop-wash” or obstruction or

    -  Wind turbine nacelle yaw, corrected at all times to report wind direction

between 0 degrees and 359.9 degrees

The Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the number of nacelle specific sensors
providing wind speed data at a Wind Plant meets or exceeds the requirements
above. Wind speed measuring equipment must measure with minimum resolution to
0.1 m/s and must possess minimum accuracy of within 0.5 m/s over the range of 0
m/s to rated plus 1 m/s, and within 5% of reading above this range up to the highest
cut-out wind speed (e.g., the cut-out wind speed for a short term gust) plus 5 m/s.
For example if a wind turbine has cut-in, rated, and highest cut-out wind speeds of 3
m/s, 12 m/s, and 30 m/s, the wind speed measuring equipment on the nacelle must
have accuracy to within 0.5 m/s within the range of 0 m/s to 13 m/s, and within 5% of
reading over the range of 13 m/s to 35 m/s.

_5.1.2 Wind High Limit_

The Wind High Limit of a Wind Plant should be calculated as follows:


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

When a Wind Plant is not being Curtailed, its Wind High Limit shall be calculated to
be equal to the net generation.

When a Wind Plant is being Curtailed, its Wind High Limit shall be calculated to
equal the Wind Plant’s possible power production given current wind/weather
conditions and equipment status if the curtailment were not in place. This will be
greater than the net generation.

See Attachment B and Attachment E to this Appendix F for additional guidance and
examples.

_5.1.3 Real-Time High Operating Limit_

For purposes of clarity due to the unique nature of Wind Plants, a Wind Plant RealTime High Operating Limit (RTHOL) is the maximum power production (MW) the
Wind Plant would be capable of in real-time, given ideal wind conditions and no
Curtailment. (See Attachment B and Attachment E to this Appendix F for additional
guidance and examples).

Wind speeds should not affect the calculation of RTHOL; this includes both wind
speeds that are below cut-in as well as wind speeds that are above cut-out.

When icing, or other similar conditions occur, the RTHOL should be reduced to
reflect the generation capability given those conditions. If one or more turbines are
unable to produce energy given the conditions it should be reported equivalent to a
turbine outage.

_5.1.4 Wind Plant Future Availability_

Wind Plant Future Availability is equivalent to the future hour’s expected RTHOL and
should therefore be calculated using the same methodology as RTHOL but with the
expected turbine conditions for the hour being calculated.

In contrast to all other Real-Time data which is provided to the ISO via telemetry,
Wind Plant Future Availability is provided to the ISO using the ISO-NE Wind
Integration web services. This web service can also be used to gather wind plant
power forecasts provided by the ISO-NE wind power forecaster. Information on using
the web service platform, including data specification and sample files are available
in the following Zip file: https://www.iso-ne.com/static[assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sam](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)
[ple_files_AssetID_change.zip](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)

**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points and Practices**

In order to provide that data of a high quality will be incorporated into the centralized
forecasting system and allow for greater situational awareness, ISO recommends
that Wind Plant Operators follow the practices for data collection/calculation for each
Wind Plant as outlined below:

1. Collect and provide to ISO, Meteorological Data from at least one met tower or

other equivalent met equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment such as
SODAR or LIDAR) that is strategically placed or utilized so that it will be


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

impacted to a minimal extent by plant operations (i.e., it is generally capable of
providing “free stream” data).

2. The collection equipment should be capable of collecting measurements at, at

least, two heights (with the exception of air temperature, air pressure, and
relative humidity):

A. Turbine hub height

B. A second height at least 20 meters less than hub height.

3. The Met Gathering Station equipment should be located at well‐exposed sites

that are upwind of the Wind Plant and no closer than two rotor diameters to
the nearest wind turbine. It is recommended that each wind turbine in the
Wind Plant should be within 5 km of a met gathering station.

4. If ambient air temperature, ambient air pressure, and/or ambient air relative

humidity are measured by nacelle-level equipment, ISO prefers to receive any
of this data from all of the nacelles providing wind speed data, in addition to
the single plant-wide measurement required.

5. In order to avoid outage of data (e.g., from nacelle-level wind speeds) it is

recommended that additional “backup” nacelles are selected in addition to the
required data specified in Section 5.1.1 for the number of nacelles providing
data to simultaneously collect and transmit the required data. When this
recommendation is followed, as near as possible the “next most” wind turbine
in each group should be used to supply data (e.g., the second highest wind
turbine in a Wind Turbine Group, the second farthest North wind turbine in the
Wind Turbine Group, etc.) and the wind turbine locations should also be
referenced to the static plant data supplied location(s). If available, ISO
prefers to receive nacelle-level data from all the wind turbine nacelles within
the Wind Plant.

6. Nacelle-level Plant Wind Speeds should be measured by equipment that is

mounted in, on, or nearby the nacelle/rotor assembly with reasonable attempt
to minimize the effects of rotor “prop-wash”, obstruction, and nacelle speed-up
effects such that power output can be estimated to within 10% of actual using
suitable calibration and the turbine power curve(s)[3]).

7. Utilize the Do-Not-Exceed (DNE) Dispatch Limit provided by the ISO over the

RTU, along with the Wind Plant’s possible power production capability when
determining if the Wind Plant is operating in a Curtailed mode.

      - If the Wind Plant DNE limit is lower than the possible power production,

this may be considered a Curtailment.

3 See for example NREL/CP-500-32494 within Smith, et al: “Applicability of Nacelle Anemometer Measurements for

Use in Turbine Power Performance Tests,” NREL/CP-500-32494 available at:
[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/32494.pdf](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/32494.pdf)


-----

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

   - If the Wind Plant DNE limit is not lower than the possible power

production, this would not be considered a Curtailment.

8. Maximum leading and lagging reactive capabilities should reflect values that

can be reached within 1 minute and maintained for no less than 1 hour.

**Attachment E – RTHOL and WHL Calculation Examples**

The following examples are presented to illustrate how RTHOL and WHL would be
calculated under various conditions.

Wind speeds in the following examples are assumed to be constant. Variability of wind
conditions will likely introduce some error into the calculation of WHL; this is expected.
Losses between the wind turbine and the Point of Interconnection (POI) are not taken
into account in these simplified examples, but should be in the WHL calculation such
that the WHL reports the net power injection at the POI rather than the gross
production.

## Example 1:

**Individual Turbine Details**

Wind Possible Power
Turbine # Available RTHOL

Speed Production

Turbine 1: Yes 3 m/s 3.3 MW 0.0 MW

Turbine 2: Yes 5 m/s 3.3 MW 0.3 MW

Turbine 3 No 6 m/s 0.0 MW 0.0 MW

**Wind Plant Totals**

DNE Limit: 6.6 MW

Net Generation: 0.4 MW

Possible Power Production: 0.3 MW

RTHOL: 6.6 MW

WHL: 0.4 MW

**Explanation:**

Turbine 3 is not available so its RTHOL would be 0 MW. Even though the wind speed of
Turbine 3 would normally support 0.5 MW of generation, because it is not available, the
possible power production would also be 0 MW.

Turbines 1 and 2 are available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW even though
Turbine 1 is below the cut-in speed. The individual turbines possible power production are
determined using the power curve and wind speeds.

Adding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 6.6 MW.

Adding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the total possible power
production would be 0.3 MW, however, because the Wind Plant is not being curtailed
(e.g. their DNE is not limiting their total possible power production), the WHL should equal
the net generation so the WHL is calculated to be 0.4 MW. Given that the net generation
is 0.4 MW, which is higher than possible power production, this would indicate a potential
situation where the possible power production estimation does not have sufficient
information to perfectly estimate the net generation and is why the WHL should be
reported at 0.4 MW (because it is capable of generating 0.4 MW given the current
conditions).

|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes No|3 m/s 5 m/s 6 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 0.0 MW|0.0 MW 0.3 MW 0.0 MW|

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

## Example 2:

**Individual Turbine Details**

Wind Possible Power
Turbine # Available RTHOL

Speed Production

Turbine 1: Yes 8 m/s 3.3 MW 1.4 MW

Turbine 2: Yes 11 m/s 3.3 MW 3.0 MW

Turbine 3 Yes 10 m/s 3.3 MW 2.6 MW

**Wind Plant Totals**

DNE Limit: 5.0 MW

Net Generation: 5.0 MW

Possible Power Production: 7.0 MW

RTHOL: 9.9 MW

WHL: 7.0 MW

**Explanation:**

All three turbines are available so each RTHOL is 3.3 MW. Together that results in a
Wind Plant RTHOL of 9.9 MW.

Using the wind speeds at each turbine, the total possible power production is estimated
using the power curve to be 7.0 MW. The current DNE limit is 5.0 MW, meaning the wind
plant is currently being curtailed below what it could potentially achieve. Because it is
curtailed, the WHL should not match the net generation and would remain at 7 MW.

|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes|8 m/s 11 m/s 10 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 3.3 MW|1.4 MW 3.0 MW 2.6 MW|

Alternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F

## Example 3:

**Individual Turbine Details**

Wind Possible Power
Turbine # Available RTHOL

Speed Production

Turbine 1: Yes 10 m/s 3.3 MW 2.0 MW

Turbine 2: Yes 9 m/s 3.3 MW 2.6 MW

Turbine 3 Yes* 10 m/s 1.0 MW 1.0 MW

*Due to a small accumulation of ice on the blades of Wind Turbine 3, it has been limited
to 1 MW of generation by the Wind Plant Operator.

**Wind Plant Totals**

DNE Limit: 6.0 MW

Net Generation: 4.9 MW

Possible Power Production: 5.6 MW

RTHOL: 7.6 MW

WHL: 4.9 MW

**Explanation:**

Turbine 3 is available but limited to a maximum of 1 MW, so its RTHOL would be 1 MW.
Even though the wind speed of Turbine 3 would normally support 2.0 MW of generation,
because it is only available up to 1 MW, the possible power production would also be 1
MW.

Turbines 1 and 2 are fully available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW. The individual
turbines possible power production are determined using the power curve and wind
speeds.

Adding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 7.6 MW.

Adding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the plant total would be
5.6 MW. The DNE limit is currently 6.0 MW, which while is being lower than the RTHOL,
is above the 5.6 MW the wind plant is capable of producing, so it is not being curtailed.
Because it is not curtailed, the WHL should equal the net generation so the WHL is
calculated to be 4.9 MW.

|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes*|10 m/s 9 m/s 10 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 1.0 MW|2.0 MW 2.6 MW 1.0 MW|

## Example 4:

**Individual Turbine Details**

Wind Possible Power
Turbine # Available RTHOL

Speed Production

Turbine 1: Yes 22 m/s 3.3 MW 3.3 MW

Turbine 2: Yes 26 m/s 3.3 MW 0.0 MW

Turbine 3 Yes 23 m/s 3.3 MW 3.3 MW

**Wind Plant Totals**

DNE Limit: 6.0 MW

Net Generation: 4.9 MW

Possible Power Production: 6.6 MW

RTHOL: 9.9 MW

WHL: 6.6 MW

Explanation:

Turbine 2 is available so its RTHOL would be 3.3 MW even though, based on the wind
speed being above cut-out speed, the possible power production is 0.0 MW. The RTHOL
should still be reported as 3.3 MW as long as it is available, because if the wind speed
drops down within the operable range, the wind turbine would immediately be able to
begin generating again.

Turbines 1 and 3 are also available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW. The
individual turbines possible power production are determined using the power curve and
wind speeds.

Adding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 9.9 MW.

Adding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the total would be 6.6
MW. With a DNE limit of 6.0 MW, this would indicate the Wind Plant is being curtailed and
the WHL would be calculated to be 6.6 MW. Under this condition, the Wind Plant would
be normally be expected to increase the generation up to the DNE limit. If this were not
possible it would indicate an error in the possible power production calculation, and
subsequently WHL, which should be corrected to the amount of generation that was
possible, or 4.9 MW in this example.

|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes|22 m/s 26 m/s 23 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 3.3 MW|3.3 MW 0.0 MW 3.3 MW|

### I. Introduction

ISO New England (ISO), in conjunction with the System Restoration Working Group
(SRWG), is responsible for determining if the addition of a prospective new
blackstart resource provides significant benefit to the ISO New England System
Restoration Plan (System Restoration Plan). In order to determine the potential
benefits of a resource to the System Restoration Plan, a Market Participant must
submit the applicable portions of this application to ISO via the ISO Customer
Support Issue Tracking Process.

This Appendix provides the information used by ISO and the SRWG to evaluate a
resource for providing Blackstart service in the System Restoration Plan.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

Each responsible entity: ISO New England (ISO), Market Participant (MP), Transmission
Owner (TO) and Local Control Center (LCC), shall report an event that meets the threshold
for reporting based on the requirements of state regulatory agencies, the United States
Department of Energy (DOE), or the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).
This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes reporting requirements and guidance for ISO,
MPs, TOs, and LCCs. This OP does not alter reporting requirements set forth in relevant
NERC Reliability Standards.

Contact information for assistance in reporting can be found in Appendix A to this OP
(Federal and State Regulatory Agency Reports of Major System
Disturbance/Outage/Incident).

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

**II.** **GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING GUIDANCE**

Each applicable MP or TO shall notify ISO and/or its respective LCC when an event that
meets the threshold for reporting to a state regulatory agency, DOE, or NERC occurs. Such
notifications shall be made as outlined in Appendix B to this OP (Communications and
Reporting Matrix) and in accordance with the following:

     - The applicable MP shall notify the ISO control room by telephone through its assigned

Designated Entity or Demand Designated Entity

     - The applicable TO shall notify its LCC by telephone in accordance with applicable LCC

operating instructions
```
      o For events reported to meet DOE requirements only, the applicable TO shall also

```
notify the ISO control room by telephone

Where time allows within the reporting time period of the applicable NERC Reliability
Standard, in order for ISO to review the validity of the content in the report and its applicability
to the Bulk Electric System (BES):

     - MPs are encouraged to collaborate with ISO

     - TOs are encouraged to collaborate with their LCCs (and also with ISO, for DOE

reporting only)

When such collaboration is possible, the preferred means of report submittal within the
reporting time period shall be:

     - By ISO, for events identified by MPs (and also for events identified by TOs, for DOE

reporting only)

     - By the LCCs, for events identified by the TOs

If an MP or TO chooses to submit the report directly, at the time such report is submitted it
shall also be sent:

     - By the MP to ISO

     - By the TO to its LCC and, for DOE reporting only, also to ISO

Updates on any follow-up reporting shall be provided:

    - By the MP to ISO

     - By the TO to its LCC and, for DOE reporting only, also to ISO

While collaboration between entities is encouraged under this OP, responsibility for meeting
applicable reporting requirements and timelines remains with the entities experiencing the
event.

**III.** **LCC AND ISO REPORTING**

This section describes the reporting responsibilities of ISO and LCCs for events that meet the
applicable agency reporting threshold.

**A. LCC Reporting**

The applicable LCC shall notify ISO when an event occurs that meets the threshold of
reporting to one or more of the following organizations: state regulatory agency, DOE, or
NERC. Notification to ISO shall be by telephone to the Operations Shift Supervisor in the
ISO control room. Where time allows within the reporting time period of the applicable
NERC Reliability Standard, collaboration with ISO is encouraged to review the validity of
the content in the report and its applicability to the BES. In cases where such
collaboration is possible, it is preferable that ISO submit the report within the reporting
time period. If the LCC chooses to submit the report directly, that information shall be
communicated concurrently to ISO. The applicable LCC shall follow the reporting
communication path described in Appendix B to this OP (Communication and Reporting
Matrix) and provide status updates to appropriate parties. While collaboration with ISO is
encouraged under this OP, the LCCs remain responsible for ensuring that reporting
timelines under applicable reporting requirements are met.

**B. ISO Reporting**

ISO shall notify the applicable LCC when an event occurs that meets the threshold of
reporting to one or more of the following organizations: state regulatory agency, DOE,
NERC, or NPCC. ISO shall report to each applicable state regulatory agency using the
Director, Corporate, Media & Web Communications, or the Director, External Affairs or
their respective designees. When an event occurs that meets the threshold for reporting,
ISO shall communicate to all appropriate parties within the reporting time period.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

**IV.** **EVENTS REQUIRING ANALYSIS AND REPORTS**

ISO shall determine whether to conduct an analysis and prepare a report for a system condition
or disturbance that impacts the reliability of the BES as well as physical, cyber, and/or
communication system sabotage / attack event in accordance with ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 20 - Analysis and Reporting of Power System Incidents (OP-20).

Outage Scheduling (OP-5)

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing (OP-23),
Section IV - Reactive Capability Audits


-----

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

ISO New England (ISO), in consultation with the System Restoration Working
Group (SRWG), develops, maintains, and evaluates the New England System
Restoration Plan (Plan) for the New England Transmission System. The Plan is
described in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 - System Restoration
Plan (M/LCC 18).

Following a disturbance that causes a partial or total shutdown of the New
England Transmission System, Designated Blackstart Resources (DBRs) may be
used to begin system restoration.

ISO, in consultation with the SRWG, verifies that the quantity and location of
DBRs are sufficient to meet North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC), Northeast Power Coordinating Council, Inc. (NPCC), and ISO
restoration criteria in addition to the needs of the Plan. DBRs shall be
appropriately sized and located to facilitate an expeditious restoration following
the partial or total shutdown of the New England Transmission System.

A resource that meets, or may meet with conversion, the eligibility requirements
contained in the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services
Tariff (ISO Tariff), Section II, Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT),
Schedule 16 - Blackstart Service (Schedule 16) and this OP may be evaluated
by ISO and the SRWG to determine if that resource provides benefit to the Plan.
Either the Blackstart Owner or ISO may initiate the evaluation process to
determine whether a resource can provide a benefit to the Plan; however,
regardless of the initiation of the evaluation process, participation in Blackstart
Service is through voluntary mutual agreement between ISO and the Blackstart
Owner through the terms of a Blackstart Service Commitment.

The evaluation criteria to determine benefit to the Plan include (but are not
limited to) the resource:

    - Real power capability,

    - Reactive power capability,

    - Frequency control capability,

    - Voltage control capability,

    - Interconnection voltage,

    - Proximity to nuclear power plants,

    - Proximity to inter-Local Control Center (LCC) interconnection points,

    - Proximity to inter-Reliability Coordinator Area (RCA) interconnection
points,


-----

  - Time between system shutdown and resource availability for electrical
loading,

  - Geographic location.

Based upon this evaluation, a resource may become a DBR and be included in
the Plan.

This OP contains the requirements and procedures for the application,
assessment, selection, and testing of DBRs in accordance with Schedule 16. A
Blackstart Owner may obtain Blackstart Capability Test (Test) data for each DBR
in its portfolio, including the date of the last successful Test, from the monthly
updates on the ISO Market Information System (MIS).


-----

     - If the DBR is not continuously staffed, at both the DBR physical

location and the Designated Entity (DE) location.

**2. Application for Designation as a Blackstart Resource**

A. Resource Requiring Conversion to Meet Blackstart Service Minimum

Criteria

In order to provide Blackstart Service from a resource that does not meet
the Blackstart Service Minimum Criteria, a Blackstart Owner shall submit
an application for the resource to be converted to meet the Blackstart
Service Minimum Criteria and be accepted, by ISO, into the Plan. The
completed Initial Designated Blackstart Resource Application contained in
OP-11, App D, Section II shall be submitted to ISO via the ISO Customer
Support issue tracking system (ASK ISO).

1) Following receipt of the completed application:

a. ISO reviews the Blackstart Owner’s application and an agenda item

is created for inclusion at a regularly scheduled SRWG meeting to
evaluate the application.

b. The Blackstart Owner receives confirmation of receipt of the

application and the scheduled date of the SRWG meeting when the
application is to be discussed. The Blackstart Owner is not
required to attend this meeting.

2) ISO, in consultation with the SRWG, shall conduct an initial review of

the application and determine if the proposed DBR is expected to


-----

provide a benefit to the Plan. Following the completion of the review,
ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner of one of the following
determinations:

a. Preliminary Acceptance. ISO notifies the Blackstart Owner that the

resource may provide a benefit to the Plan.

b. Request Additional Information. If ISO or the SRWG require

additional information to complete the initial review of the
application, ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner that insufficient
data was submitted to render an assessment and request the
necessary information. If the requested information is not provided
within 30 calendar days or as otherwise agreed upon, ISO may
reject the application.

c. Rejection. ISO notifies the Blackstart Owner of the rejection of the

application and provides the reason for the rejection. The
explanation of the application rejection shall be bound by the
constraints of the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and
Services Tariff (ISO Tariff), Section I, Attachment D - ISO New
England Information Policy (ISO Information Policy).

3) Following Preliminary Acceptance:

a. The Transmission Owner (TO), through the appropriate LCC shall

submit required technical data, as requested by the SRWG, to
support detailed restoration studies.

b. The Blackstart Owner shall submit technical data detailed in

OP-11, App D Section III Follow-Up System Designated Blackstart
Resource Application or as further directed by ISO.

c. ISO, in conjunction with the LCCs, shall determine if the proposed

DBR meets the needs of the Plan by conducting detailed technical
restoration studies.

d. If it is determined, through ISO and LCC studies, that the proposed

DBR can meet the requirements of the Plan, ISO and the Blackstart
Owner of the proposed DBR may enter into an agreement for the
Blackstart Owner to perform conversion studies. This agreement is
found in OP-11, Appendix G, - Designated Blackstart Resource
Commitment (App G), Section II - ISO and Blackstart Owner
Commitment Prior to Conversion Studies. The Blackstart Owner
shall then conduct conversion feasibility studies to determine the
technical requirements for blackstart conversion.

4) Upon completion of the feasibility studies:

a. The Blackstart Owner shall provide copies of the study report to

ISO;


-----

b. The SRWG shall discuss the feasibility study at the next regularly

scheduled meeting. If necessary, ISO may schedule the Blackstart
Owner to present and discuss the submitted data and information at
that SRWG meeting.

5) The SRWG shall assess the submitted material and recommend to

ISO whether to accept or reject the proposed DBR conversion to
blackstart capability. ISO and/or the SRWG may request more
information from the Blackstart Owner to complete this assessment.
The additional data shall be provided by the Blackstart Owner prior to a
mutually agreed upon date. The assessment shall be completed within
60 calendar days of the date of the SRWG meeting at which the
feasibility study was discussed or from the date of receipt of any
additional data requested, whichever is later. ISO shall accept or reject
the application for conversion based upon the evaluation of all
information provided by the Blackstart Owner and the assessment
results of the SRWG.

6) If the resource is accepted into the Plan, ISO shall notify the Blackstart

Owner and the M/LCC Heads. To commence conversion, the
Blackstart Owner and ISO shall enter into a Blackstart Service
Commitment, in the form contained in OP-11, App G, Section III Designated Blackstart Resource Commitment. The Blackstart Owner
shall provide periodic updates of conversion progress to ISO.
Following successful conversion, the Blackstart Owner shall follow
Section 3.A of this OP to schedule the initial Test. The initial Test shall
be observed by at least one member of the SRWG. Upon successful
completion of this initial Test, the Blackstart Owner shall notify the LCC
and ISO. The effective date of the Blackstart Service Commitment for
both compensation and commitment length shall be the first day of the
month following the successful Test.

7) In the event that ISO determines that the resource will not be accepted

into the Plan, ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner and provide an
explanation for the determination. The explanation shall be bound by
the constraints of the ISO Information Policy. In this case, the
Blackstart Owner shall be eligible to receive Non-DBR Study Cost
reimbursement in accordance with Schedule 16.

8) If the Blackstart Owner determines that the resource will not continue

with blackstart conversion and provide Blackstart Service, the
Blackstart Service Commitment shall be terminated and the Blackstart
Owner shall not be eligible to receive Non-DBR Study Cost
reimbursement in accordance with Schedule 16.

B. Resource Not Requiring Conversion to Meet Blackstart Service Minimum

Criteria


-----

A Blackstart Owner, with a resource that meets the Blackstart Service
Minimum Criteria and is offering that resource to provide Blackstart
Service, shall submit a completed OP-11, App D, Section II - Initial

item shall be included at a regularly scheduled SRWG meeting to
evaluate the application;

b. The Blackstart Owner shall receive confirmation of receipt of the

application and the scheduled date of the SRWG meeting when the
application is to be discussed. The Blackstart Owner is not
required to attend this meeting.

2) ISO, in consultation with the SRWG, shall conduct an initial review of

the application and determine if the proposed DBR is expected to
provide a benefit to the Plan. Following the completion of the review,
ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner of one of the following
determinations:

a. Preliminary Acceptance. ISO notifies the Blackstart Owner that the

proposed DBR may provide a benefit to the Plan.

b. Request Additional Information. If ISO and/or the SRWG require

additional information to complete the initial review of the
application, ISO notifies the Blackstart Owner that insufficient data
was submitted to render an assessment and requests the
necessary information. If the requested information is not provided
within 30 calendar days (unless otherwise agreed upon) ISO may
reject the application.

c. Rejection. ISO notifies the Blackstart Owner of the rejection of the

application and provides the reason for the rejection. The
explanation of the application rejection shall be bound by the
constraints of the ISO Information Policy.

3) Following Preliminary Acceptance:

upon date. The assessment shall be completed within 60 calendar
days of the date of the SRWG meeting at which the feasibility study
was discussed or from the date of receipt of any additional data
requested, whichever is later. ISO shall accept or reject the proposed
DBR based upon the evaluation of all information provided by the
Blackstart Owner and the assessment results of the SRWG.

a. If the application is accepted, ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner

and the M/LCC Heads. A Blackstart Owner that chooses to enter
the resource into the Plan shall follow Section 3.A of this OP to
schedule the initial Test. The initial Test shall be observed by at
least one member of the SRWG. Upon successful completion of
the initial Test, the Blackstart Owner shall notify the LCC and ISO.
ISO and the Blackstart Owner may enter into a Blackstart Service
Commitment in the form contained in OP-11, App G. The effective
date of the Blackstart Service Commitment shall be the first day of
the month following the successful Test.

b. In the event that ISO determines that the resource will not be

accepted into the Plan, ISO shall notify the Blackstart Owner and
provide an explanation for the determination. The explanation shall
be bound by the constraints of the ISO Information Policy.

**3. Blackstart Resource Program Administration and Requirements**

A. Testing and Reporting Requirements

Each DBR that provides Blackstart Service shall have completed a
successful Test, and meet testing and reporting requirements, within the
past 12 months.

To perform a successful Test, a Blackstart Owner shall:

1) Coordinate with the applicable TO to ensure that any required

transmission outage requests for equipment necessary to isolate the
DBR or equipment necessary to be energized during the testing are
submitted through the transmission outage coordination process.

2) Submit an outage application in the ISO’s outage scheduling software.

Requests shall come through the generator outage request process.


-----

In the event that the Test would not impact generator startup or
notification times, an informational application shall still be submitted
through the ISO’s outage scheduling software.
```
   o The SRWG shall review the impact of outage applications for

```
testing pursuant to M/LCC 11 - Verification of New England System
Restoration Plan

3) Request and receive permission from ISO and applicable LCC control

rooms prior to commencing the Test.

4) Start the DBR without support from either offsite power or another

DBR.

5) Verify that the DBR is ready for electrical loading within the stated

response time specification declared in OP-11, App D after Test
initiation.

6) Demonstrate stable operation of the DBR for a minimum of 10 minutes

while it remains isolated.

7) Test operating aids and auxiliary systems required for DBR operation.

8) Verify that emergency communications circuits are operable by

contacting ISO or the applicable LCC during the Test.

9) Verify that the DBR output circuit breaker can be closed into a de
energized bus by energizing a de-energized transmission element or
generating station switchyard element if that energization does not
involve the disconnection of load that is not dedicated generating
station load to conduct the test. ISO, the LCC, and the Blackstart
Owner shall coordinate to determine the appropriate element to be
energized. If the energization would require disconnection of load that
is not dedicated generating station load, the output circuit breaker shall
be verified as capable of closing to a de-energized bus. Verification
may take the form of energizing the closing coil with the frequency and
voltage monitoring circuits disconnected, or any other acceptable
physical verification of breaker closing ability.

10) Verbally report the result of the Test to ISO and applicable LCC control

rooms within 15 minutes of the completion of the Test (this notification
is typically performed at the same time that the outage application end
time is provided to ISO and the LCC). Test failures require the
submittal of an application reflecting loss of blackstart capability in the
ISO’s outage scheduling software. Failures shall be corrected as soon
as possible.

ISO shall:

1) Study and respond to the Test request;


-----

2) Verify that the DBR is declared out-of-service during the outage as

necessary.

Within 30 calendar days following completion of the Test, the Lead Market
Participant (Lead MP) shall submit the following by email to blackstart@isone.com:

1) A complete OP-11, Appendix E - Designated Blackstart Resource Test

Log (App E), using OP-11, Appendix F - Instructions for Completing the
Designated Blackstart Resource Test Log (App F).

2) A copy of the local generator test procedure used to perform the

blackstart test.

A Blackstart Owner may submit documented demonstration of actual
blackstart performance that meets the requirements for a successful Test as
documented in OP-11, App E. The Blackstart Owner shall comply with the
audit testing verbal communication and audit documentation requirements for
consideration of Test compliance.

ISO or the SRWG have the right to be present during the performance of a
Test and to inspect aspects of the DBR, including procedures and records,
that pertain to the operation and maintenance of Blackstart Service.

B. Requirements for Performance During a System Restoration

DBRs are an integral portion of any system restoration; therefore, any
DBR that is not on an outage in accordance with ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource Maintenance and Outage
Scheduling (OP-5), regardless of Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO)
status, shall be maintained such that it can meet the Blackstart Service
Minimum Criteria at all times.

During a system restoration, a DBR shall be able to:

1) Start up and remain energized without support from either offsite power

or another DBR

2) Self-supply its own load for stable operation

3) Be ready to receive transmission load, at the direction of ISO or the

LCC, as soon as possible but definitely within the stated response time
specification from OP-11, App D and measured from the time of
system shutdown

4) Close its output circuit breaker to a de-energized bus, as instructed

5) Support the process of energizing transmission by providing real

power, reactive power, frequency support, and voltage support.


-----

**4. Failure to Meet Blackstart Service Obligations**

DBRs are the cornerstone of the Plan. As such:

1) Any inability to provide Blackstart Service shall be reported to ISO and

the applicable LCC control rooms by the DE within 15 minutes of
identifying the inability to provide Blackstart Service.

2) Notification shall also be emailed by the Lead MP to ISO within 30

calendar days at: blackstart@iso-ne.com

ISO shall assess all information associated with a DBR inability to meet its
Blackstart Service Minimum Criteria and Blackstart Service obligations. If ISO
determines, based on that assessment that a Failure to Maintain Blackstart
Capability or a Failure to Perform During a System Restoration event
(collectively or individually a “Failure”) has occurred, ISO shall notify the
Blackstart Owner. A Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage (as defined in
OP-5) that has been applied for and approved in accordance with OP-5 shall
**not be considered a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability, except for a**
Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage that extends past its original planned
duration by more than five calendar days. If a Planned Outage or
Maintenance Outage extends past its original planned duration by more than
five calendar days, then, at 0001 of the sixth calendar day, the DBR shall be
considered to be in a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability status. A
Planned Outage, Maintenance Outage, or Forced Outage that is the direct
result of a transmission outage shall not be considered a Failure to Maintain
Blackstart Capability until the transmission outage has been completed. In
addition to providing the outage details through the outage scheduling
process of OP-5, the Blackstart Owner shall email notification of Forced
Outages or extensions to Maintenance Outages or Planned Outages to ISO
at blackstart@iso-ne.com.

Upon correction of the Failure:

1) The Blackstart Owner shall notify the ISO and each appropriate LCC

control room of the correction.

2) The Blackstart Owner shall email notification of the correction to

[blackstart@iso-ne.com.](mailto:blackstart@iso-ne.com)

3) ISO shall promptly provide acknowledgement of the correction

notification.


-----

**5. Blackstart Service Commitment Termination**

A DBR Blackstart Service Commitment may be terminated either by mutual
agreement or by unilateral termination by ISO or the Blackstart Owner. The
termination notification shall be in accordance with Schedule 16 and shall be
submitted to ISO through ASK ISO. Following the termination date, ISO and
the resource shall no longer be obligated under Schedule 16, this OP or the
Plan.

119,"# Appendix B - Scheduling Reductions and Curtailments of
 Real-Time External Transactions

 Effective Date: May 24, 2023

 Review By Date: May 24, 2025

**A.** **Scheduling Reductions Under Ramp Constraints**

If a ramp constraint exists that must be mitigated during the scheduling process, the following
rules shall apply:

1. Reductions to eliminate the ramp constraint will be made to External Transactions on all

selected external interfaces simultaneously using the same methodology.

2. Transactions helping the ramp constraint will be excluded from the ramp constraint

evaluation. Therefore, External Transactions flowing in the opposite direction of the ramp
constraint will be excluded from the ramp constraint evaluation. In addition, External
Transactions flowing in the same direction as the ramp constraint but that have a MW value
that is changing in the opposite direction of the ramp constraint will continue to be scheduled
(e.g., an import transaction is changing from 100 MW to 50 MW during an import ramp
constraint).

3. Wheel-through transactions will be excluded from the ramp constraint evaluation.

4. All External Transactions will be categorized into one or two of the four groups described

below:

Group 1: External Transactions submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market and

whose schedule is directly impacting the ramp constraint (e.g., an import
transaction is changing from 0 MW to 150 MW during an import ramp
constraint).

Group 2: External Transactions submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market and

whose schedule is not changing during the time of the ramp constraint.

Group 3: External Transactions that have cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, have a

corresponding transaction submitted into the Real-Time Energy Market under the
same transaction identifier and whose schedule is directly impacting the ramp
constraint (e.g., an import transaction is changing from 0 MW to 150 MW during
an import ramp constraint).

Group 4: External Transactions that have cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, have a

corresponding transaction submitted into the Real-Time Energy Market under the
same transaction identifier and whose schedule is not changing during the time of
the ramp constraint.

5. The scheduling under the ramp constraint will occur as described below:

a) A single External Transaction can have MW in one or two of the groups described above

(e.g., an External Transactions that is submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market


-----

whose schedule is changing from 100 MW to 150 MW would have 50 MW in Group 1
and 100 MW in Group 2).

b) Reductions will be made to Group 1 first, Group 2 second, Group 3 third and then to

Group 4. All the MW from External Transactions within one group will be reduced to
zero MW before utilizing any MW from a subsequent group.

c) If only a portion of the MW within a group are required to resolve the ramp constraint,

the evaluation of all External Transactions within that group to determine which
transactions are reduced shall be made in a manner consistent with the normal
scheduling rules – economics, priority and timestamp.

**B.** **Scheduling Reductions and Curtailments Related to A Minimum Generation Emergency**

1. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on import External Transactions

submitted under III.1.10.7A that would create or worsen a Minimum Generation
Emergency, the External Transactions will be impacted on the basis of economic merit
order, where a tie in economics will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.

2. When scheduling reductions or curtailment are required on import External Transactions

submitted under III.1.10.7 that would create or worsen a Minimum Generation Emergency
the following rules will be applied:

a) If a Minimum Generation Emergency Warning has been issued and a reduction is

required to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have not also cleared
the Day-Ahead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions shall first
consider price where the most expensive transactions are reduced first. If there is a tie in
price, the transaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker where those with the lowest
priority are reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time Energy
Market timestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker, where the most
recent submittals are reduced first.

b) If a Minimum Generation Emergency has been declared and after reductions have been

made to transactions not cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, if a reduction is then
required to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have cleared the DayAhead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions shall first consider
price. However, the price associated with all Real-Time Energy Market External
Transactions that have cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market are equal and the
transaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker, where those with the lowest priority
are reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time Energy Market
timestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker where the most recent
submittals are reduced first.

**C. Scheduling Reductions and Curtailments Related to Capacity Deficient Conditions**

1. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on export External Transactions

submitted under III.1.10.7A that would create or worsen a capacity deficient condition, the
External Transactions will be reduced on the basis of economic merit order, where a tie in
economics will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.


-----

2. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on export External Transactions

submitted under III.1.10.7 that would create or worsen a capacity deficient condition for the
overall New England RCA/BAA the following rules will be applied.

a) Export External Transactions with the Special Exception Non-CSO Export that satisfy

III.1.10.7(i) will be excluded from this process:

b) If a reduction is required to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have

not cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions
shall first consider price where the least expensive transactions are reduced first. If there
is a tie in price, the transaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker where those with
the lowest priority are reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time
Energy Market timestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker where the
most recent submittals are reduced first.

c) If OP-4 has been declared and after reductions have been made to transactions that did

not clear the Day-Ahead Energy Market, if a reduction is then required to Real-Time
Energy Market External Transactions that have cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market,
the reduction to that group of transactions shall first consider price. However, if the price
associated with all Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have cleared the
Day-Ahead Energy Market are equal, the transaction priority shall be used as the
tiebreaker, where those with the lowest priority are reduced first. If there is a tie in
transaction priority, the Real-Time Energy Market timestamp of the transaction shall be
used as the tiebreaker where the most recent submittals are reduced first.

**PART I - INTRODUCTION**

In addition to the Resources required to meet the New England Reliability Coordinator
Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) load, Operating Reserve is required to
reliably operate the New England RCA/BAA. Operating Reserve requirements
address:

1. Loss of generating equipment within the New England RCA/BAA or within any

other Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) RCA/BAA.

2. Loss of transmission equipment within or between NPCC RCA/BAAs that may

result in a reduction of energy transfer capability within the New England
RCA/BAA or between the New England RCA/BAA and any other RCA/BAA.

3. Regulation in the New England RCA/BAA.

4. Errors in forecasting New England RCA/BAA loads.

This Operating Procedure (OP) sets forth criteria for the establishment and
administration of Operating Reserve and Regulation in the New England RCA/BAA.

The objective is to ensure that the New England RCA/BAA Bulk Electric System
(BES) is operated at the level of reliability prescribed in North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC), NPCC and ISO New England (ISO) criteria.


-----

-----

**PART III - PROCEDURE**

**I.** **REAL-TIME** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENTS**

A. Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement

During normal conditions, ISO shall maintain a quantity of ten-minute reserve
at least equal to the amount required to replace the First Contingency Loss in
the New England RCA/BAA. In order to meet the NERC Disturbance Control
Standard, the ISO Chief Operating Officer (COO) (or designee) may add a
non-performance factor to the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement based on
historic Resource performance.

The energy associated with Regulation Reserves (Section VI) that is available
within ten (10) minutes may be used to satisfy the Ten-Minute Reserve
Requirement. Every available Resource of generating capability, including
select Regulation Resources, DARDs, and capability made available by other
qualifying load management techniques shall be considered for activation in an
effort to maintain the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement at all times.

1. TMSR Requirement

One hundred percent (100%) of the New England RCA/BAA Ten-Minute
Reserve Requirement shall be synchronized reserve except as described
below.

         - To the extent that, in the judgment of the ISO’s COO (or designee),

the New England RCA/BAA BES can be operated within NERC,
NPCC, and ISO-established reliability criteria.

        - The TMSR Requirement may be decreased to a minimum of twenty
five percent (25%) of the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement, in
accordance with the following relationships:
```
           o The maximum TMSR Requirement shall be one hundred

```
percent (100%) of the New England RCA/BAA Ten-Minute
Reserve Requirement.
```
           o The TMSR Requirement shall increase by twenty percent

```
(20%) for every time ISO fails to return the New England
RCA/BAA ACE to pre-contingency values or to zero (0) within
fifteen (15) minutes when ISO experiences a contingency
greater than or equal to the NPCC Reportable Event[1]
threshold that is less than a NERC reportable Balancing
Contingency Event.
```
           o The TMSR Requirement may decrease by a maximum of

```
twenty percent (20%) of the Ten-Minute Reserve
Requirement, per month following the implementation month
of any TMSR requirement increase.

1 Reportable Event is defined in the NPCC Glossary of Terms.


-----

Changes in the TMSR Requirement caused by ISO performance in
returning the New England RCA/BAA ACE to pre-contingency values or to
zero (0) within fifteen (15) minutes following an NPCC Reportable Event
shall be calculated by the twentieth day of each month, for the previous
month, and shall be applied at the beginning of the next month. The ISO’s
COO (or designee) may increase the TMSR Requirement above the
amounts specified by the above provisions.

If warranted to ensure recovery from a contingency, and to comply with
established criteria, ISO shall, to the extent possible, activate Operating
Reserve based on economic priority. Should reliable operation of the
power system require it, ISO shall, as it deems necessary, activate
Operating Reserve.

During periods when system conditions threaten to reduce actual tenminute reserve and/or TMSR quantity below the current prescribed levels,
the actual Ten-Minute Reserve and/or TMSR Requirement may be
increased by System Operators[2] to a value greater than 100% of the
current requirement in order to maintain system reliability.

B. TMOR Requirement

In addition to the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement, ISO shall maintain a
quantity of TMOR at least equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Second
Contingency Loss. Any excess ten-minute reserve may be counted as ThirtyMinute Reserve.

During periods when system conditions threaten to reduce ten-minute reserve
below prescribed levels, TMOR shall be re-dispatched to maintain ten-minute
reserve.

During periods when system conditions threaten to reduce actual TMOR
quantity below the current prescribed levels, the actual TMOR Requirement
may be increased by System Operators to a value greater than 100% of the
current requirement in order to maintain system reliability.

C. Zonal Forward Reserve Requirements

Zonal Forward Reserve requirements are established for Reserve Zones and
are further explained in Section III.9.2.2 of the Tariff. Zonal Forward Reserve
requirements reflect the need for 30-minute contingency response to provide
2[nd] contingency protection for each import-constrained Reserve Zone. Zonal
Forward Reserve requirements may be satisfied only by Resources that are
located within a Reserve Zone and that are capable of providing 30-minute or
higher quality reserve products.

**II.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **DISTRIBUTION**

Operating Reserve shall be distributed so that it can be fully utilized by ISO, for

2 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

any probable contingency without exceeding transmission system limitations. This
distribution shall also allow operation in accordance with NERC, NPCC, and ISO
Manuals, operating policies and procedures.

**III.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **RESTRICTIONS**

ISO shall be responsible for designating the First Contingency Loss and the
Second Contingency Loss in the New England RCA/BAA. Frequent review of
system configurations shall be conducted so that all probable capability losses,
that could be caused by a First Contingency Loss and resulting relay actions, are
considered.

When a generating resource is the largest First Contingency Loss in the New
England RCA/BAA, and therefore used to calculate the Ten-Minute Reserve
Requirement, the capability of the resource, in excess of its output, cannot be
considered as Operating Reserve. However, when a generating resource is the
largest Second Contingency Loss in the New England RCA/BAA, the net capability
of the resource, in excess of its output, may be considered as Operating Reserve.

When allocating Operating Reserve to the various Resources throughout the New
England RCA/BAA, ISO shall pay particular attention to temporary limitations and
de-ratings. Only that capability that can actually supply MW in the applicable
period shall be classified as Operating Reserve.

Operating Reserve, if activated, shall be sustainable for at least one (1) hour from
the time of activation or the published NERC/NPCC criteria.  It is recognized that
Resources called upon to activate Operating Reserve will operate without relief
until ISO determines that they are no longer needed.

**IV.** **SHORTAGE** **OF** **OPERATING** **RESERVE**

Normally, Operating Reserve shall be provided to prescribed levels of
synchronized and non-synchronized reserve from within the New England
RCA/BAA. If available capability is insufficient to provide adequate Operating
Reserve, ISO shall implement the various Actions of ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4), as appropriate to
maintain Operating Reserve requirements. During shortages of Operating
Reserve, TMOR shall be re-dispatched to maintain ten-minute reserve at the
prescribed value.

In the event that ISO is arranging to purchase available emergency capacity and
energy, or energy only, in accordance with OP-4, and a shortage of ten-minute
reserve is forecast, ISO will recognize that voltage reduction load relief available in
ten minutes (10) provides non-synchronized Operating Reserve.

**V.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **-** **CAPABILITY** **UNDER** **TEST** **CONDITIONS**

Frequently, some capability is used to supply energy needs while it is in a test
condition. This test energy normally is not released for ISO dispatch and shall be
added, megawatt-for-megawatt, to the Operating Reserve requirement. However,
based on the assumed degree of risk for the sudden loss of the total energy, ISO
may recognize the test energy risk as being similar to other non-test capability and


-----

count the test energy as firm. In such cases, Operating Reserve requirements
need not be increased due to the test energy.

**VI.** **REGULATION** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENT**

ISO shall maintain a portion of its synchronized capability on Regulation sufficient
to satisfy the NERC Control Performance Standard.[3] The specific Regulation
requirements are identified in the Markets and Operations/ISO
[Express/Operations Reports/Generation section of the ISO New England website.](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/operations/-/tree/daily-regulation-requirement)

**VII.** **REAL-TIME** **REPLACEMENT** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENT**

In addition to the Operating Reserve requirements, ISO shall maintain a quantity
of Replacement Reserve in the form of additional TMOR for the purposes of
meeting the NERC requirement to restore its ten-minute reserve.

ISO will not activate emergency procedures, such as OP-4 or ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7), in order to maintain
the Replacement Reserve Requirement.

If, in the judgment of the ISO’s COO (or designee), the New England RCA/BAA
may be operated within NERC, NPCC, and ISO established criteria, the
Replacement Reserve requirement may be decreased to zero based upon ISO’s
capability to restore ten-minute reserve to be within the NERC requirements.

**VIII.** **TESTING** **OF** **RESPONSE** **RATES**

As outlined in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing
(OP-23), ISO has the responsibility to conduct tests of response rates of both
synchronized and non-synchronized Resources.

The ability of Resources to demonstrate Operating Reserve capability shall be
tested at regular intervals. ISO shall attempt to coordinate these tests within
system conditions and Market Participants' normal testing practices.

**IX.** **RESPONSIBILITY**

**ISO is responsible for operating the New England RCA/BAA in accordance with**
established NERC, NPCC, and ISO criteria. This includes the responsibility for
determining when Operating Reserve above minimum levels prescribed shall be
retained. Further, ISO is responsible for determining how best to meet Regulation
criteria and to manage tie-line flows, including flow deviations resulting from
contingencies.

**ISO is also responsible for identifying the First Contingency Loss and the Second**
Contingency Loss; for determining the required amount of Operating Reserve; for
specifying the type, location, and quantity to be maintained; for selecting the
number of Resources as well as the location of Resources to be assigned to
Regulation; for determining the required amount of Replacement Reserve, and for

3 Control Performance Standard is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards


-----

communicating to the Resources for activating Operating Reserve in response to
contingencies in the New England RCA/BAA and/or external NPCC RCAs/BAAs.

**LOCAL CONTROL CENTERS (LCCs)/MARKET PARTICIPANTS (MPs) are**
responsible for communicating to ISO current system conditions affecting
Operating Reserve. The LCCs/MPs are also responsible for activating Operating
Reserve for localized problems within a local area when time does not permit
communication with ISO. When Operating Reserve is used by any LCC, ISO is to
be notified as soon as practicable, and ISO shall take action to restore Operating
Reserve as soon as possible.

Appendix A - Instructions for Implementation of Manual Load Shedding


-----

**PART I - INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes criteria to be followed in the event of an
operating Emergency involving unusually low frequency, equipment overload,
capacity or energy deficiency, unacceptable voltage levels, or any other Emergency
that ISO New England (ISO) deems appropriate in either an isolated, or widespread,
area of New England. The objectives in establishing these Emergency actions are:

1. To protect reliable operation of the Eastern Interconnection.

2. To restore balance between customers' load and available generation in

the shortest practicable time.

3. To minimize risk of damage to equipment.

4. To minimize interruption of customer service.

**PART II - RESPONSIBILITY**

**I.** **ISO New England Responsibility**

ISO has the responsibility and authority, in accordance with North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, Northeast Power
Coordinating Council, Inc. (NPCC) Directories, the ISO New England Inc.
Transmission, Markets, and Service Tariff, applicable Transmission Operating
Agreements and ISO OPs, including but not limited to ISO New England
Operating Procedure No.1 - Central Dispatch Operating Responsibilities and
Authority (OP-1), to issue Operating Instructions that may be required for the
implementation of this OP, such as load shedding or opening of circuits, when
the Emergency situation involves:

A. An overall capacity or energy deficiency in the New England Reliability

Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area[1] (RCA/BAA) or in any area within
the New England RCA/BAA.

B. The New England RCA/BAA interconnections with adjacent RCA/BAA

systems.

C. Conditions on facilities external to New England caused by operations or

conditions within the New England RCA/BAA.

D. Transmission and/or generating facilities within the New England RCA/BAA.

E. Any other Emergency conditions where ISO determines it appropriate.

1 Reliability Coordinator Area, Balancing Authority Area and Operating Instruction are defined in the

NERC Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

**II.** **Local Control Center Responsibility**

Each Local Control Center (LCC) has the responsibility and authority, in
accordance with NERC Reliability Standards, NPCC Directories, applicable
Transmission Operating Agreements and ISO OPs, including but not limited to
OP-1, to issue Operating Instructions that may be required for the
implementation of this OP when the Emergency condition involves:

A. A capacity or energy deficiency in an area wholly within the operating

jurisdiction of that LCC.

B. The transmission and/or generating facilities under the operating jurisdiction

of that LCC.

C. The risk of damage to equipment under the operating jurisdiction of that LCC

when accompanied by a loss of communications with ISO.

**PART III - PROCEDURE**

**I.** **Preparation For Implementation**

This OP may be implemented before, during or after action taken under ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During A Capacity Deficiency
(OP-4) or ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 21 – Operational Surveys,
Energy Forecasting & Reporting and Actions During An Energy Emergency (OP21), depending on the circumstances of the Emergency. Normally, the potential
need for Emergency actions prescribed by this OP should be determined well in
advance of the time the actions must be implemented. However, implementation
of OP-4 will typically precede implementation of this OP.

When system conditions indicate that implementation of this OP may be
necessary, ISO and the LCCs shall establish and, if appropriate, maintain
continuous communication in preparation for ISO to implement this OP. Prompt
action may provide time to be more selective in the implementation of this OP.

If any LCC and ISO are unable to establish prompt communication, the LCC shall
proceed to implement this OP independently.

When time and circumstances allow, ISO and the LCCs shall discuss the
Emergency conditions and reach consensus on the actions to be taken and the
timing of those actions.

When operating circumstances do not allow time for consensus decisions, ISO
and/or the LCC shall initiate the necessary actions prescribed by this OP with the
understanding that actions resulting in the highest possible level of reliability shall
be taken.


-----

**II.** **Procedures for Low Frequency Conditions**

In an Emergency characterized by a frequency drop, identification of the deficient
RCA/BAA or RCAs/BAAs is vital to expedite corrective action. ISO System
Operators[2] shall establish communications with other interconnected RCAs/BAAs
as follows, to determine if possible, the cause of the frequency decline and the
action required to restore frequency to 60.00 Hz.

**NOTE**

Some of the actions will occur automatically regardless of the RCA/BAA causing
the frequency decline.

A. When the cause of the declining frequency is outside of the New England

RCA/BAA, ISO shall:

     - Confirm existing interchange schedules with adjacent NPCC BAAs.

     - Regulate the New England RCA/BAA ties to maintain the Frequency
Biased Interchange Schedules.

     - Increase the amount of Synchronized Reserve to be able to adjust the

Interchange Schedule further, if needed.

     - Make known to external RCAs/BAAs the amount of emergency capacity

ISO can make available.

     - Actions described below may be implemented when external RCAs/BAAs

request assistance from ISO.

B. When the cause of the declining frequency is due to a deficiency in the New

England RCA/BAA:

     - Confirm existing Interchange Schedules with adjacent NPCC BAAs.

     - Request assistance from external RCAs/BAAs up to the emergency

transfer limit of the interconnection Tie Lines.

C. When the frequency declines to 59.90 Hz, ISO shall:

     - Disconnect any pumped storage Dispatchable Asset Related Demand(s)

(DARDs) operating in the pumping mode. They will be automatically
disconnected at 59.65 Hz.

     - Dispatch non-synchronized Fast Start Generators and Fast Start Demand

Response Resources (DRRs) as required.

D. When the frequency declines to 59.80 Hz ISO shall:

     - Suspend Automatic Generation Control (AGC).

2 System Operator is defined in the NERC Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.


-----

**NOTE**

Transmission limitations or other reliability criteria may not allow the dispatch of
all generators to Economic Maximum Limit (Economic Max).

  - Issue an Operating Instruction to all generators to go to Economic Max at

maximum response rates, as appropriate.

E. When the frequency declines to 59.50 Hz:

  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide 7% load relief.

  - Underfrequency relays (10 second anti-stall) shall provide an additional

2% load relief

F. When the frequency declines to 59.30 Hz:

  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.

G. When the frequency declines to 59.10 Hz:

  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.

H. When the frequency declines to 58.90 Hz:

  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.

**NOTE**

Up to 50% of the New England RCA/BAA load, including the 30% that is shed
automatically, can be shed manually. Details of the manual load shedding
procedure and statements to be used by System Operators are included in
Appendix A to this OP.

I. If the load shedding by automatic underfrequency relays does not stabilize

the frequency and it continues to decline below 58.50 Hz:

  - If currently synchronized to the Eastern Interconnection, ISO shall issue

an Operating Instruction for manual load shedding in accordance with
Appendix A to this OP to the extent necessary to restore Area Control
Error (ACE) to zero.

  - If not currently synchronized to the Eastern Interconnection, ISO shall

issue an Operating Instruction for manual load shedding in accordance
with Appendix A to this OP to the extent necessary to restore frequency to
60.00 Hz.

  - All generators shall take necessary action per NPCC Directory # 2

Emergency Operations, including separating generators from the system,
to preserve generation and minimize damage and service interruptions.


-----

**III.** **Procedures for a Transmission Emergency**

Operation of the transmission system under Emergency Conditions shall be
governed by ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission
Operations (OP-19). To maintain system reliability, ISO and the LCCs may take
Emergency actions, including the switching of transmission elements,
implementing voltage reductions, and the shedding of firm load.

ISO and the LCC System Operators shall keep operations management at ISO
and the LCCs advised as to conditions that might necessitate review of the need
to implement Emergency actions on a pre-contingency basis.

**IV.** **Procedures for Unacceptable Voltage Conditions**

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control
(OP-12) and various voltage guides define criteria and establish guides for
actions to be taken so that desirable levels of voltage are maintained on the
transmission system. The LCCs shall make every effort to correct unacceptable
voltage conditions and shall coordinate actions with ISO.

When unacceptable voltage conditions occur and corrective actions described in
OP-12 and/or the voltage guides are not effective, the ISO System Operators
and/or LCC System Operators shall take Emergency actions, as defined in
OP-19, to correct the situation.

ISO System Operators and LCC System Operators shall keep operations
management at ISO and the LCCs advised as to conditions that might
necessitate review of the need to implement Emergency actions on a precontingency basis.

**V.** **Restoration of Load**

ISO shall issue an Operating Instruction for the restoration of any load shed
pursuant to this OP when system conditions permit.

**DEFINITIONS**

**Peak Load Exposure (PLE):**

Peak Load Exposure (PLE) represents a projection of the New England Reliability
Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) possible weekly peak load,
which has a 50% chance of occurring. The weekly PLEs are derived from ratios
relating the projected weekly peak load to the seasonal peak load. The seasonal
peak loads are projected in the annual ISO New England Capacity, Energy, Loads,
and Transmission (CELT) Report.

The summer PLE period begins with the first full week of June and continues through
the end of the second full week of September. The winter PLE period is three (3)
weeks, starting with the first full week in January, not inclusive of the week with the
New Year’s holiday. PLEs for all other weeks are represented as fractional ratios of
those projected seasonal peaks.

The fractional ratios used to compute weekly PLEs are based on historical peak load
data. The historical weekly peak are first sorted such that week twenty-seven (27) is
the week of July 4th in each of the years. The reconstituted weekly maximum load
for a five (5) week rolling window, centered on the reported week, was then related to
the weather-normalized, seasonal peak load as follows:

   - weeks one (1) through eighteen (18) seasonal winter peak,

   - weeks nineteen (19) through thirty-nine (39) seasonal summer peak,

    - weeks forty (40) through fifty-two (52) succeeding seasonal winter peak.

These weekly to seasonal peaks are represented as fractions. Judgment based on
review of historic weather patterns and seasonal peak occurrence was applied to the
curves.


-----

pp

**Long Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM):**

The Long Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM) is a measure of the New
England RCA/BAA projected weekly capacity margin. A positive value of LTOCM
indicates a potential operable capacity surplus over and above the estimated load
plus Operating Reserve requirement. A negative value indicates that a potential
operable capacity deficiency could occur. The LTOCM and its components are
defined below:

LTOCM = A + B – C – D – E – F – G + H where:

A is the Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) of all Resources including any

expected Resources reactivations and new commercial Resources.

B is the sum of the external import capacity purchases

C is the forecast 50/50 PLE.

D is the Operating Reserve requirement as defined in ISO New England

Operating Procedure No. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation (OP-8).

E is the total of Resource Planned Outages (POs) for the period. This value

would also include any known long-term Forced Outages (FO)s.

F is the allowance for Unplanned Outages as defined within SOP
OUTSCH.0030.0040 - Perform Long Term Resource Outage Coordination.

G is the allowance for gas-at-risk generation as defined within SOP
OUTSCH.0030.0040 - Perform Long Term Resource Outage Coordination.

H is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.

The CSO for all Resources shall be used in accordance with the most recently
published monthly CSO/Nominated Consumption Limit reports and adjusted using
the most recent information for new Resources. The PLE used shall be based upon
the most recently published CELT Report.


-----

pp

**Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM):**

The Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM) is a measure of the projected
weekly operable capacity margin on a sub-area basis. A positive LOCM value
indicates a projected operable capacity surplus available to respond to a second
contingency event within a sub-area. A negative value indicates that a potential
operable capacity deficiency could occur. LOCM analyses are performed in addition
to the full New England RCA/BAA analysis and are based on data included in the
Annual Maintenance Schedules.

LOCM = A – B – C + D – E – F + G where:

A is the CSOs of all Resources that are currently in service.  Resources

reactivations and new Resources that have achieved commercial operation
and are included in the third annual reconfiguration auction shall be
included in the LOCM calculations.

B is the total of POs during the period for all Resources in the sub-area. This

value includes any known long-term FOs.

C is a reliability adjustment reflecting the historical performance of combustion

turbines.

D is the import capability for the sub-area for the week.

E is the forecast load for the sub-area, which is calculated by multiplying the

New England RCA/BAA 50/50 PLE by the sub-area percentage of system
seasonal peak load.

F is the largest single source, which is defined as the largest available

Resources in the sub-area during the period.

G is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.


-----

pp

**Short Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM):**

The Short Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM) is a measure of the New
England RCA/BAA projected capacity margin looking ahead 14 days or less.
STOCM is calculated using the components defined below. A positive value of
STOCM indicates a potential operable capacity surplus over and above the
estimated capacity requirement. A negative value indicates that a potential operable
capacity deficiency could occur.

STOCM = A + B – C – D – E – F + G where:

A is the CSOs of all Resources that are currently in service.

B is the sum of the external Import Capacity Resource purchases.

C is the forecast load. For future days 7-14, the 50/50 PLE is used. For

future days 1-6, the ISO short-term load forecast is used. This forecast is
based on the forecasted weather.

D is the Operating Reserve requirement as defined in OP-8.

E is the total of Resources actually out-of-service for POs or Maintenance

Outages (MOs), or scheduled or known to be out-of-service in the future
period of 14 days or less.

F is a reliability factor to adjust the overall STOCM by considering FOs, gas
at-risk generation, changes in load, etc. The reliability factor shall be the
greater of gas-at-risk generation or 1,500 MW for day 1 through 6 and
2,000 MW for day 7 through 14 of the short-term look-ahead period.

G is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.


-----

pp

**Short Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM):**

The Short Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM) is a measure of the
projected capacity margin looking ahead 14 days or less on a sub-area basis. The
STLOCM is calculated using the components defined below. A positive STLOCM
value indicates a projected operable capacity surplus available to respond to a
second contingency event within a sub-area. A negative value indicates that a
potential operable capacity deficiency could occur.

STLOCM = A – B – C + D – E – F + G where:

A is the CSOs of all Resources in the sub-area that are currently in service.

B is the total of POs during the period for all Resources in the sub-area. This

value includes any known long-term FOs.

C is a reliability adjustment reflecting the historical performance of combustion

turbines.

D is the import capability for the sub-area.

E is the forecast load for the sub-area. For future days 7-14, the 50/50 PLE is

multiplied by the sub-area percentage of the system load. For future days
1-6, the short-term daily peak load (based on forecasted weather) is
multiplied by the sub-area percentage of the system load.

F is the largest single source, which is defined as the largest available

Resources in the sub-area during the period.

G is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This ISO New England (ISO-NE or ISO) Operating Procedure (OP) describes the
actions that ISO performs to develop External Transaction schedules for external
interfaces between Reliability Coordinator Areas/Balancing Authority Areas
(RCAs/BAAs), for physical implementation in the ISO Real-Time Energy Market
(RTM).

External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7.A of the Tariff are
associated with the Coordinated Transaction Scheduling (CTS) Enabled
Interface.[1] External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff
are associated with non-CTS interfaces.[2] ISO develops and administers External
Transaction schedules in accordance with the requirements of the ISO New
England Operating Documents. These provisions include:

     - ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff Section

III, ISO New England Market Rule 1 - Standard Market Design (Market
Rule 1); and

     - Section II.44 of the OATT contains the rules for scheduling and curtailing

External Transactions on both the CTS Enabled Interface and non-CTS
interfaces; and

     - The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)/ISO-NE

Coordination Agreement), which includes the protocols for managing
External Transactions associated with the CTS Enabled Interface;

ISO is prepared to modify schedules or reduce any and all transactions in the event
that available market-based options are insufficient to provide system reliability.

1 The CTS Enabled Interface is the New York Northern AC Tie (NYN) external interface
2 Non-CTS interfaces include the Cross Sound Cable (CSC), Northport to Norwalk Harbor Cable (NNC), Highgate,

Phase I/II HVDC and NE/NB external interfaces.

-----

**II.** **ISO ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO RTM EXTERNAL TRANSACTION SCHEDULING**

**A. External Transaction e-Tag Requirements**

1. All External Transactions submitted to ISO for physical implementation in

the RTM must have an associated e-Tag that complies with the
requirements of the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)
Electronic Tagging Functional Specification. An e-Tag is required for each
External Transaction to be implemented for which ISO is on the
scheduling path as the Sink, Source, or intermediate Balancing Authority
(BA).

2. ISO reviews and actively approves, or denies, an e-Tag based solely on

the information provided in the e-Tag within the review time specified by
the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability
Standards INT-006 - Evaluation of Interchange Transactions.

3. An e-Tag denial notification is automatically created when the e-Tag is

denied and includes the reason for the denial

4. Prior to the start time indicated in the e-Tag, each e-Tag shall be

associated with an External Transaction submitted under Section III.1.10.7
of the Tariff or the e-Tag will be terminated by ISO.

5. Before implementing any External Transaction, whether for an import,

export, or wheel-through, ISO verifies that a complete, approved e-Tag
exists for that External Transaction and that the energy profile on the eTag and the External Transaction are consistent.

6. If, due to software issues, any variation exists between the e-Tag and the

External Transaction, ISO Settlement staff shall utilize the External
Transaction scheduled MW.

**B. Verification of External Transactions on Non-CTS Interfaces**

1. ISO validates each External Transaction submitted under Section

III.1.10.7 of the Tariff in order of submission through a combination of
automated software checks and manual review.

2. Transmission Service Considerations

a. ISO verifies that appropriate and adequate advance transmission

service arrangements have been obtained from Transmission
Providers (TP(s)) within the New England RCA/BAA. Where possible,
verification is made through the Open Access Same-Time Information
System (OASIS). If transmission service arrangements cannot be
verified via the OASIS:

i. ISO may use other means at its disposal to attempt to verify the

existence of proper transmission service arrangements.

ii. ISO may ask the entity submitting the External Transaction to state

in writing that proper transmission service arrangements are in
place or to provide a copy of the transmission service agreement
with the TP.

H d C I U ll d


-----

b. If an External Transaction is implemented by ISO and the transmission

service arrangements are not adequate with any TP in the contract
path the transmission customer may be subject to unauthorized use
charges under the TP’s tariff from which adequate transmission service
was not procured.

3. ISO verifies that a valid e-Tag has been referenced and contains an

energy profile (MW over time) that is the same as or greater than the
External Transaction.

4. ISO verifies that any optional flags selected on the External Transaction

were referenced appropriately.

5. ISO notifies the transaction submitter via the External Transaction

scheduling software if an External Transaction has been rejected and the
reason that it was rejected.

6. Each modification of an External Transaction is validated by the External

Transaction scheduling software and the ISO. The transaction timestamp
is updated to reflect the time when the modification was submitted. ISO
notifies the transaction submitter via the External Transaction scheduling
software if a modification has been rejected and the reason why it was
rejected.

7. ISO does not review any External Transaction request that is submitted to

ISO outside of the submission and modification deadlines established in
Section III of the Tariff.

**C. Verification of External Transactions on CTS Enabled Interface**

1. ISO does not directly review any External Transaction request that is

submitted to the NYISO Joint Energy Scheduling System (JESS) prior to
consideration in the NYISO Real-Time Commitment (RTC).

2. The e-Tag that is referenced on the NYISO JESS External Transaction is

reviewed by ISO in accordance with Section II.A of this OP. Denial of the
e-Tag or adjustment of the e-Tag MW by ISO will impact the consideration
of the External Transaction in the NYISO RTC.

**D. Day-Before Checkout**

1. ISO performs a day prior check-out of External Transactions with each

neighboring BA as part of the process to develop a preliminary
interchange for each external interface. The check-out compares the
e-Tag ID and MW values of the External Transaction. No External
Transaction is rejected because it does not checkout on the day prior with
the neighboring BA.

**III.** **GENERAL SCHEDULING OF EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS**

**A. Scheduling of RTM External Transactions on Non-CTS** **Interfaces**

1. Only External Transactions verified by ISO are eligible for physical

implementation in the RTM.

2. Each scheduling interval for an External Transaction is one hour,

beginning at the start of the clock hour and ending at the end of the clock
hour, except where shorter intervals are allowed under the operating
protocols of ISO and the applicable external BA .

Non-CTS Interface PNode Scheduling Interval

.I.HQ_P1_P2345 5 hourly

.I.HQHIGATE120 2 hourly

.I.SHOREHAM138 99 hourly

.I.NRTHPORT138 5 hourly

.I.SALBRYNB345 1 hourly

3. ISO schedules each External Transaction (import, export and wheel
through transaction) in whole MW at the New England BAA boundary.

4. ISO schedules each transaction and physically implements flow across

each external interface for each scheduling interval of the Operating Day.
Each import, export and wheel-through transaction is considered for each
scheduling interval, based on the applicable Locational Marginal Price
(LMP), on a net basis up to the applicable transfer limit determined for each
interface by ISO.

5. In the event all economic External Transactions cannot be scheduled over

an external interface, the scheduling rules for non-CTS interfaces in Section
II.44.1 of the OATT are applied.

6. The Real-Time Energy Market timestamp of a transaction, as identified in

Section II.44.1 of the OATT and Appendix B of this OP, shall be used as the
tiebreaker where the most recent submittals are reduced first. The
timestamp is considered at a granularity of one minute. For example, all
transactions submitted between 05:02:00 and 05:02:59 would have a
timestamp of 05:02. In the event of a tie in the timestamp, reductions will be
applied pro-rata based on submitted MW.

7. To the best of its ability, ISO reflects the impact of the economic loading of

the external interface for the next scheduling interval upon the projected
External Node LMP. If ISO expects that the scheduling of priced
transactions may modify the projected LMP to the extent that those
transactions are no longer economic, those transactions may be
scheduled in part or may not be scheduled.

H d C I U ll d

|Non-CTS Interface PNode|Scheduling Interval|
|---|---|
|.I.HQ_P1_P2345 5|hourly|
|.I.HQHIGATE120 2|hourly|
|.I.SHOREHAM138 99|hourly|
|.I.NRTHPORT138 5|hourly|
|.I.SALBRYNB345 1|hourly|


-----

8. ISO only allows the scheduling of Market Participant (MP) Emergency

Energy transactions (EETs) and out-of-merit imports in order to maintain the
Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement, unless unusual or unexpected reliability
needs or system conditions dictate a more conservative approach. An
example of such a condition is if Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve (TMOR)
would be depleted for more than four (4) hours.

**B. Scheduling of External Transactions on the CTS Enabled interface**

1. The CTS Enabled Interface is ordinarily scheduled every 15 minutes.

CTS Enabled

Scheduling Interval
Interface PNode

.I.ROSETON 345 1 15 minutes

2. When necessary to ensure or preserve system reliability, or when not able

to implement schedules as expected due to software or communication
issues, ISO and NYISO shall coordinate and determine when to temporarily
employ hourly scheduling on the CTS Enabled Interface in accordance with
the ISO-NE/NYISO Coordination Agreement.

3. ISO schedules each External Transaction (import, export and wheel-through

transaction) in whole MW at the New England BAA boundary.

**C. Sales of Energy Backed by Installed Capacity to External BAAs**

1. Non-CTS interfaces: ISO shall review the status of generators referenced in

External Transactions with the flag of Non-Capacity Supply Obligation
(CSO) Export under either of the following conditions:

a. Whenever exports are being reduced to address Operating Reserve

conditions to determine if the requirements of Section III.1.10.7 (i) of
the Tariff are satisfied; or

b. Whenever scheduling on an associated external interface is

constrained to determine if the referenced generator is Self-Scheduled
in the RTM and online at a MW level greater than or equal to the
External Transaction sale’s MW amount.

2. CTS Enabled Interface: ISO shall respond to requests from NYISO to

deliver capacity in Real-Time. Upon such a request, ISO shall review the
status of the generators with capacity obligations to NYISO to determine if
the energy from those generators is available and deliverable.

**D. Purchases of External Installed Capacity**

1. Non-CTS interfaces: External Transactions with the flag of Import Capacity

Resource will be verified by ISO for expected delivery with neighboring BA.

**2.** CTS Enabled Interface: ISO may request capacity associated with Import

Capacity Resources located in NYISO as described in Schedule D of the
NYISO/ ISO-NE Coordination Agreement. ISO shall not request capacity
from NYISO unless forecasts indicate that a net import is needed on the
CTS Enabled Interface to maintain the Operating Reserve requirements.

H d C I U ll d

|CTS Enabled Interface PNode|Scheduling Interval|
|---|---|
|.I.ROSETON 345 1|15 minutes|


-----

**E. Check Out with Neighboring BAs**

1. ISO performs a check out of External Transactions submitted to the RTM

that are being considered for physical implementation for the next
scheduling interval with each neighboring BA.

2. If an External Transaction submitted to ISO for consideration for RTM

implementation does not check out with the neighboring BA for a given
scheduling interval, ISO does not schedule the transaction for the
associated scheduling interval.

3. If ISO cannot access the current Real-Time External Transaction data to

perform the electronic checkout process, ISO will utilize the data from daybefore checkout process as the Real-Time External Transaction data.

**F. Use of Optional Flags in Real-Time Processes**

The table below contains the optional flags that may be associated with an
External Transaction submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff and
describes what, if any, impact each flag has on the RT External Transaction
scheduling process.

H d C I U ll d


-----

|Optional Flags|Impact of Flag on Real-Time Processes|
|---|---|
|Excepted Transaction|The priority defined in Section II.44.1.a of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|
|Grandfathered|The priority defined in Section II.44.1.a of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|
|Import Resource|This indicates to ISO which transactions to verify for Real- Time capacity delivery with a neighboring area|
|Non-CSO Export|The status of referenced ISO-NE generator reviewed if: a. the interface is constrained, and b. exports are being reduced to address reserve capacity conditions|
|Local Second Contingency Commitment (LSCC) Export|If transaction meets criteria defined in Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff, the priority defined in Section II.44 of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|
|Unconstrained Export|If transaction meets criteria defined in Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff, the priority defined in Section II.44 of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|
|EET Emergency|ISO shall only schedule when in appropriate actions of OP-4|
|New Brunswick Security Energy Transactions|ISO shall only schedule to preserve minimum flows from New Brunswick [See Section IV and V.D]|
|Generation Information System|No impact|

**IV.** **REAL-TIME SCHEDULING RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**

This section addresses reliability considerations utilized during the RTM External
Transaction scheduling process. These considerations include: a restriction on a
specific external interface for reliability, excessive change in system-wide net
interchange, approaching or reaching minimum generation conditions, and/or
approaching or reaching a deficiency in Operating Reserve. If an External
Transaction must be reduced due to any reliability condition, an appropriate
description shall be included on the electronic notification of the scheduled MW
amount.

**A. Ramp Constraints**

Implementation of a large External Transaction or implementation of a number
of External Transactions at the same time may cause a large change in the
scheduled power flow on the ISO external ties from one scheduling interval to
the next. Such power swings on the external interfaces may create or worsen
reliability concerns. Consequently, limitations may be placed on the allowed
magnitude of the change (i.e., ramping limitation) in scheduled External
Transactions from one scheduling interval to the next scheduling interval. The
process by which transactions are impacted by ramp constraints is defined in
Appendix B of this OP.

On the CTS Enabled Interface, the default values, as defined in the ISONE/NYISO Coordination Agreement, are posted on the NYISO website and
enforced by the NYISO RTC solution.

**B. Minimum Generation Conditions**

When scheduling External Transactions for the next scheduling interval, prior
to declaring a Minimum Generation Emergency, ISO shall, in the order listed
below if possible, restrict the scheduling of Real-Time Energy Market External
Transactions purchases in order to maintain sufficient backdown margin on
Resources:

1. On the CTS-Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of purchases

submitted under Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff such that the resulting net
interchange schedule is not an import but is a value between the net of the
External Transactions that cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market and
subsequently satisfied the day-before checkout process for that
scheduling interval and zero, and then,

2. On the non CTS-Enabled interfaces, restrict the scheduling of purchases

submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that have not cleared the
Day-Ahead Energy Market for that scheduling interval.

If the ISO declares a Minimum Generation Emergency pursuant to Section
III.2.5(c) of the Tariff, the following steps will be taken to maintain system
reliability:

H d C I U ll d


-----

1. On the CTS Enabled interface ISO shall restrict the scheduling of all

remaining Real-Time Energy Market External Transaction purchases
submitted under Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff.

2. Based on price, dispatchable Generator Assets shall be subject to

Dispatch Instructions from the ISO to reduce generation down to
Emergency Minimum Limits and all External Transaction purchases
submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that cleared in the DayAhead Energy Market shall be subject to reduction. Such reductions of
dispatchable Generator Assets and External Transactions submitted
under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff will be applied on a 50/50 basis until
supply and demand are matched or the capability of either dispatchable
Generator Assets or External Transactions submitted under Section
III.1.10.7 of the Tariff to reduce is exhausted. Required reductions will
then be taken on the remaining dispatchable Generator Assets or External
Transaction purchases submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff as
needed.

3. If the actions above are not sufficient to match supply to demand, ISO

shall utilize all available information, including but not limited to Minimum
Run Times or Minimum Down Times and expected capacity conditions for
the next Operating Day, recognizing the Pool-Scheduled Resource vs.
Self-Scheduled Resource priority, in issuing de-commitment orders.

Purchases will be reduced until the export TTC is reached. The process for
reducing External Transaction purchases submitted under Section III.1.10.7
of the Tariff is described in Appendix B to this OP-9.

**C. Operating Reserve Conditions**

When scheduling External Transactions for the next scheduling interval, prior
to implementing actions of OP-4, ISO shall, in the order listed below if
possible, restrict the scheduling of Real-Time Energy Market External
Transactions in order to continue to meet load and Operating Reserve
requirements:

1. On the CTS-Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of exports submitted

under Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff such that the resulting net
interchange schedule is not a net export but is a value between zero and
the net of the External Transactions that cleared the Day-Ahead Energy
Market and subsequently satisfied the day-before checkout process for
that scheduling interval, and then

2. On the non CTS-Enabled interfaces, restrict the scheduling of exports

submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that have not cleared the
Day-Ahead Energy Market for that scheduling interval. After all such
transactions have been restricted, out-of-merit import transactions will be
scheduled to the extent that they are available and can be reliably
scheduled.

H d C I U ll d


-----

3. If Phase II is the largest contingency, ISO-NE may reduce the net import

on Phase II to the net interchange from the day-before checkout process,
in accordance with Section III.1.10.7(c) of the Tariff.

Following the implementation of OP-4, the steps below will be taken in the
order listed, to the extent required to meet the Ten-Minute Reserve
Requirement:

1. On the CTS Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of remaining Real
Time Energy Market External Transaction exports submitted under
Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff.

2. On the non-CTS interfaces, schedule MP EETs

3. On the non-CTS interfaces, restrict Real-Time Energy Market External

Transaction exports submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that
have cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market.

Exports will be reduced until the import TTC is reached. To the extent
restrictions in scheduling External Transactions are required as set forth
above, the process for reducing all Real-Time Energy Market External
Transaction exports submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff is
described in Appendix B to this OP-9.

**D. Specific Constrained Interface**

Restrictions placed on a specific external interface may be the result of
conditions directly impacting that interface, conditions internal to ISO, or
conditions external to ISO. ISO accepts and applies transmission restrictions
imposed by a TP or Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA)
external to the New England RCA/BAA. Such restrictions shall be
communicated to ISO Operations by the appropriate dispatch organization.

1. Such restrictions may result in:

a. Reduction in the net schedule of transactions on the interface; or

b. Reduction in transactions in one direction to maximize flow in the

other direction

2. External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff will be

scheduled to the restriction in accordance with the rules defined in Section
II.44.1 of the Tariff.

3. External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7.A of the Tariff will

be scheduled to the restriction in accordance with the rules defined in
Section II.44.2 of the OATT.

**E. NBSO to ISO-NE Security Energy Transactions**

This section addresses provisions for ISO to preserve minimum flows on the
Keene Rd-Keswick (3001) tie line and Orrington- Point Lepreau (390/3016) tie
line in accordance with the applicable ISO / New Brunswick Power System
Operator (NBP-SO) transmission operating guide.

The New England RCA/BAA and New Brunswick RCA/BAA both share a joint
Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) related to minimum flow

H d C I U ll d


-----

requirements on the New Brunswick - New England transmission interface. At
infrequent intervals, the flow on the interface is insufficient from north to south
to provide acceptable steady-state and transient performance of the Maine
system and reliable performance of the 3001 and the 390/3016 lines on a postcontingency basis. ISO takes the lead role in determining the requirements and
coordinating operations between the RCAs/BAAs to avoid violations or correct
exceedances. In order to avoid a violation or correct an exceedance, both
parties take corrective action(s) using no-cost methods first. However, if after
exhausting such no-cost methods, an exceedance or potential violation still
exists, ISO takes the following actions, as necessary and in the following order,
in coordination with MPs and the NBP-SO to avoid a violation or correct an
exceedance of the minimum flow requirement:

1. Reduce exports from New England to New Brunswick

2. Schedule External Transactions, including MP submitted Security Energy

Transactions (SETs) for the next scheduling interval to the required MW
level, based on economics, from all available offers in sufficient quantity to
correct the potential or actual violation.

3. Schedule Control Area to Control Area SETs to satisfy the minimum flow

requirement

**F. Local Area Capacity Deficient Conditions**

When a local area capacity deficient condition within the ISO RCA occurs or is
projected and restricting External Transaction exports will prevent or improve
the condition, then reductions shall be implemented, to the extent required, in
accordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.

H d C I U ll d


-----

**V.** **CURTAILMENT OF EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS**

ISO is prepared to curtail any External Transactions that have been implemented
for physical flow across an external interface if necessary to maintain system
reliability. There are different circumstances under which transactions may be
curtailed, depending on the effect on the power system, and on the particular
external interface involved. All curtailments are determined in a nondiscriminatory manner and an appropriate reason is indicated in the electronic
notification of the curtailment.

**A. Minimum Generation Conditions**

If Minimum Generation conditions arise that must be addressed within a
scheduling interval, the process described in Section IV of this OP shall be
applied to determine the MW amount of External Transactions that shall be
curtailed. Any required curtailment of External Transactions shall be
implemented in accordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.

**B. Operating Reserve Conditions**

If a deficiency in Operating Reserves occurs or is forecast to occur within a
scheduling interval, the process described in Section IV of this OP shall be
applied to determine which External Transactions shall be curtailed. Any
required curtailment of External Transactions shall be implemented in
accordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.

**C. Specific Constrained Interface**

If a condition occurs that creates a restriction on an external interface within a
scheduling interval, ISO shall:

1. Curtail External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the

Tariff in accordance with Sections II.44.1.b and II.44.1.d of the OATT.

2. Curtail External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7.A of the

Tariff in accordance with Section II.44.2 of the OATT.

**D. Security Energy Transactions**

If action is necessary within a scheduling interval to preserve minimum flows
from New Brunswick in accordance with the applicable ISO/NBP-SO
transmission operating guide, the following steps will be taken in coordination
with NBP-SO:

1. Curtail exports from New England to New Brunswick, in accordance with

Appendix B to this OP-9

2. Schedule Control Area-to-Control Area SET to satisfy the minimum

flow requirement

**E. Local Area Capacity Deficient Conditions**

When a local area capacity deficient condition must be mitigated during the
scheduling interval and curtailing External Transaction exports will improve or
relieve the condition, then curtailments shall be implemented, to the extent
required, in accordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.

H d C I U ll d


-----

**VI.** **NOTIFICATIONS**

A. During the Operating Day, the ISO will issue Minimum Generation warnings,

as needed, if the ISO projects the difference between: the sum of projected
load consumption; and the sum of the expected net schedule of all External
Transactions and all on-line generating Resources Economic Minimum Limits;
to be equal to or less than the threshold MW amount set forth in the ISO New
England Control Room Operating Procedures.

B. If export External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7 or Section

III.1.10.7A of the Tariff must be restricted for the next scheduling interval in
order to continue to meet load and Operating Reserve requirements, the ISO
will issue a notice on the ISO external web site that such transactions must be
restricted.

C. ISO posts a notice to the ISO external website requesting the submittal of

EETs for specified hour(s) and amount(s) when reserve capacity deficiency
conditions are projected in a timeframe that will allow MP submittal of such
transactions.

D. ISO posts a notice to the ISO external website requesting the submittal of

SETs for specified hour(s) and amount(s) when the situation identified in
Section IV.E above is projected in a timeframe that will allow MP submittal of
such transactions.

E. Details with respect to the use of transmission service on the Pool

Transmission Facilities (PTF), Other Transmission Facilities (OTF), and
Merchant Transmission Facilities (MTF) ties by each External Transaction
that was implemented in the RTM is posted on the OASIS within seven
calendar days of the Operating Day.

### I. WHEN SHEDDING LOAD NEW ENGLAND WIDE:

**A. Communication With Local Control Centers (LCCs)**

An ISO System Operator[1] (ISO) shall use the “ALL LCCs” telephone function when
issuing Operating Instructions[2] to all LCCs.

**B. Quantity of Load**

ISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction with the quantity of load to be shed or
restored by specifying a percent of area load.

Percent = Total MW Load to be Shed or Restored x 100

Instantaneous New England Load

The identified Percent should be rounded up to the next whole number to determine the
value used in the load shed Operating Instruction.

The identified Percent should be rounded down to the next whole number to determine
the value used in the load restoration Operating Instruction.

**C. Implementation Messages**

ISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction and shall await LCC repeat back, which
should be received from each LCC in alphabetical order. ISO shall acknowledge each
LCC repeat back of the Operating Instruction as correct or reissue the Operating
Instruction.

Typical messages are as follows:

Operating Instruction by ISO:

1. ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually shed X percent of area load.”

or
2. ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually restore X percent of area load.”

Acknowledgments by each LCC:

1. Each LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually shed X percent of area load.”

or
2. Each LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually restore X percent of area load.”

Acknowledgment by ISO:

1. ISO to each LCC: “That is correct.”

(If a misunderstanding occurs, ISO shall reissue the Operating Instruction.)

Appendix A - Estimates Of Additional Generation And Load Relief From System

Wide Implementation Of Actions In ISO New England Operating
Procedure No. 4 - Action During A Capacity Deficiency Based On A
25,000 MW System Load


-----

**PART I - INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes criteria and guidelines for actions during
capacity deficiencies, as directed by ISO New England (ISO) and as implemented by
ISO and the Local Control Centers (LCCs). This OP may be implemented any time one
or more of the following events, or other similar events, occur or are expected to occur:

  - The Resources available to the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/

Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) outside of OP-4 are insufficient to meet the
anticipated load plus Operating Reserve requirements. This OP will not be
implemented to maintain Replacement Reserve requirements.

  - One or more contingencies have occurred resulting in an immediate deficiency in

the New England RCA/BAA available capacity Resources required to meet the
load plus Operating Reserve requirements.

  - Transmission facilities into a sub-area of the New England RCA/BAA are loaded

beyond established transfer capabilities.

  - A sub-area of the New England RCA/BAA is experiencing abnormal voltage

and/or reactive conditions.

  - The need to implement manual load shedding as required by ISO New England

Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7) is imminent but load
shedding may be avoided, or reduced in magnitude, by implementation of this
OP.

  - Another Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) RCA/BAA, or a

remote system or pool, is experiencing a capacity deficiency and has requested
assistance from ISO, which, if provided, would reduce the New England
RCA/BAA actual Operating Reserve below the required levels.

  - Any other serious threat to the integrity of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for

which ISO determines that this OP would mitigate the impact.

Appendix A - Estimates Of Additional Generation And Load Relief From System Wide
Implementation Of Actions In ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action
During A Capacity Deficiency Based On A 25,000 MW System Load contains an
estimate of the additional generation and load relief, which may be achieved through
implementation of the Actions specified in this OP.


-----

**PART II - PROCEDURE**

**I.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **BY** **ISO** **NEW** **ENGLAND**

ISO shall alert each LCC and Market Participant (MP) promptly any time one or
more of the events described in Part I of this OP are anticipated, or have actually
occurred, and implementation of this procedure may be required. ISO shall also
alert each surrounding Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA) and
coordinate with these RCs/BAs in accordance with NPCC Directory #5 Reserve.
The alert shall be issued in accordance with Master/Local Control Center
Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert (M/LCC 2). Upon implementation of
OP-4, ISO shall notify each LCC of the OP-4 Actions required by number. ISO and
each LCC shall initiate Actions according to the authority and responsibility
assigned in this OP. To the extent possible, ISO will continue to dispatch
Resources in accordance with Section III of the ISO New England Inc.
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (Tariff), while ensuring reliability in the
New England RCA/BAA during implementation of OP-4.

Actions of OP-4 shall be implemented to the extent required to manage Operating
Reserve Requirements, in accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure
No. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation (OP-8) and/or to provide necessary
dispatch options during abnormal conditions.

**ACTION 1 (An ISO responsibility)**

ISO shall notify all Resources that a capacity deficiency exists. Each Resource
with a Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) shall prepare to provide all associated
operable capability.

ISO shall notify via the “Notices” section of the ISO external website that each
Settlement Only Resource with Real-Time obligations and a CSO should be
monitoring the status of the reserve pricing and is required to meet its obligation
under the “Capacity Scarcity Condition” definitions in Section III of the Tariff.

Begin to allow the depletion of Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve.

Implement a Power Caution.

**ACTION 2 (An ISO responsibility)**

Declare Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 1.[1]

**ACTION 3 (ISO responsible for Designated Entities and Demand**
**Designated Entities, LCCs for office complexes.)**

Request voluntary load curtailment of MP facilities in the New England
RCA/BAA.

1 EEA Levels are described in Attachment 1 to NERC Reliability Standard EOP-011 - Emergency Preparedness and
Operations.


-----

**ACTION 4 (An ISO responsibility)**

Implement a Power Watch.

ISO will normally implement Action 5 and beyond of this OP to maintain TenMinute Reserve.

**ACTION 5 (An ISO responsibility)**

Arrange to purchase available emergency capacity and energy, or energy only,
(if capacity backing is not available) from MPs or neighboring RCAs/BAAs.
Control Area-to-Control Area emergency transactions will normally be used as a
last resort, when market-based Emergency Energy transactions are not
available, or not available in a timely fashion.

Action 6 shall be implemented to the extent required to maintain Ten-Minute
Reserve, in accordance with OP-8, and to enable ISO to better cope with possible
continuing and deteriorating abnormal operating conditions.

**ACTION 6 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**

Implement a voltage reduction of five percent (5%) of normal operating voltage
requiring more than 10 minutes to implement.

Declare Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 2.

In addition, ISO shall begin to count the manual load shedding capability
available as part of OP-7 to meet its Disturbance Control Standard
requirements.

**ACTION** **7 (ISO responsibility)**

**NOTE**

The following request will be made on a forecast basis when ISO anticipates it will be
unable to maintain Ten-Minute Reserve or in Real-Time based on the current
operating conditions

Request Generators and Demand Response Resources (DRRs) not subject to
a CSO to voluntarily provide energy for reliability purposes.

Action 8 shall be implemented to maintain adequate Ten-Minute Reserve in the
New England RCA/BAA. The amount to be maintained will be determined based
on actual system conditions at the time of the deficiency or the need to aid another
NPCC RCA/BAA in accordance with NPCC Directory #5 Reserve.

**ACTION 8 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**

Implement a voltage reduction of five percent (5%) of normal operating voltage
that is attainable within 10 minutes.

Declare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.


-----

Actions 9, 10 and 11 will normally be implemented by ISO through the LCCs based
upon advance projections made by ISO that it will not be possible to maintain
adequate Ten-Minute Reserve by implementing Actions 1 through 8. When
Actions 9 and 10 are requested, the particular hours that they are to be
implemented will be specified by ISO. Actions 9, 10, and 11 should be
implemented as early as possible to achieve maximum benefit.

**ACTION 9 (LCC responsibility)**

Request all of the customer generation not contractually available to MPs.
Request voluntary load curtailment by large industrial and commercial
customers.

**ACTION 10 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**

Initiate radio and television appeals for voluntary load curtailment.

Implement a Power Warning.

Declare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.

Depending on the circumstances and the time required to institute certain of the
above Actions, it may be necessary to call for some Actions simultaneously, or
to alter the order of Action initiations. When all of the above Actions have been
taken, further action, if required, is covered under OP-7

It may be necessary to implement OP-7, prior to the implementation of all of the
above Actions. If, at any time during implementation of the above Actions, it
appears that implementation of OP-7 will be required; ISO shall notify each
LCC.

When Action 11 is requested, the particular hours this Action is to be implemented
will be specified by the ISO.

**ACTION 11 (An ISO responsibility)**

Request each New England state Governor to reinforce Power Warning
appeals, as initiated in Action 10.

Declare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.


-----

**II.** **CANCELLATION** **OF** **ACTIONS**

When the system conditions have sufficiently improved, ISO shall cancel the
Actions instituted in this OP Section I. Depending on system conditions, the order
of Action cancellation may be different than the order of Action initiation.

**III.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **BY** **LCCS**

Any of the Actions provided in this OP may be implemented by an LCC to deal with
local conditions within that LCC’s territory. The severity of the condition will
determine the Actions taken. ISO shall review LCC implementation of this OP to
verify that the implementation is consistent with Section III of the Tariff and ISO
Manuals.

**IV.** **COMMUNICATIONS**

ISO shall inform all LCCs simultaneously of system conditions and issue an
implementation Operating Instruction. Each LCC, in alphabetical order, shall
repeat the Operating Instruction back to ISO, to provide acknowledgment. When
each LCC completes implementation of an Action, the LCC shall report
implementation of the Action has been completed and the time that Action was
completed, to ISO. These communications will be performed per the
communications protocol required by NERC Reliability Standard COM-002 and as
stated in M/LCC No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices.

Each LCC shall be responsible for keeping its member companies and ISO
informed of all situations pertaining to implementation and cancellation of the
Actions of this OP. ISO shall make notifications to the Department of Energy as
required. Each LCC shall make notifications to state regulatory agencies as
required. ISO shall issue a report to the appropriate New England Power Pool
(NEPOOL) Technical Committee(s) following implementation of this OP, within 3
Business Days of the implementation.

**V.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **OF** **AN** **ALERT**

ISO Control Room staff shall notify, as appropriate, each LCC, Designated Entity
(DE), and Demand Designated Entity (DDE) as soon as OP-4 conditions are
anticipated or underway by executing its responsibilities as declared by M/LCC 2.


-----

**VI.** **PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS**

Notifications associated with forecast or actual implementation of OP-4 shall be
conducted in accordance with CROP.10002 Implement Capacity Remedial Actions.
Power Advisories shall be issued by ISO via its external website. These Power
Advisories shall be triggered by the implementation of certain Actions of OP-4 as
described below. These notifications are considered public information.

Power Caution

A Power Caution is triggered by the initial implementation of OP-4 Action 1. A
Power Caution is defined as a notification that electric reserves can no longer
be maintained using normal measures. Although full reserves are not being
maintained, utility personnel will begin to take steps to manage these reserves.

Power Watch

A Power Watch is triggered by the implementation of OP-4 Action 4. A Power
Watch is defined as a notification that further steps to manage capacity could
affect the public.

Power Warning

A Power Warning is triggered by the implementation of OP-4 Action 10. A
Power Warning is defined as a notification for public appeals when an
immediate reduction in power usage is necessary to avert overload of the
electrical system. Public appeals are made when other efforts (e.g., emergency
purchases, voluntary curtailment, contracted curtailment and voltage reduction)
have been unsuccessful in bringing supply and demand back into balance.

 surrounding the appeals, including timing and the amount of advance notice that can be given.

 (3) The MW values are based on a 25,000 MW system load and verified
 by the most recent voltage reduction test.

 (4) EEA Levels are described in Attachment 1 to NERC Reliability
 Standard EOP-011 - Emergency Operations

**I. INTRODUCTION**

This Operating Procedure (OP) establishes the process for a Market Participant (MP) to
request a Planned Outage (PO), Maintenance Outage (MO), or Overrun Planned Outage
(OPO) for a generator, Demand Response Resource (DRR), Dispatchable Asset Related
Demand (DARD), or Alternative Technology Regulation Resource (ATRR). This OP also
establishes the process for ISO New England (ISO) and the relevant Local Control Center
(LCC) to evaluate PO and MO requests, and for ISO to approve or deny such requests.

This OP is designed to facilitate the scheduling of POs and MOs/OPOs for an MP’s
generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR and to allow:

(1) each MP to incorporate future maintenance in its budget forecasts;

(2) sufficient time for an MP to respond to market signals; and

(3) sufficient time for ISO and the relevant LCC to assess the impact of each generator,
DRR, DARD, or ATRR outage request on the reliability of the New England Reliability
Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA)[1] and the New England
Transmission System.

Each MP shall, to the fullest extent practicable, maintain and operate all generators,
DRRs, DARDs, or ATRRs that it owns or controls in accordance with Good Utility Practice.
An MP shall not take a generator, DRR, DARD, ATRR, or Qualified Generator Reactive
Resource out-of-service for maintenance without ISO approval, unless there is a danger to
personnel or a risk of equipment damage (except for generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR
outages where a Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) is not impacted or where there is no
CSO). If a generator, DRR, DARD or ATRR is forced out-of-service due to personnel or
equipment risk, the ISO Control Room Generation Operator and Forecaster shall be
notified as soon as possible. ISO shall categorize an outage not approved by ISO as a
Forced Outage (FO). An MP shall request a PO, MO, or OPO with as much advance
notice as possible in order to prevent an FO.

**A. PO, MO, and OPO Requests**

An MP shall submit a request for a PO, MO, or OPO when:

     - the PO, MO, or OPO of the Resource impacts the CSO of the associated

capacity Resource;

     - the request is associated with a Resource without a CSO that is a qualified

Reactive Resource;

     - the PO, MO, or OPO of the DRR is for 5 MW or more and results in the

associated Active Demand Capacity Resource (ADCR) falling short of its CSO by
5 MW or more (the DRR is the unit that is dispatched in the energy market, but
the ADCR has the CSO); or

1  Reliability Coordinator Area and Balancing Authority Area are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC

Reliability Standards.


-----

   - a PO, MO, or OPO would reduce the ability of a DARD to interrupt without

reducing its load by a corresponding amount.

The requirements for PO requests are detailed in Section III.B of this OP. The
requirements for MO and OPO requests are detailed in Section III.C of this OP.

**B. DRR**

An MP shall submit an outage request for a DRR in accordance with this OP if the
DRR’s offered maximum reduction will be reduced by 5 MW or more, the DRR is
associated with an ADCR, and the impact of the DRR’s reduced availability will result
in the associated ADCR falling short of its CSO by 5 MW or more. When there is more
than one DRR associated with an ADCR, the impact from the reduced availability of a
DRR on the ADCR’s CSO is determined by summing the offered maximum reductions
of all of the DRRs that are associated with that ADCR. If the sum of the offered
maximum reductions of all the DRRs associated with the ADCR will fall short of the
CSO by 5 MW or more, and if a single DRR’s maximum reduction will be reduced by 5
MW or more, the MP shall be required to report the outage to ISO. (The maximum
reduction to be used shall be for the expected peak hour of the Operating Day.)

**C. DARD**

An MP shall not reduce the ability for a DARD to interrupt to its Nominated
Consumption Limit (NCL) without ISO approval unless there is a danger to personnel
or a risk of equipment damage. An MP that reduces the ability for a DARD to interrupt
due to danger to personnel or a risk of equipment damage shall notify the ISO Control
Room Generation Operator and Forecaster of the reduction as soon as practicable.

**D. ATRR**

When a PO, MO, or OPO would reduce the ability of an ATRR that is modeled in the
ISO topology to provide the registered Regulation capability for more than 24
continuous hours, the MP shall submit a request for the PO, MO, or OPO.

**E. Intermittent Power Resources**

The process for submitting and evaluating PO, MO, and OPO requests for Intermittent
Power Resources shall be the same as for Resources.

**F. Relay Protection Systems**

An MP shall submit a request for any planned or unplanned testing or maintenance
outage of a relay protection system that could reduce or impact the normal operation
of the New England RCA/BAA or the New England Transmission System in
accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 24 - Protection Outages,
Settings and Coordination (OP-24). The scheduling requirements are designed to
allow sufficient time for ISO and each relevant LCC to assess the impact on reliability
of each protection outage request.

**G. Notification of PO or MO When CSO is Not Impacted/There is No CSO**


-----

An MP shall notify ISO of each generator PO or MO that does not impact the CSO of
the associated capacity Resource or that is associated with a Resource that does not
have a CSO.

The MP shall categorize and report each Resource outage to ISO in accordance with
the NERC Generating Availability Data System (GADS) - Data Reporting Instructions
and this OP.

**H. ISO Coordination of POs and MOs/OPOs**

Whenever possible, ISO shall coordinate any transmission, generator, DRR and
DARD POs, MOs and OPOs to reduce Congestion Costs. For an importing area, ISO
shall evaluate requested POs, MOs, and OPOs for any economic generator, DRR or
DARD within the area simultaneously with transmission facilities that significantly
support area import capability. For an exporting area, ISO shall coordinate any
generator, DRR, and DARD outage within the area coincident with outages of
transmission facilities that significantly support area export capabilities.

**I.** **Import Capacity Resources**

The MP shall notify the ISO if there is a reduction in capability that impacts the CSO of
an Import Capacity Resource backed by one or more Resources.


-----

**II. DEFINITIONS**

**Annual Maintenance Schedule (AMS) is a capacity assessment report provided and**

updated by the ISO Long Term Outage Coordination group on a daily basis. This
capacity assessment is intended to convey forecasted capacity margins in order to
coordinate Resource and transmission outages in a reliable manner. Providing this
report with two years of forecast capacity margins affords sufficient lead-time to
schedule Planned Outages (POs) for the current and future Capacity Commitment
Periods (CCPs).

**Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM) is a measure of the long-term projected**

weekly operable capacity margin on a New England sub-area basis, as described in
OP-5 Appendix A – Operable Capacity Calculations (OP-5A). The sub-area analysis is
forecast for up to nineteen (19) months and is performed in addition to the operable
capacity margin analysis for the entire New England RCA/BAA.

**Long-Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM) is a measure of New England**

RCA/BAA projected weekly operable capacity margin looking ahead up to twenty-four
(24) months based on the assumptions in OP-5A. A positive value of LTOCM
indicates a potential surplus of operable capacity over and above the estimated load
plus Operating Reserve requirement. The LTOCM formula and its components are
defined in OP-5A.

**Operable Capacity Margin (OCM) is, collectively, the Long Term Operable Capacity**

Margin (LTOCM), the Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM), the Short Term
Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM), and the Short Term Locational Operable
Capacity Margin (STLOCM).

**Outage Types:**

**Forced Outage (FO) is any outage or inability, in whole or in part, of a Resource to**

provide its claimed capability or NCL, or any DRR outage as described in Section
I.B above, that has not been approved by ISO in the form of a PO or MO. An FO
incident preceding a PO or MO shall not eliminate the requirement of the MP to
report an FO for the entire actual/estimated period to repair the component(s)
associated with the FO. Among other things, an FO may occur by reason of an
Emergency or threatened Emergency, unanticipated failure, or other cause beyond
the control of the owner or operator of the facility, as specified in the relevant
portions of Section III of the Tariff and ISO New England Manuals.

**Maintenance Outage (MO) (identified as “Short-Term Outage” in the ISO outage**

**software) is an outage that can be deferred beyond the end of the weekend, but**
requires that the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR be removed from service within
14 calendar days of the outage start date. During any particular week, if an MP
requests an outage that cannot be deferred beyond the weekend, that outage shall
be classified as a Forced Outage. ISO shall attempt to, in accordance with the
request, accommodate an MO as soon as possible depending on system
conditions, significant increases in Locational Marginal Price (LMP), and
Congestion Costs. This outage is coordinated in the MO request processes.
Characteristically, an MO can occur any time during the year, has a flexible start


-----

date, may or may not have a predetermined duration. Typically, these Resource
outages are less than 14 days in duration.

**Overrun Planned Outage (OPO) is an overrun of a PO that may be requested up until**
the Thursday, or the week prior to, the scheduled return of a generator, DRR, or DARD, or
ATRR to service. An OPO is considered a type of MO throughout this document. The
outage must be limited to the original Planned Outage work scope and must not be
requested for newly discovered issues (a new request shall be submitted for newly
discovered work).

**Planned Outage (PO) is an outage that must be requested with a minimum of 15**

calendar days prior to start date and is typically scheduled for the purpose of
performing annual maintenance or more significant work that is planned and
coordinated well in advance.

**Owner Test Request is a request that must be submitted to ISO when the MP has owner**

testing to perform and wants to ensure their generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR will be
able to operate at a predefined schedule during that testing. If a request for owner
testing is not submitted by an MP, transmission outages may be approved that could
prevent the desired testing from occurring in the desired period. The MP shall submit
and ISO shall evaluate an Owner Test request in the same manner as an MO request.

**Reactive Capability Audit Request (RCAR) is a request submitted to ISO when an MP**

has testing that will result in injection or absorption of a specific reactive power value
from the Resource. The RCAR shall be submitted to ISO in accordance with ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing. The MP shall submit the
outage as MVAr testing and ISO shall evaluate the RCAR in the same manner as an
MO request, except that ISO shall respond to the RCAR within the time frame
designated in the Response Time Table below.

**Short-Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM) is a measure of the**

projected daily operable capacity margin looking ahead 2 weeks or less on a New
England sub-area basis, as described in OP-5A.

**Short-Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM) is a measure of New England**

RCA/BAA projected daily operable capacity margin looking ahead 2 weeks or less
based on the assumptions in OP-5A. A positive value of STOCM indicates a potential
surplus of operable capacity over and above the estimated load plus Operating
Reserve requirement. The STOCM formula and its components are defined in OP-5A.

**Sub-Area is a local area within the New England RCA/BAA requiring coordination of**

generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR and transmission outages.

**NOTE**

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this OP shall have the meanings ascribed to

them in the Tariff.


-----

**III. PROCEDURES**

**A. ISO** **&** **LCC** **RESPONSIBILITIES**

**1. General**

a. Evaluation Principles

ISO shall assign each outage request an outage tracking number, upon receipt.
Each request shall be time- and date-stamped for prioritization purposes.

ISO and the LCC shall evaluate each generator, DRR, or DARD outage
request submitted by a Lead MP for the items listed below. Outages of
transmission facilities shall be included as a part of this evaluation. Criteria
contained in this Section III.A.1 pertain to each generator/DRR/DARD outage
that impacts the CSO of the associated capacity Resource. ISO and the LCC
shall conduct their evaluation as follows:

i. Identify if the proposed Resource outage results in an unacceptable
OCM.

ii. Identify if the proposed generator, DRR, or DARD outage results in
any system or local system reliability impacts.

iii. Identify opportunities where the proposed generator, DRR, or DARD
outage could be adjusted with respect to a pending transmission
outage to reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs.

**2. PO Review Moratorium**

a. Annual Forward Capacity Market (FCM) Reliability Review

During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of the results of the
third annual reconfiguration auction results for the applicable FCM Capacity
Commitment Period, ISO shall time-stamp PO requests for outages that fall within
June 1 and September 15 of the FCM Capacity Commitment Period to establish
review priority and hold until the third annual reconfiguration auction results
reliability review is completed.

b. Monthly FCM Reliability Review

During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM monthly CSO
bilateral submissions and monthly reconfiguration auction results for the applicable
month, ISO shall time-stamp each PO request for an outage that falls within the
applicable month to establish review priority, and hold until the reliability review
process is completed.

**3. Outage Request Approval Principles**

The MP shall request ISO approval to remove a generator, DRR, or DARD from
service for a PO or MO in accordance with this OP when that generator, DRR or


-----

DARD outage may impact the CSO of the associated capacity Resource. When
the generator, DRR or DARD outage does not impact the CSO of the associated
capacity Resource, the MP shall provide notification to ISO in accordance with this
OP.

ISO shall approve any PO or MO request to the extent that it would not, in ISO or
LCC judgment, cause an unacceptable OCM or violate any NERC, Northeast
Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC), or ISO operating criteria, policy or
procedure. Once approved, an MP shall not subsequently be required to alter its
PO request if unacceptable OCM conditions arise as a result of another
generator/DRR/DARD or transmission outage. However, ISO may delay the start
of an outage for reliability reasons.

ISO shall prioritize the outage requests for any given time period on a first-come,
first-served basis.

ISO may reject an outage request if, in ISO judgment, the requested outage would
cause an unacceptable LTOCM or LOCM (as defined in Section III.B.1.b of this
OP) or STOCM or STLOCM (as defined in Section III.C.1.b of this OP).

ISO shall coordinate with the LCCs regarding any outage repositioning. The daily
posting of the “Annual Maintenance Schedule” (AMS) shall provide the LCCs with
information regarding any repositioned outages occurring later in the year. For an
MO request, ISO provides the relevant LCC with the outage information. The LCC
shall notify ISO if an outage repositioning poses any local system reliability impact
within its local area. Additionally, to reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs, the
LCCs and ISO shall promote the continuous flow of information between them and
the Transmission Owners (TOs) in an effort to match proposed generator, DRR, or
DARD POs or FOs with pending transmission outage work to the extent
practicable.

**B. PLANNED** **OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **AND** **EVALUATION** **PROCESS**

Where the PO request affects the CSO of associated capacity Resource, or of the
associated ADCR as described in Section I.B, or is associated with a generator
without a CSO that is a qualified Reactive Resource, an MP shall request ISO
approval to schedule a PO in accordance with this OP. Where the generator PO
request does not affect the CSO of the associated capacity Resource or is associated
with a generator that does not have a CSO, the MP shall notify ISO of its PO schedule
in accordance with this OP.

**1. PO Request Processing**

a. ISO and the respective LCC shall respond to MP PO requests on a first
come, first-served basis for any defined submittal period. The respective
LCC shall review the PO request and continue the requested PO
progression for ISO review if the impact on local reliability within its area is
acceptable.

b. ISO shall evaluate the impact of the PO request on the OCM (as defined in


-----

OP-5A) and evaluate if approved transmission outages would interfere with
the PO request. A PO shall not be approved if the security analysis
considering all approved transmission network element outage identifies a
violation(s) of ISO, LCC, NERC or NPCC criteria.

c. If ISO determines that the requested PO is not acceptable, then ISO shall

discuss with the LCC, alternative dates when the system reliability
conditions are projected to be more favorable. The LCC shall work with the
TO and the generator, DRR, or DARD MP to reposition the PO. If the MP is
not willing or not able to move the PO to a period where capacity and
security criteria can be met, the PO request shall be denied.

d. In an effort to reduce Congestion Costs, ISO shall also compare the

generator, DRR, or DARD PO request against approved transmission
outage schedules to identify cases where the generator, DRR, or DARD PO
schedules could be adjusted to meet this objective. If a potential schedule
adjustment is identified, ISO shall discuss PO rescheduling with the LCC.
The LCC shall coordinate rescheduling with the respective TO and the
generator, DRR, or DARD MP. (Throughout this process, ISO shall work
with the respective LCC, as needed, to develop alternative PO schedules.)

e. Upon coordination of generator, DRR, or DARD PO and transmission outage

schedules, ISO shall perform its final review to confirm that the New
England RCA/BAA and LCC reliability requirements are satisfied,
coordination actions are in order, and Congestion Costs have been reduced
or eliminated. Following this review, ISO shall:

i. Notify the MP if its request is approved as submitted, or approved with

modifications in accordance with this OP.

ii. Publish the PO in the next update of the AMS.

**2. ISO Reporting**

ISO shall publish the current AMS, to the ISO external website daily. If the
published AMS poses any local system reliability impact within its local area,
each LCC shall notify ISO’s Long Term Outage Coordination staff by electronic
[media (email) at opamoreq@iso-ne.com within five (5) Business Days. [Local](mailto:opamoreq@isone.com)
system reliability issues identified at this point should be minimal since each
generator, DRR, or DARD PO request is forwarded to the respective LCC(s) for
local review and approval following ISO’s initial evaluation.]

ISO shall aggregate approved MP PO requests, and ISO shall provide the
projected weekly LTOCM for the New England RCA/BAA for two (2)
consecutive calendar years. This process provides the MPs with a planning
tool for reviewing their maintenance requirements and timing of their own
operable capacity needs with the market signals of the New England
RCA/BAA. This process provides ISO with a method for coordinating


-----

generator, DRR, or DARD maintenance requirements to avoid OP-4 or OP-7
actions, and as a result, ISO can identify potential capacity-deficient periods.
Additionally, the process provides ISO and the LCCs with the necessary
information to identify situations where generator, DRR, or DARD and
transmission outages could potentially be coordinated to reduce Congestion
Costs.

**3. Resolution of a Reliability Issue**

If ISO determines that a reliability issue exists after it has approved a PO that is
reflected in the AMS, ISO shall work with the LCC and the MP to reposition a
previously-approved generator, DRR, or DARD PO to avoid or eliminate
unacceptable forecasted LTOCM, LOCM, or reliability issues that have arisen
since that approval was granted.

Where a reliability issue cannot be eliminated through ISO discussions with the
affected MP by seventy-five (75) calendar days prior to the start of the reliability
issue, ISO shall perform the following steps in order:

a. Within seventy-five (75) calendar days of the reliability issue, ISO shall

notify, in writing, all MPs that have requested a PO during the period where
an unacceptable LTOCM or LOCM is projected and request that all MPs
either voluntarily reposition their PO request or provide ISO with alternatives
for repositioning their PO request. The MPs shall have fifteen (15)
Business Days to respond to the ISO request.

b. If the problem is not resolved within 30 calendar days of written notification

of the reliability issue to the MPs, the ISO may reject one or all of the PO
requests as described in this OP. In making its determination, ISO shall
group the requests by time-stamp, and then apply an allocation method.
The ISO allocation method is used to allocate the capacity available for a
PO. ISO shall notify the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Markets
Committee that the problem exists, that voluntary repositioning has not
resolved the problem, and that ISO must implement an allocation process.

The allocation process starts with the most recent group of PO requests.
The allocation method is based on the ratio of a requesting MP’s total
generating CSO and DARD NCL compared to the sum of the requesting
group total generating CSO and DARD NCL. This ratio is multiplied by the
capacity available for maintenance to determine the MP allocation.
Previously-approved PO requests shall not be subjected to the allocation
process. If the MP allocation represents at least ninety percent (90%) of the
generating CSO or a DARD NCL to be removed from service, ISO shall
approve the PO request. If the MP allocation represents less than ninety
percent (90%) of the generator, DRR, or DARD capacity to be removed
from service, the generator, DRR, or DARD outage shall be relocated. ISO
shall notify the MPs of the result of the allocation process no later than 55
calendar days prior to the start of any PO.

c. Following ISO imposition of the allocation method and by forty-five (45)


-----

calendar days prior to the commencement of a PO, if any MP refuses to
relocate its generator, DRR, or DARD PO for any month included in this
allocation process, then the ISO shall classify the outage as an FO.

**C. MAINTENANCE** **OUTAGE** **AND** **OVERRUN** **PLANNED** **OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **AND**

**EVALUATION** **PROCESS**

An MP shall request ISO approval to schedule an MO or OPO if:

(i) the MO or OPO impacts the CSO of the associated Resource,

(ii) the MO or OPO of the DRR is for 5 MW or more and results in the associated

ADCR falling short of its CSO by 5 MW or more, or

(iii) the MO or OPO is associated with a Resource without a CSO that is a qualified

Reactive Resource.

If an MO or OPO does not impact the CSO of the associated capacity Resource or if
the generator does not have a CSO, the MP shall notify ISO of the MO or OPO.

**1. Processing of MO and OPO Requests**

ISO and the respective LCC shall respond to each MO and OPO request as
follows:

a. Response time shall be based on the following table:

**Response Time Table**

**Submission of MO Request or OPO** **for an**
**Response time by ISO**
**Outage Start of:**

5 Business Days in the future (RCAR)* Within 4 Business Days

     - Has testing that will result in injection or absorption of a specific reactive power value from the

Resource per OP-23

** During any particular week, if an MP requests an outage that cannot be deferred beyond the

weekend, that outage shall be classified as a Forced Outage.

*** An OPO is not applicable in this timeframe
**** Request shall be evaluated considering Day-Ahead Energy Market and Reserve Adequacy

-----

b. If an MO request results in the forecast of any actions of OP-4 or OP-7, ISO

shall attempt to relocate the MO request to an acceptable period in which
reliability issues would not be expected to arise. If a request for an OPO
results in any actions of OP-4 or OP-7, ISO shall deny the OPO request.

c. With prospective MO or OPO dates identified (that do not affect system

reliability), the ISO shall provide the MO or OPO request information to the
respective LCC.

d. The LCC shall notify ISO if the MO or OPO request poses a local

transmission reliability problem. If it does, ISO shall work with the LCC and
the MP to resolve the issue.

e. In an effort to reduce Congestion Costs, ISO shall compare the generator,

DRR, or DARD MO or OPO request against approved transmission outage
schedules to identify cases where the generator, DRR, or DARD MO or
OPO schedules could be adjusted to meet this objective. If a potential
schedule adjustment is identified, ISO shall discuss rescheduling with the
LCC. The LCC shall coordinate rescheduling with the respective TO and
the MP. (Throughout this process, ISO shall work with the respective LCC,
as needed, to develop alternative outage schedules.)

f. ISO, coordinating with the respective LCC, shall proceed as follows

depending on whether the case involves:

(1) an importing area,

(2) Generators, DRRs, or DARDs or an exporting area involving a single
MP, or

(3) an exporting area involving multiple generators, DRRs, or DARDs
involving multiple MPs.

i. Importing area

For an importing area, the simultaneous outage of transmission
supplying the area along with generators, DRRs, or DARDs within the
area can increase Congestion Costs and, in severe cases, jeopardize
system reliability. To relieve this, the following actions shall be taken
to try to position the transmission and generators, DRRs, or DARDs
MOs or OPOs so that they occur at different times.
```
      o The LCC shall contact the MP for the generators, DRRs, or

```
DARDs to determine if there is additional flexibility in the MO or
OPO position.
```
      o The LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in the

```
TO’s schedule. (Generator, DRR, or DARD outage information
may be discussed with the TO, as needed.)
```
      o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO

```

-----

and the MP until a determination is made on whether or not
activities can be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion
Costs. [Note: If the above actions are not sufficient to relieve
congestion, then ISO shall dispatch generators/DRRs/DARDs
in accordance with the congestion management process or
change the timing of the transmission outage.]

ii. Generator, DRR, or DARD or exporting area involving a single MP

This scenario involves a transmission outage that would restrict the
commitment or dispatch of a generator, DRR, or DARD involving a
single MP (i.e., a line leaving a generator, DRR, or DARD station).
The following actions shall be taken as soon as possible to try to
change or create outage positions so that generator, DRR, or DARD
and transmission outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the
potential locked-in generator, DRR, or DARD.
```
   o The LCC shall contact the MP for the generator, DRR, or

```
DARD to determine if there is additional flexibility for the timing
of the generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO.
```
   o LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in the TO’s

```
timing of the outage (generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO
outage information may be discussed with the TO, as needed).
```
   o If the transmission outage involves a radial circuit to a

```
generator, DRR, or DARD, this information may be shared with
the MP. Additionally, non-radial transmission outage
information may be shared with the MP if the transmission
outage solely affects that MP.
```
   o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO

```
and the generator, DRR, or DARD MP until a determination is
made on whether or not activities can be scheduled to
reduce/eliminate Congestion Costs.
```
   o The TO may contact the MP directly to facilitate positioning of

```
MOs or OPOs.

iii. Exporting area involving multiple generator, DRRs, or DARDs and

multiple MPs

This case involves a transmission outage that would restrict the
commitment or dispatch of generators, DRRs, or DARDs within an
exporting area with several generators, DRRs, or DARDs involving
multiple MPs. The following actions shall be taken to try to change or
create outage positions so that generators, DRRs, or DARDs and
transmission outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the
potential locked-in generator, DRR, or DARD.


-----

```
         o The LCC shall contact the applicable MPs, in the order in

```
which MO or OPO requests were received to determine if there
is additional flexibility in their generators’, DRRs’, or DARDs’
outage position.
```
         o The LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in its

```
position. (Generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO information
may be discussed with the TO, as needed.)
```
         o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO

```
and MPs until a determination is made on whether or not
outages may be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion
Costs.
```
         o If generators, DRRs, or DARDs with MO or OPO requests

```
cannot be repositioned or no MO or OPO requests exist, the
LCC shall contact affected MPs to inform them that a
transmission outage may result in their generator, DRR, or
DARD being restricted and to determine if they desire to
coordinate an MO or OPO of their generator, DRR or DARD
with the transmission outage.
```
         o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO

```
and MPs until a determination is made on whether or not
outages may be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion
Costs.

g. Upon agreement among ISO, the relevant LCC, the TO, and the MPs for

the generators, DRRs, or DARDs involved, ISO shall:

(1) perform a final analysis to confirm that the New England RCA/BAA-wide
and LCC reliability requirements are satisfied and that Congestion Costs
have been reduced or eliminated;

(2) notify the MP for the generators, DRRs, or DARDs that the request is
either approved as submitted, or approved with modifications in accordance
with this OP; and

(3) if applicable, update short-term transmission outage information on the
ISO external website.

**2. MO and OPO Requests ISO Reporting**

ISO shall notify the submitter of the MO or OPO request of the decision made by
ISO, but shall not have an obligation to notify any other person or entity with an
ownership or contractual interest in the Resource for which the MO or OPO has
been submitted.


-----

**D. OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **ON** **NON-CSO** **RESOURCE** **ENROLLED** **IN** **SCHEDULE** **2**

information required in OP-5B.

**3. Changes To Previously Submitted Outage Requests**

An MP request to modify a previously submitted PO, MO, or OPO, request shall
follow the same process as described in Section III of this OP. ISO shall accept a
change request that reduces the scope or duration of the PO, MO, or OPO without
impacting the time-stamp of the PO, MO, or OPO request. ISO shall accept a
change request that increases the scope or changes the dates of the PO, MO, or
OPO such that a new outage evaluation is required as a new PO, MO, or OPO
request, which shall be time-stamped accordingly.

**4. Requesting Implementation Of Outage**

Immediately prior to commencing scheduled work, the MP shall obtain ISO Control
Room approval for any generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR PO and MO request.
ISO shall not withhold such approval unless the consequences of granting the
approval would result in a risk of the OP-4 action where a Power Watch is
declared (Action 4) or higher or OP-7 actions, or other serious reliability risk. ISO
shall inform the respective LCC when the generator, DRR, or DARD is offline and
out-of-service. For a DRR, a request for implementation of a PO, MO or OPO
shall be entered in eMarket as the DRR’s bid parameters reflecting the
implemented PO, MO or OPO.

**5. Notifying FO**

If an FO is declared, the MP shall notify the ISO Control Room Generation
Operator with an appropriate redeclaration for the current Operating Day. The ISO
Generation Coordinator shall be contacted at (413) 535-4378 from 0700 to 1530,
or the ISO Control Room Forecaster by telephone at (413) 535-4340 from 1530 to
0700, for the purpose of providing an expected FO return date, and to provide any
necessary redeclaration for any future days for which the bidding deadline has
passed. These notifications shall be made as soon as practicable.

**6. Notifying ISO Of Return-To-Service**

An MP shall notify ISO of the completion of the PO, MO or OPO by releasing the
generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR to ISO for dispatch. If the MP does not expect
to return the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR to service on the Operating Day
indicated on the PO, MO or OPO request, then the MP shall notify ISO of the


-----

expected return date for the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR, which may be
captured in a new PO, MO or OPO request. For a DRR, the notification of returnto-service after the PO, MO or OPO shall be entered in eMarket as the DRR’s bid
parameters reflecting the return–to-service after the PO, MO or OPO.

and Authority

**PART I - INTRODUCTION**

The Participants Agreement, ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and
Service Tariff, Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA), other transmission
operating agreements and Market Participant Service Agreements provide ISO New
England (ISO) with the operating responsibility and authority necessary to reliably
and efficiently operate the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing
Authority Area (RCA/BAA) in compliance with ISO New England Operating
Documents, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Northeast
Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) Standards and in accordance with Good
Utility Practice.

Because central dispatch responsibilities are divided and/or shared between ISO, the
Local Control Centers (LCCs), Transmission Owners (TOs) and Market Participants
(MPs), it is necessary to establish overall responsibilities and authority. This
Operating Procedure (OP) defines the overall parameters within which the more
specific ISO New England Operating Procedures can be formulated.

**PART II - PRINCIPLES**

The following principles are adopted. Appendix A expands upon the principles by
assigning responsibilities to specific operational groups.

1. ISO is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the New England RCA/BAA

in accordance with applicable rules and procedures.

2. An LCC has a responsibility to each TO whose equipment they operate. Also,

each LCC has a responsibility to assist ISO in meeting the objectives of
central dispatch by carrying out instructions, orders and directions received
from ISO.

3. To most efficiently achieve the objective of central dispatch, it is necessary

that ISO, each LCC, each TO and each MP execute their responsibilities with
a spirit of cooperation and with an understanding of the tasks to be
accomplished.

**PART III - GENERAL STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES**

**ISO Responsibilities**

ISO, as the System Operator, is responsible for matters pertaining to the central
dispatch of each facility in each of the following categories:

     - Transmission facility over which it has operational control pursuant to the TOA

and other transmission operating agreements

     - Resources as defined by the Tariff in Section I.2.2.

**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**


-----

and Authority

In compliance with NERC and NPCC requirements, agreements to which ISO is a
party and ISO New England Operating Documents and under normal and emergency
system operating conditions, the responsibilities and authorities assigned to ISO
extends to include decisions, instructions, and orders issued to an LCC, TO or MP
facility electronically, verbally or in writing, as required for day-to-day, minute-tominute operation of each facility in each of the categories listed above.

**LCC Responsibilities**

Each LCC has a comprehensive responsibility for the security of certain facilities
within the New England RCA/BAA over which it has operational control, including
certain Category A and Category B transmission facilities, Other Transmission
Facilities, Merchant Transmission Facilities and Local Facilities, as those terms and
facilities are defined in the TOA or other transmission operating agreements, as
applicable.

Individual LCC responsibilities may include SCADA functions, security of lower
voltage transmission facilities, coordination of generator/DARD activities and
switching and tagging of facilities not performed by the MP or TO.

These extended responsibilities are established by the individual LCC member
companies subject to the general provisions of this OP.

**MP & TO Responsibilities**

Each TO shall, to the fullest extent practical, cause each transmission facility rated at
69 kV or above owned or controlled by it, to be designed, constructed, maintained
and operated in accordance with Good Utility Practice.

Each MP shall, to the fullest extent practical, cause each generator, DARD, DRR,
and ATRR for which they are the Lead Market Participant, to be designed,
constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with Good Utility Practice.

MP and TO facilities will also contribute to central dispatch in accordance with
approved ISO New England Operating Procedures, Market Rule 1 and procedures,
manuals and ISO New England Transmission Operating Guides.

**ISO, LCC, TO & MP Shared Responsibilities**

ISO, each LCC, each TO and each MP share the responsibility to initiate dispatch
action(s) necessary to prevent injury, loss of life, equipment damage, violations to
safety, regulatory or statutory requirements and/or service interruptions.

**A. BACKGROUND**

Transmission outages for construction, tests, maintenance or repair must be
coordinated to ensure that reliability is maintained at levels prescribed by ISO New
England (ISO) Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19). In
addition, whenever possible, transmission and Resource outages will be coordinated
to reduce congestion costs. For importing areas, economic Resources within the
area should not be scheduled out coincident with transmission facilities that
significantly support area import capability. For exporting areas, Resource outages
within the area should be coordinated coincident with the outage of transmission
facilities that significantly support area export capabilities.

In addition, this procedure, ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3), is to be construed throughout as reflecting
that ISO possesses the ultimate authority for approval of proposed schedules and
rescheduling of proposed or approved transmission outages based on either
reliability or market efficiency considerations. The processes described in OP-3 are
those that ISO will generally use to consider outage approval, scheduling and
rescheduling, but shall not diminish or limit ISO’s ultimate authority as described in
the preceding sentence.

**B. PURPOSE** **OF** **PROCEDURE**

The purpose of OP-3 is to:

  - Facilitate the preparation, by each Transmission Owner (TO) and each Local

Control Center (LCC), of TO Long-Term and Short-Term outage plans for their
transmission facilities

  - Establish a Long-Term and Short-Term outage request process and a timeline for

such outage requests

  - Coordinate transmission outages with Resource outages to plan for reliable

operations and minimize congestion

  - Establish a Long-Term and Short-Term outage scheduling process that does not

jeopardize the reliability of the transmission system and continues to minimize
congestion

  - Provide guidelines for responding to unplanned outages

OP-3 defines Category A Facilities, Category B Facilities, Major Transmission
Elements (MTE), and Local Area Facilities and also establishes criteria and guides
for submitting, evaluating, approving, and denying or repositioning all work on these
facilities. A complete list and description of Category A and B Facilities under the
ISO New England Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA) can be found on the
ISO’s OASIS website. Whereas Local Area Facilities involve sub-transmission
facilities (below 69kV) that have been delegated to LCCs within New England, a list
of these facilities is not called for by the TOA between ISO and TOs nor required for
purposes of OP-3.


-----

Definitions used in this Procedure:

Capitalized terms used but **not otherwise defined in OP-3 have the meanings ascribed**
thereto in the ISO Tariff, the ISO New England Manuals, the Second Restated New
England Power Pool Agreement and the Participants Agreement.

  - **Category A Facilities:**

**NOTE**

**_The term Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) and its definition has been adopted_**
**_by NPCC in place of the term Special Protection System (SPS). For existing_**
**_documentation, the terms Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Special_**
**_Protection System (SPS) may be used until such time as the terminology is_**
**_changed by the Transmission Owner on equipment and schematics used in_**
**_operations and in the field. However, a subset of SPSs were not recognized_**
**_as RAS and instead became Automatic Control Schemes (ACS)_**

Category A Facilities include all transmission lines with a voltage level of 115 kV
and above, except for those 115 kV transmission facilities specifically designated
as Category B Facilities in accordance with the current TOA Categories of
Transmission Facilities Section 2.01(e)(ii); all transmission interties between
Control Areas; all transformers that have Category A Facilities connected to the
lower voltage side of the transformer; all transformers that require a Category A
Facility to be taken out-of-service when the transformer is taken out-of-service;
and all breakers and disconnects connected to, and all shunts, relays, reclosing
and associated equipment, dynamic reactive resources, Flexible Alternating
Current Transmission System (FACTS) controllers, Remedial Action Schemes
(RAS) or Automatic Control Schemes (ACS), Phase Shifting Transformers (PSTs),
and other equipment specifically installed to support the operation of such
transmission lines, interties, and transformers.

  - **Category B Facilities:**

Category B Facilities include all 115 kV radial transmission lines and all 69 kV
transmission lines that are not interties between Control Areas; all transformers
that have any Category B Facilities and no Category A Facilities connected to the
lower voltage side of the transformer except to the extent such transformers are
designated as Category A Facilities in accordance with the current TOA
Categories of Transmission Facilities Section 2.01(e)(i); and all breakers and
disconnects connected to, and all shunts, relays, reclosing and associated
equipment, dynamic reactive resources, FACTS controllers, RASs or ACSs,
PSTs, and other equipment specifically installed to support the operation of such
Category B Facilities.


-----

- **Local Area Facilities:**

The transmission facilities of a Participating Transmission Owner (PTO) within the
New England Transmission System with a voltage level of less than 69 kV and all
transformers that have no Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities connected
to the lower voltage side of the transformer that are not listed in TOA Categories
of Transmission Facilities Schedule 2.01(a), Schedule 2.01(b) and are not
excluded facilities. Section 2.01(e)(iii) of the TOA defines Local Area Facilities as
including “all transmission facilities with a voltage level of less than 69 kV and all
transformers that have no Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities connected
to the lower voltage side of the transformer.

- **Congestion Costs:**

The estimated increased expenses resulting from forecasted real-time
commitment or re-dispatch of “out of merit” Resources and/or the forecasted realtime re-dispatch or de-commitment of “in merit” Resources in the Energy &
Reserves Markets to respect operating criteria.

- **Long-Term Transmission Outage:**

A Planned Transmission Outage submitted for ISO Interim-Approval up to two (2)

years and greater than or equal to twenty-one (21) days prior to the day the
outage is scheduled to begin.

- **Major Transmission Elements (MTE):**

MTE are a subset of Category A Facilities and Category B Facilities that affect

Resources and may be further identified as, but not limited to, facilities defined or
referenced in:
```
   o Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) Facilities for Notification
   o Defined external interfaces
   o Defined internal interfaces
   o Restrictions on the operation of a Resource
   o A Transmission Operating Guide (TOG)

```
As a result of the above criteria, MTE (acting individually) may have a significant
impact on the reliable and/or economic operation of the New England
Transmission System and as a result, may have greater exposure to being
cancelled or denied because of economic impacts than other transmission
facilities.

A list of MTE equipment is provided in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No.

Element Listing.


-----

- **Resource**

Is identified as a Generator Asset, a Dispatchable Asset Related Demand
(DARD), an External Resource, and a Demand Response Resource.

- **Opportunity Outage**

This is an outage that does not satisfy the minimum advance notice time required
for Planned Short-Term Transmission Outage processing and is submitted for ISO
Approval as a result of an unexpected opportunity to accomplish work that would
otherwise require another outage at a less opportune time. An Opportunity
Outage shall be coordinated to minimize the overall impact on system reliability
and market efficiency. An Opportunity Outage is categorized as neither Planned
**nor Unplanned and is most often initiated by, but not limited to, any of the**
following:
```
   o An Unplanned Resource Outage; 
   o Expedited completion of a Transmission or Resource outage (or project); 
   o Forecasted operating conditions are favorable for the work to be performed

```
An Opportunity Outage request shall be submitted to ISO no more than one
hundred and twenty (120) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to begin
and no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to
begin. When the proper studies are completed and if the Opportunity Outage is
Approved, that Opportunity Outage is included in the Day-Ahead Energy Market
(DAM) transmission topology assumptions. An Opportunity Outage, whether
Approved or Implemented, shall not be permitted if that Opportunity Outage
imposes additional restrictions on MW Resources (Resources and/or inter-ties)
that would not otherwise exist in the absence of the Opportunity Outage.

An Opportunity Outage request submitted to ISO must adhere to the following
additional conditions:
```
   o Restoration (recall) time, does not exceed eight (8) hours
   o Limited duration, does not exceed one hundred and eight (108) hour period
   o If an underway transmission outage unexpectedly exceeds either of the

```
above timing criterion, the entire Opportunity Outage shall be converted to a
Forced Outage
```
   o An Opportunity Outage shall receive the lowest priority when competing

```
with all other outage types that are Planned or Unplanned

- **Planned Outage:**

A transmission outage request that satisfies the minimum advance notice times
associated with either the Long-Term or Short-Term Transmission Outage
processing.

- **Recall Time:**

The measured time from when ISO/LCC requests an LCC/TO to safely restore a
transmission element from outage state to in-service.


-----

- **Short-Term Transmission Outage:**

A Planned Transmission Outage submitted for ISO Approval less than twenty-one
(21) days and greater than one hundred and twenty (120) hours prior to 0001 of
the day the outage is scheduled to begin.

- **Significantly Reduced Congestion Costs:**

Reductions in forecasted real-time congestion and Net Commitment-Period
Compensation (NCPC) costs resulting from the repositioning of a transmission
outage are considered significant when the reduction minus the PTO’s incremental
direct costs for repositioning the outage exceeds $200,000 per week or any
portion of a week.

- **Transmission Outage Request Flags:**

One or more of the following additional identifiers may be associated with each
outage to set outage priority as described in this definition section:

`o` **Long-Term Economic Approval**

`o` **Outage Overrun**

- **Transmission Outage Request Status:**

One of the following:

`o` **Active Status**

   - **Preliminary: Planned Transmission Outage provided to ISO for**

informational purposes only; no studies shall be conducted by ISO until the
outage has been moved to the status of Submitted by the LCC

   - **Submitted: Transmission outages prepared for ISO study and acceptance**

and awaiting Interim Approved Status or Approved Status

   - **Study: Transmission outages actively being studied and evaluated by ISO**

to determine Interim Approved Status or Approved Status

   - **Negotiate: Transmission outages under additional review and/or pending**

repositioning

   - **Interim Approved: Transmission outages that have been studied and**

accepted by ISO through the Long-Term Transmission Outage process but
waiting final Approved status through the Short-Term Transmission Outage
Process

   - **Approved: Transmission outages studied and accepted by ISO in**

accordance with the Short-Term Transmission Outage process

   - **Implemented: Transmission outage that has begun, reflecting equipment**

taken out-of-service or in an abnormal state


-----

`o` **Non-Active Status**

   - **Withdrawn: Preliminary Transmission outages that are no longer planned**

by the TO or have lapsed within twenty-one (21) days prior to the start date

   - **Denied: Transmission outage requests which have not been Approved or**

Interim Approved

   - **Cancelled: Previously Approved Transmission outages (Interim Approved**

or Approved) that have been called off by the TO, LCC or ISO

   - **Completed: A Transmission outage that had been returned to service**

- **Unplanned Outage:**

This is any outage that cannot be planned and fails to satisfy the lead times
required for Planned Short-Term Transmission Outage processing. The following
are the three types of Unplanned Outages:

**1. Emergency Outage**

The obvious failure of a piece of transmission equipment that comes out-ofservice on its own or requires immediate operator intervention to remove it
from service.

**2. Forced Outage**

The discovery of a problem that needs to be repaired as soon as crews,
equipment, and/or corrective dispatch actions may be put in place to allow the
work to be performed. By definition, a Forced Outage cannot be scheduled.
More specifically:

   - A Forced Outage cannot be delayed to avoid paying overtime rates; e.g.,

on a Friday, delaying a Forced Outage until Monday, rather than performing
the work on Saturday. This implies that a Forced Outage must occur on
consecutive days, except in the case described in the next bullet.

   - A Forced Outage cannot schedule an Alternate Date. If weather impairs

safe work conditions, the outage may be moved to the next available fair
weather day, and the planned end date/time shall be extended.

   - An Opportunity Outage that unexpectedly causes additional adverse impact

on either system reliability or market efficiency beyond that which was
originally anticipated. Typically this would be associated with the
unexpected extension of the defined timing parameters.

**3. Overrun Outage**

This is any outage that fails to return to service by its planned end date, and
the outage has extended into the next calendar day.


-----

**III. AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

**A. ISO** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**

ISO shall:

    - Receive from LCCs, Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests

that were approved by the LCCs, for all Category A Facilities, and for Category B
Facilities if Resource output could be affected by the outage. Outage requests
for Local Area Facilities that affect Resource output shall be processed using
LCC and ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource Maintenance
and Outage Scheduling (OP-5) scheduling practices.

    - Review proposed outages in the Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission

Outage requests and compare them to Resource outage plans as follows:
```
     o Evaluate the impact of proposed transmission outages on the reliability of the

```
New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area
(RCA/BAA) power system operations. Reposition or deny any outage that
could be expected to violate reliability criteria for the New England
Transmission System and for which repositioning the outage could reasonably
be expected to improve reliability.

**NOTE**

ISO will coordinate efforts with the LCCs to evaluate the risk of implemented
or proposed transmission outages that may pose a risk to system reliability
based on forecasted loads or current or expected system conditions. ISO
and the LCCs should attempt to mitigate this risk by repositioning or
recalling transmission outages that could impact transfer capability on
interfaces internal and external to ISO, restrict or isolate a Resource, or
impact energy security.
```
     o Work with LCCs to adjust Resource and transmission outages to minimize

```
congestion costs. When warranted, and time permitting, perform economic
analyses of outage alternatives to define and examine potential congestion
costs. Reposition the outage if Significantly Reduced Congestion Costs are
feasible, or where lesser congestion reduction is available and the TO(s)
agree.
```
     o Have the authority to reposition or deny any outage that adversely impacts

```
market efficiency.
```
     o Support outage scheduling related communications between TOs and

```
Resource owners to assure affected parties are appropriately notified in a
timely manner.

    - Appropriately notify LCCs and Market Participants (MPs) of action regarding

outage requests.


-----

   - Assign to the LCCs the function of receiving, evaluating, approving or denying

transmission outage requests submitted by a TO, with respect to its impact on the
reliability and congestion of LCC operations.

   - Promote the continuous flow of information between ISO, LCCs, and TOs to

match pending transmission outage work with planned or forced Resource
outages to the extent practicable.

   - Monitor the outage positioning activities of the TOs. ISO shall have the right to

request that a TO provide information to ISO Market Monitoring concerning any
TO positioning of transmission facility outages, including the repositioning or
cancellation of any Planned, Scheduled or Approved Outage.

   - Assign each Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage request a number,

date stamp and Status. In general, the number, date stamp and Status will be
used, if needed, to prioritize outage requests. ISO will attempt to resolve
conflicting Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests through
discussions with the affected LCCs. When discussions cannot resolve the
conflict, the Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage that was Submitted
earliest shall have priority.

   - Post and maintain a list of requested outages with corresponding Status on the

ISO external website within the limitations of the ISO New England Information
Policy.

**NOTE**

In accordance with the ISO New England Information Policy and to avoid the potential
exercising of market power by any entity, outages that will isolate a Resource (such as
radial circuits to Resources) will not be posted.

**B. LCC** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**

LCCs shall:

   - Receive TO Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests from TOs

for all Category A Facilities, and for Category B Facilities if Resource output could
be affected by the outage. Outage requests for Local Area Facilities that affect
Resource output shall be processed using LCC and ISO
OP-5 scheduling practices

   - Prior to submitting proposed outages to ISO for final evaluation and approval,

review proposed Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests and
compare them with Resource outage plans and requests received from ISO as
follows:
```
    o Evaluate the impacts of proposed transmission outages on the reliability of

```
LCC operations. Reposition or disapprove any outage that could be expected
to violate LCC reliability criteria and for which repositioning the outage could
reasonably be expected to improve reliability


-----

**NOTE**

ISO will coordinate efforts with the LCCs to evaluate the risk of implemented
or proposed transmission outages that may pose a risk to system reliability
based on forecasted loads or current or expected system conditions. ISO
and the LCCs should attempt to mitigate this risk by repositioning or
recalling transmission outages that could impact transfer capability on
interfaces internal and external to ISO, restrict or isolate a Resource, or
impact energy security.
```
   o Identify and pursue cases where Resource and transmission outages could

```
be adjusted to reduce/eliminate Congestion Costs and overall outage
duration. In each case, LCCs will facilitate/coordinate outages as detailed in
Section VI.B.1 of this procedure to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion
Costs, or to achieve lesser congestion reduction if the TO(s) agree.

  - After LCC review, Submit Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outages to

ISO for further evaluation and coordination

  - Transmit ISO actions regarding outage requests to TOs

  - Perform dispatching functions for all Category B and Local Area Facilities if

Resource output is not affected by the outage, if assigned that responsibility by
its MPs

  - Promote a continuous flow of information between ISO and TOs to match

pending transmission outage work with Resource outages to the extent
practicable

  - Notify Market Participants (MPs) of potential limitations caused by transmission

outages

**NOTE**

Non-public transmission outage information and outage information associated

with other Resources shall not be shared with the Resource Owners contacted.

  - Refrain from engaging in multi-party communications simultaneously with

Resource and TOs unless the transmission outage of concern only affects one
Resource owner

**C. TO** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**

TOs or their designees shall:

  - Submit their proposed or updated transmission outage plans to their respective

LCC and provide as much information as possible on the flexibility of shifting the
requested period forward or backwards

  - Work with LCCs and ISO to provide alternate outage dates when it is determined

that congestion could be eliminated or reduced by doing so

  - Propose changes to any requested outage promptly after circumstances develop

and submit reasons for the change to the LCC


-----

  - When requested, submit information concerning the TO positioning of

transmission facility outages to ISO

  - Participating TOs will provide information regarding their direct costs for canceling

outages to their LCC and ISO when requested.

**NOTE**

The PTO staff working on transmission outages may be provided with Resource outage
information to assist in the establishment of outage plans and determining alternate
dates. The PTO staff working on transmission outages shall not disclose this
information to other parties.


-----

**IV. ROUTING TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**

The TO or MP requesting work on transmission facilities covered by OP-3 shall initially
submit a transmission outage request to the appropriate LCC. This section describes
the subsequent routing of transmission outage requests.

1. Facilities solely under the Jurisdiction of the LCC:

Category B Facilities not affecting Resource output and all Local Area
Transmission Facilities are under the jurisdiction of the LCC. The handling of
outages for these facilities is an LCC function. Transmission outage requests are
acted upon by the LCCs and need not be forwarded to ISO; however outages
involving Local Area Facilities affecting a Resource shall be processed using LCC
and ISO OP-5 scheduling practices. Outages involving Category B Facilities not
affecting a Resource shall be sent to ISO in a daily summary sheet.

2. Facilities requiring assessment by the LCC and ISO:

Unless the LCC denies the transmission outage request, the LCC shall review,
study and record assumptions and results for Category A and Category B
Facilities prior to forwarding to ISO for assessment.

3. Inter-LCC and Inter-Area Facilities:

Because of the special communication requirements that apply when
transmission outage requests involve Inter-LCC (i.e., facilities crossing LCC
boundaries but not leaving the New England RCA/BAA) and Inter-RCA/BAA
facilities, the LCC and ISO shall coordinate these transmission outage requests
as follows:

`o` **Inter-LCC facilities: The LCC shall forward transmission outage requests to**

the adjacent LCC and to ISO for approval or denial

`o` **Inter-RCA/BAA facilities - New York Independent System Operator**

**(NYISO) and New Brunswick Power System Operator (NBPSO): The LCC**
shall forward transmission outage requests to the appropriate adjacent system
dispatch agency and to ISO. ISO shall forward transmission outage requests
to the appropriate NPCC Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA)
for approval or denial

`o` **Inter-RCA/BAA facilities - TransEnergie: The LCC shall forward**

transmission outage requests to ISO. ISO shall perform all coordination with
TransEnergie. Transmission outage requests shall be forwarded to
TransEnergie for approval or denial

4. Transmission outage requests initiated outside the New England RCA/BAA

Transmission outage requests initiated by systems outside the New England
RCA/BAA for work on inter-RCA/BAA facilities will first be communicated from the
outside company to the involved LCC. If the LCC and outside company agree to
times and dates for an outage, the outside company will forward the transmission
outage request to its NPCC RC/BA who will assess the transmission outage
request and if approved, forward it to ISO for approval under Section V or VI.
ISO will notify the appropriate LCC


-----

5. Facilities on the NPCC Area Facilities for Notification List

In addition to inter-RCA/BAA facilities, there are other facilities in each NPCC
RCA/BAA that, if taken out-of-service, can affect adjacent RCAs/BAAs. These
facilities are listed in the document entitled, NPCC Directory #1 Design and
Operation of the Bulk Power System, Appendix F: Procedure for Operational
Planning Coordination, NPCC Facilities Notification List - Attachment D. ISO
shall forward transmission outage requests received from the LCCs, involving the
New England RCA/BAA facilities listed in NPCC Directory #1, Appendix F,
Attachment D, to the appropriate NPCC RCs/BAs for approval or disapproval.
Transmission outage requests received by ISO from adjacent NPCC RCAs/BAAs,
involving NPCC RCA/BAA facilities which can affect the New England RCA/BAA
transmission system, shall be reviewed by ISO for approval under Section V or VI
and reported to the appropriate LCCs.

**V. LONG-TERM TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**

**A. SCOPE** **OF** **LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REQUESTS**

Long-Term Transmission Outage requests shall include Category A Facilities and
Category B Facilities that affect Resource(s). The outage of any associated
equipment including but not limited to: breakers, disconnects, shunts, static VAr
compensators(SVCs), STATCOMs, series reactors or capacitors and phase shifting
transformers (PSTs) shall be reported.

Relays, reclosing and RAS or ACS outages shall be reported in accordance with ISO
New England Operating Procedure No.24 - Protection Outages, Settings and
Coordination (OP-24).

Unless cancelled, Interim Approved Long-Term Transmission Outages shall
automatically progress into the Short-Term Outage process, as described in Section
VI of this Procedure.

**B. MINIMUM** **ADVANCED** **NOTICE** **TIME-RESPONSE** **TIME** **FOR** **LONG-TERM**

**TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES**

In accordance with LCC procedures, TOs or their designees shall submit their
proposed or updated Long-Term Transmission Outages for all Category A Facilities
and Category B Facilities if a Resource output could be affected by the outage. The
LCCs or their designees shall submit the Long-Term Transmission Outage request in
the Preliminary status to ISO. ISO will not take any action to study or coordinate
outages with Preliminary status. Preliminary status shall be considered informational
only and will not set scheduling priority based on timestamp. Preliminary status shall
**not be accepted within twenty-one (21) days of the start date of the outage and any**
outages that were previously submitted and remain in Preliminary status shall be
automatically withdrawn at twenty-one (21) days prior to the start date. It is expected
that once the TO confirms these outage plans with the LCC, that the Long-Term
Transmission Outage request will be put into the Submitted status.

The LCCs shall provide Long-Term Transmission Outage requests in Submitted
status that have been studied, approved and provide appropriate documentation as
described in this procedure. This indicates to ISO that the Long-Term Transmission


-----

scheduling priority. Submitted Long-Term Transmission Outage requests shall be
accepted no sooner than twenty-four (24) months and no later than twenty-one (21)
days prior to the start date of the transmission outage.

ISO shall study Long-Term Transmission Outage requests in the Submitted status.
Prior to the ISO study, efforts to review and coordinate outages to reduce reliability
and economic impact shall be underway. Once the ISO study begins or until the
request is terminated, details of the Long-Term Transmission Outage request will be
locked from any changes initiated by the LCC. ISO may require cancellation and/or
a new submittal if significant changes are requested by the LCC. If further
information supporting the outage is required, ISO will place the outage in Negotiate.
Upon study completion, ISO shall apply a status of: Interim Approved or Denied and
respond to the appropriate LCC.

Long-Term Transmission Outage requests Submitted to ISO at least ninety (90) days
prior to the start of the outage, if approved through reliability studies, may also be
subjected to economic studies and possible repositioning. Facilities identified as
MTE may be subjected to economic studies and possible repositioning. The process
of Submitting Long-Term Transmission Outage requests involving an MTE facility at
least ninety (90) days prior to the start date of the outage does not ensure that it will
be Approved nor does it set any scheduling priority over any other previously
Submitted Long-Term Transmission Outage request. However, once such a request
is approved for economics, the applicant will have greater assurance that it will not
be cancelled at a later date due to economic impacts.

A Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to ISO at least twentyone (21) days prior to the start date of the outage and is approved for reliability will
receive Interim Approved Status.

A Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to the ISO at least
ninety (90) days prior to the start date of the outage, approved for reliability and
selected for economic study and ultimately approved, shall receive the flag LongTerm Economic Approval.

A Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to ISO less than ninety
(90) days prior to the start date of the outage and is given the status of Interim
Approved through the Long-Term Transmission Outage process may be subjected to
economic studies and possible repositioning in the Short-Term Transmission Outage
process. These Long-Term Transmission Outages will be at risk for cancellation for
economic impact up to the time the outage actually begins.

**C. LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REVIEW** **MORATORIUM**

1. Annual Forward Capacity Market (FCM) Reliability Review

a. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM annual

bilateral submittals for the upcoming FCM Capacity Commitment Period
(CCP); Long-Term Transmission Outage requests for outages that fall within
June 1[st] through September 15[th] of the FCM CCP will be time stamped to
establish review priority and held until the FCM bilateral reliability review
process is completed.


-----

(1) Annual Bilateral reliability review period begins immediately following the

close of the Annual Bilateral submittal period for the applicable FCM CCP.

b. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of the FCM 3[rd]

annual reconfiguration auction results for the applicable FCM CCP, Long-term
Transmission Outage requests for outages that fall within June 1[st] through
September 15[th] of the FCM CCP will be time-stamped to establish review
priority and held until the auction results reliability review is completed.

2. Monthly FCM Reliability Review

a. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM monthly

bilateral submittals and monthly reconfiguration auction results for the
applicable month, Long-Term Transmission Outage requests for outages that
fall within the applicable month will be time-stamped to establish review
priority and held until the reliability review process is completed.

**D. REPOSITIONING** **LONG-TERM** **OUTAGE** **REQUESTS**

ISO and LCCs, working with TOs, and Resources, shall reposition outages:

1) That could be expected to violate reliability criteria; or

2) To reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs.

ISO and LCCs, during their review, can reposition the facility outage of a TO if it
could be expected to violate reliability criteria. During their review, ISO and LCCs
can also reposition the facility outage of a PTO if it could be expected to achieve
Significantly Reduced Congestion Costs. Furthermore, an outage may be
repositioned to avoid net costs less than the $200K threshold if agreed to by the
involved TO(s).

ISO and the LCC, working with the PTO, will generally reschedule, within ninety (90)
days of the original schedule, any Long-Term Transmission Outage that requires
repositioning for reliability violations or to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion
Costs. In the event that the ninety (90)-day period falls between June 1[st] and
September 15[th], ISO and the LCCs will generally reschedule such a Long-Term
Transmission Outage during a period that begins no later than October 31[st].

TOs can propose changes to Long-Term Transmission Outage requests. The TO
must notify the applicable LCC promptly after circumstances develop that
necessitate such a change. The notification must include a description of the
circumstances that led to the change request. The LCC will promptly forward the
information to ISO. Changes to a Long-Term Transmission Outage request may
result in a requirement to submit a new request, sacrificing any scheduling priority
and shall be subject to ISO Market Monitoring review.


-----

**E. REPORTS** **-** **LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES** **PROJECTED** **OUT** **24**

**MONTHS**

ISO shall create and maintain a New England Long-Term Transmission Outage
Report and post the report daily on the ISO external website in accordance with the
ISO New England Information Policy. This report shall incorporate outages in the
following states: Preliminary, Submitted, Study, Negotiate and Interim Approved for
the time frame beginning twenty-four (24) months in advance of the current day and
ending within twenty-one (21) days of the current day.

**VI. SHORT-TERM TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**

**A. MINIMUM** **ADVANCE** **NOTICE** **TIME** **-** **RESPONSE** **TIME** **FOR** **SHORT-TERM**

**TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES**

Outages of transmission facilities may require extensive study and coordination, first
by the LCC to assess local area reliability and perform rudimentary congestion
analysis and then by ISO to assess bulk power system reliability and perform
warranted detailed congestion analysis. Operating policies at the LCCs define
minimum advance notice times for the submittal of Short-Term Transmission Outage
requests from the TOs to the LCCs. These notice times are critical and designed to
provide the LCCs with enough time to assess TO Short-Term Transmission Outage
requests before denying them or forwarding them to ISO for further analysis and
ultimate approval.

Similarly, ISO needs enough time to assess the Short-Term Transmission Outage
requests and deny or approve them. Furthermore, Approved outages must be
known in time for use in the settlement of the DAM, and TOs must know in time to
coordinate final steps to arrange equipment and manpower needed to do the work.
To provide adequate time for this analysis and coordination, application advance
notice times, and ISO response times, have been established.

Transmission Facilities

1. In general, all Category A Facility outages and Category B Facility outages that

affect a Resource shall require the submittal of a Short-Term Transmission
Outage application. LCCs and neighboring RCs/BAs shall submit Short-Term
Transmission Outage requests for these facilities to ISO at least one hundred and
twenty (120) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to begin (Example: An
outage positioned to begin at 0800 on Monday must be submitted to ISO before
0001 on Wednesday the week prior.) ISO shall approve/deny requests at least
twenty-four (24) hours prior to 0001 on the day the work is to begin. ISO shall
also have the authority to waive either of these timeframes.

2. To facilitate the submittal of Short-Term Transmission Outage requests for

specific transmission facilities, a detailed guide is provided in M/LCC 7. The
format of the guide goes by voltage level and the type of transmission facility,
which is a natural logic structure for considering transmission facilities. Minimum
advance notice times are given for each type of facility. These times reflect the
practical application of facility categories defined in this document.


-----

3. LCCs do not have to submit requests to ISO for outages involving Local Area

Facilities. However, outage requests for Local Area Facilities that affect a
Resource output shall be processed using LCC and OP-5 scheduling practices.

In general, complex outages, particularly those involving more than one LCC
and/or dispatch entities outside the New England RCA/BAA, will require
significantly longer coordination efforts. Consequently, discussions of these
outages by involved parties must begin several months early to coordinate the
system for the expected work. General information on these outages will first be
submitted by the TOs via the Long-Term Transmission Outage process. Details
on these outages shall be submitted to LCCs and in turn to ISO as soon as TOs
have finalized arrangements.

**B. SHORT-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REVIEW** **AND** **APPROVAL** **PROCESS**

LCC Review and Action:

1. Upon receipt of requests for work on Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities

that affect Resource output, the LCC shall perform the following:

a. Prior to submittal for ISO Short-Term Outage Request approval, the LCC shall

review all Scheduled Outages and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests
and compare them with Resource outage requests received from ISO.
Evaluate Short-Term Transmission Outage requests to assure reliable
operation. Deny any Short-Term Transmission Outage request that violates
any LCC operating procedure or is determined to be in violation of any ISO
OP or TOG.

b. Prior to submittal to ISO for Short-Term Outage Request approval, the LCC

shall, working with ISO, identify cases where Resource and transmission
outage positions could potentially be adjusted to achieve Significantly
Reduced Congestion Costs, or (with TO consent) where lesser congestion
reduction may be achieved. In each case, facilitate/coordinate repositioning
as follows:

(1) Discuss and assess the preliminary plan for outage repositioning with ISO

(2) Contact the TO for additional flexibility in their timing of the outage.

(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as
required)

(3) After consulting with the TO, if needed, proceed as follows depending on

whether the case involves;

i) an importing local area,

ii) a Resource or exporting local area involving a single owner

iii) an exporting local area involving multiple Resources owned by

multiple entities


-----

(a) Importing Local Area

For an importing local area, the simultaneous outage of transmission
supplying the local area along with Resource(s) within the local area
can increase congestion and, in severe cases, jeopardize system
reliability. To relieve this, the following actions will be taken to try to
position the transmission, and Resource outages so that they occur at
different times:

          - Contact the applicable Resource Owners to determine if the

outage may be repositioned

          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.

(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as
required.)

          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and the

Resource Owner until a determination is made by ISO on whether
or not activities may be repositioned to reduce/eliminate
congestion

**NOTE**

If actions above are not sufficient to relieve congestion, ISO will dispatch Resources in
accordance with the congestion management process or change the timing of the
transmission outage.

(b) Resource or Exporting Local Area Involving a Single Owner

This scenario involves a Short-Term Transmission Outage that will
restrict the commitment or dispatch of Resources owned by a single
entity (i.e., a line leaving a generating station). The following actions
will be taken as soon as possible to try to change or create outage
positions so that Resources and transmission outages occur
simultaneously, thereby relieving the potential locked-in Resources.

          - Contact the applicable Resource owner to determine if the outage

may be repositioned. If the Short-Term Transmission Outage
involves a radial circuit to a Resource, details about the
transmission outage can be shared with the Resource Owner.
Additionally, non-radial transmission outage information can be
shared with the Resource Owner if the Short-Term Transmission
Outage solely affects that Resource Owner

          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.

(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as
required.)

          - If required, continue to alternately contact the PTO and Resource

owner until a determination is made by ISO on whether or not
activities may be repositioned to reduce/eliminate congestion


-----

The PTO may contact the Resource Owner directly to facilitate

positioning of outages

(c) Exporting Local Area Involving multiple Resources owned by multiple

entities

This case involves a Short-Term Transmission Outage that will
restrict the commitment or dispatch of Resources within an exporting
local area that contains several units owned by different Resource
owners. The following actions will be taken to try to change or create
outage positions so that Resources outages and Short-Term
Transmission Outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the
potential locked-in Resource.

          - Contact the applicable Resource owners to determine if the

outage may be repositioned in the order that their outage request
was received

          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.

(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as
required.)

          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and Resource

owners until a determination is made by ISO on whether or not
activities can be positioned to reduce/eliminate congestion

          - If units with outage requests are exhausted or no outage requests

exist, contact affected Resource owners randomly, in a manner to
be determined by the LCC, without preference to any one
Resource owner. Inform each Resource owner that a Short-Term
Transmission Outage (no details) may result in their unit being
restricted and determine if they desire to coordinate an outage of
their unit with the Short-Term Transmission Outage

          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and Resource

owners until a determination is made on whether or not activities
may be repositioned to reduce/eliminate congestion costs

**NOTE**

If actions above do not alleviate constraints, ISO will dispatch Resources in the
constrained export area based on its congestion management process or change the
position of the transmission outage.

c. Once the Short-Term Transmission Outage has initial approval, either with or

without a corresponding Resource outage:

(1) notify adjacent LCCs and/or systems outside of the New England

RCA/BAA that may be affected by the requested work, and

(2) forward the application to ISO with the following information:

i) Facility (name and nomenclature).


-----

ii) Reason for application (work to be done).

iii) Emergency restoration time in hours.

iv) Time and date switching is to begin.

v) Time and date the facility is to be restored to normal operation.

vi) LCCs and/or systems outside of the New England RCA/BAA to

whom notifications have been given.

vii) Other information pertinent to the application that may affect ISO

decision, such as a request to revise a Resource outage schedule
to address congestion issues with the transmission outage.

viii) LCC analysis results and approval including contingencies and

limiting elements, local voltage constraints, must run Resources
and restricted Resources.

**NOTE**

Requests submitted by adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs must also be accompanied by
information listed in items i) through vii) above.

2. ISO Review and Reliability Study for Short-Term Transmission Outages:

Upon receipt of a request from an LCC for a Short-Term Transmission Outage,
ISO shall:

a. Assign the application an identification number.

b. Forward requests involving inter-RCA/BAA or NPCC Directory #1, Appendix F,

Attachment D facilities to the appropriate NPCC RC/BA for approval or denial.

c. Inform, as required, other LCCs or NPCC RCs/BAs.

d. Conduct reliability studies in sufficient detail to:

(1) Identify the more severe probable first contingencies (there may be

several).

(2) Identify voltage constraints and thermally limiting contingencies and

elements, expected flows on limiting elements, ratings [Normal, LongTerm Emergency (LTE), Short-Term Emergency (STE), Drastic Action
Limit (DAL)] of limiting elements and provide distribution and adjustment
factors. Determine if any pre-defined stability constraints must be
followed.

(3) Document system Resource patterns and transmission configurations

expected during the time work is to occur, i.e., Resources and
transmission facilities out-of-service, Resources required to be in-service,
etc.


-----

(4) Interchange schedules, flows across pre determined interfaces and/or

flows on major inter-RCA/BAA tie lines.

(5) Determine action required prior to beginning work and after work has

begun to ensure compliance with OP-19.

(6) Determine bulk power supply area protection Resource requirements

(units and energy availability).

(7) Determine ""locked in"" Resources. Include Resources that must be left

off-line, and on-line Resources that must be dispatched at reduced
loads.

e. When a conflict is identified, a Short-Term Transmission Outage request with

the Status of Submitted and Study should be repositioned before an Approved
or Interim Approved outage is repositioned. Outage priority is established in
Section VIII of this procedure.

f. With respect to routine transmission or Resource maintenance, in the event

that a Resource outage conflicts with a requested Short-Term Transmission
Outage, the Resource outage will normally have priority except in the seven
(7) days immediately preceding the start of the Short-Term Transmission
Outage in which case the outages will be prioritized according to the time at
which the outage request is received. ISO may adjust this priority due to
reliability concerns.

g. Obtain approval or denial from adjacent NPCC RC/BA, if applicable.

h. Approve or deny the request.

**C. NOTIFICATIONS**

When the review and assessment has been completed, ISO will communicate its
conclusions to the appropriate LCCs and/or adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs. ISO will notify
those LCCs and adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs that received preliminary notification of
the requested work, even if that notification was from an agency other than ISO. If a
Resource outage position or reduction was revised or initiated during processing of
the Short-Term Transmission Outage request (i.e., to eliminate congestion), ISO will
contact the Resource owner to confirm the revision to their position.

1. Notification in case of Approval

When approving a Short-Term Transmission Outage request, ISO shall provide
the conclusions of its reliability study in sufficient detail that all affected systems
recognize the impact of the approved work. The conclusions should cover at
least those items listed in Section VI.B.2.d.

2. Notification in case of Denial

When giving a Short-Term Transmission Outage request denial notification, ISO
shall state the reasons for denial. Those reasons shall be specific and relate to
items listed in Section VI.B.2.d or to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion
Costs.


-----

Once a Short Term Transmission Outage request for approval is denied, that
request is considered completed. To accomplish the work, a new request must
be submitted as described in Section VI.D.

3. Notification in case of Cancellation

An LCC or an adjacent NPCC RC/BA may subsequently cancel a Short-Term
Transmission Outage request for work on a New England RCA/BAA facility that
has been forwarded to ISO.

The party initiating such action shall determine and communicate to other
affected parties the specific reasons for the cancellation.

Once cancellation has been made, the Short-Term Transmission Outage request
is considered completed. ISO shall notify the appropriate LCCs and adjacent
NPCC RCs/BAs of the request status change. To accomplish the work, a new
request shall be submitted as described in Section VI.D.

4. Posting of Short-Term Transmission Outages

For transmission outages that are scheduled to occur from twenty (20) days up to
and including Real-Time, ISO shall post each transmission outage (other than
Cancelled, Withdrawn or Denied) on the ISO external website in accordance with
the ISO New England Information Policy. Any revision shall be updated on the
ISO external website in a timely manner.

**D. RE-SUBMITTAL**

To request approval of work that has been Denied or Cancelled, a new request with
a new request number and a new review and reliability study shall be processed as
though no previous request had been provided.

The one exception to this is when an ""Alternate Date"" has been supplied on the
original request form. The “Alternate Date” is the working day following the last date
for the outage. In the event the ""Alternate Date"" is used for repositioning the work,
the existing request will be used and all necessary review and study shall again be
processed for this work to be performed on the ""Alternate Date"".

**VII. UNPLANNED OUTAGES**

**A. SUBMISSION** **OF** **REQUESTS**

The following describes processes for providing requests (which will be processed
per Section VI of this procedure) for the three different types of Unplanned Outages.

1. **Emergency Outage**

MPs shall submit requests for Emergency Outages of transmission facilities
immediately to the LCC. If the request is for Category A Facilities or Category B
Facilities, the LCC shall immediately forward the request to ISO.


-----

2. **Forced Outage**

MPs shall notify their LCC as soon as the need for a Forced Outage is identified.
The LCC shall immediately notify ISO about the Forced Outage. The Forced
Outage should not be officially submitted until the LCC has reasonable
assurance from the MP that system conditions, crews and equipment are
available for the job.

3. **Overrun Outage**

MPs shall notify their LCC as soon as the need for an Overrun Outage is
identified and the LCC shall immediately communicate this information to ISO.

**B. RESPONSE** **TO** **UNPLANNED** **OUTAGES**

If time exists while crews, equipment, and/or corrective dispatch action arrangements
are being made, the LCC shall provide ISO with all pertinent information to allow for
study of the outage and prioritization with other dispatch requirements.

In either event, the flow of information regarding the Unplanned Outage shall follow
the outlines shown on OP-3 Attachments 1 through 9. The timing requirements and
various approval steps do not apply to most Unplanned Outages. Unplanned
Outages shall be subject to ISO Market Monitoring review.

**VIII. TRANSMISSION OUTAGE PRIORITY**

When a conflict arises with another transmission outage previously scheduled, ISO shall
attempt to resolve conflicting Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests
through discussions with the affected LCCs. When discussions cannot resolve the
conflict, the respective priorities of the outages shall be established according to the
types of outage and the outage status in the following order (highest to lowest priority):

1. Unplanned Outage (Emergency or Forced)

2. Long-Term Transmission Outage with Interim Approved Status and the Long
Term Economic Approval flag

3. Long-Term Transmission Outage with Interim Approved Status

4. Short-Term Outages

5. Opportunity Outage

If the above priorities do not resolve the conflict, the earliest requested transmission
outage shall have priority.

**IX. OUTAGE WORK REPORTS**

**A. LOCAL** **CONTROL** **CENTER** **TRANSMISSION** **WORK** **REPORT**

Daily by 1000, each LCC shall forward to ISO and, if appropriate, to the adjacent
LCCs a report that includes all equipment listed as Category B Facilities, which does
**not affect Resource output that is to be worked on during the following day** (The


-----

Sunday and Monday. Work on holidays shall be reported on the last regular
weekday before the holiday). The report shall include outage times when work is to
begin and end.

Following the Local Control Center Transmission Work Report, other reports from the
LCC to ISO and, if appropriate, to the adjacent LCCs shall include any additional
work outage for the following day and/or outage work during the following day that is
cancelled or postponed.

**B. REVIEW** **OF** **TRANSMISSION** **WORK**

Once work has been approved and Local Control Center Transmission Work Reports
have been completed, both ISO and the LCCs shall operate according to the
published outage application times. The party initiating the change shall
communicate any changes, for any reason. All affected parties shall be notified of
the change in work times.

On the night shift prior to the day the work is scheduled, ISO and the LCCs shall
discuss the day's upcoming work to ensure that all parties are up-to-date on work
times for switching and equipment work

Each LCC shall confirm final approval of the transmission outage application by ISO
Security Operator before switching begins. ISO shall be informed immediately when
equipment is taken out-of-service and/or restored to service.

**X. ANNUAL REPORT ON OUTAGE PROCESSING**

ISO, in coordination with the LCCs and PTOs, shall prepare and issue an annual report
on transmission outages and coordination. The report shall assess accuracy of inputs
and calculation of congestion cost savings. The long-term impacts of ISO, LCC and
PTO changes to outages shall be assessed and identify potential opportunities to further
minimize congestion costs identified.

**PART III - PROCEDURE**

**I.** **CRITERIA FOR REPAIR/MAINTENANCE (PRIORITY)**

The following criteria identify required response times to begin repair of failed
equipment. The times are based upon the importance of the equipment to
system operations. These same criteria are used to prioritize requests made for
equipment maintenance.

**A. Class A (immediate)**

This highest priority for repair or maintenance applies to equipment that is
critical to maintain adequate system security and reasonable economic
dispatch. The classification of immediate is assigned for critical equipment
that must be returned to service as soon as possible. It is expected that
these repairs or maintenance activities will be conducted continuously until
returned to service.

**B. Class B (regular working hours weekdays - except when they are more**

**than sixteen (16) hours removed)**

This intermediate priority is intended for the temporary loss of equipment that
can be tolerated for limited periods of time, but may not be tolerated for
prolonged periods of time.

**C. Class C (regular working hours)**

This is the preferred priority for the performance of all repairs and
maintenance. It applies to all equipment not covered in Part III.I. Sections A
or B.


-----

Suppo t qu p e t

**II.** **ESTABLISHMENT OF CRITERIA**

**A.** Under normal conditions, the criteria (priority classification) for maintenance

of various equipment affecting ISO operations is established in OP-2A.

**B.** Under either emergency or abnormal conditions, the ISO System Operators

and/or the LCC or SCADA Center System Operator(s) have the authority and
responsibility to change the criteria established in OP-2A. If any criterion is
changed, it shall be communicated to the ISO System Operators.

**III.** **RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIR/MAINTENANCE**

**A. Assignment of Repair/Maintenance Responsibility**

In most instances, the location of the equipment determines who has the
responsibility for repair or maintenance. Equipment located at a specific LCC
or SCADA Center is generally the responsibility of that Control Center.
Equipment located at ISO is an ISO responsibility. Repair or maintenance of
microwave or other communication facilities used in support of ISO operation
but not owned by ISO, shall be the responsibility of the owner.

**B. Repair Work**

An equipment failure shall be responded to within the time requirements
prescribed in Section I. Repair work status shall be communicated among all
affected parties.

**C. Coordination of Maintenance**

ISO shall coordinate all maintenance on equipment listed in OP-2A. This
includes the scheduling, approval or denial of requests for planned
maintenance, and the change in criteria classification in the event of an
emergency or abnormal condition. LCC and SCADA Center System
Operators also have the authority and responsibility to effect temporary
changes to the criteria established in OP-2A.

Reliability Standards: Development and Compliance
=================================================


ISO New England and other Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) are subject to a high level of regulation and enforceable standards on both federal and regional levels. Meeting those standards helps keep the power grid operating reliably for New England’s homes and businesses. Failing to meet those standards may mean that the ISO is not achieving its mission and can carry steep fines, as well. Standards are continually reviewed and updated, so the ISO monitors these developments closely to keep up to date with the changes, modify procedures and processes accordingly, and ensure ongoing compliance.

The ISO’s Funding and Budgeting Process
=======================================


ISO New England is a not\-for\-profit company that serves as the Regional Transmission Organization for New England. To fund the services we provide, we collect fees from the buyers and sellers in the region’s wholesale electricity markets and from the customers that use regional transmission services. Those service rates are set at a level that lets us recover only what we need to operate. And that amount is determined each year through the budget process described below.   




The Budget Development Process
------------------------------


The annual budget process gets underway well before the budget will take effect. Our commitment to cost accountability and transparency starts with judicious internal budget development. A robust external stakeholder review process follows. After the budgets are approved by our independent Board of Directors, we file our budgets with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which judges whether our collections are just and reasonable.

### Overview of Transmission Service in New England


As the Regional Transmission Organization, one of the ISO’s responsibilities is overseeing and coordinating transmission of electric power within, into, out of, or through the New England BAA. This is the collection of generation, transmission, and loads within metered boundaries spanning Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine (excluding the portions of Maine included within the Maritimes BAA). The transmission facilities within the New England BAA include [pool transmission facilities](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/ptf), non\-pool transmission facilities, merchant transmission facilities, and other transmission facilities.


Several types of transmission services are available in New England, including the following:


* **Regional Network Service (RNS)** to use the pool transmission facilities to move electricity into or within the New England BAA
* **Through or Out Service (T/Out)** to use the pool transmission facilities to move electricity out of or through the New England BAA
* **Local Transmission Service** to use the non\-pool transmission facilities to move electricity over a local network located within the New England BAA
* **CSC Transmission Service** to use the Cross\-Sound Cable (CSC) tie line to move electricity into, out of, or through the New England BAA
* **Phase I/II Transmission Service** to use the Phase I/II tie line to move electricity into, out of, or through the New England BAA
* **Generator Interconnection** to connect a generator to New England’s transmission system to be able to obtain service and move energy
* **Transmission Upgrades** to request an addition to, upgrade of, or modification of either the pool transmission facilities or the non\-pool transmission facilities

143," Maintaining Power System Reliability Amid Change
------------------------------------------------


Among [ISO New England’s responsibilities](https://www.iso-ne.com/about/what-we-do) as a Regional Transmission Organization is ensuring that the power system continues to operate reliably as conditions on the grid change. Ensuring the continued reliability of the transmission system requires a thorough review from numerous perspectives identified below, pursuant to Attachment K of the [Open Access Transmission Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff/oatt) (Section II of the ISO Tariff).



[### Reliability Transmission


Reliability Transmission ensures that system reliability criteria set by NERC, NPCC, and ISO New England are met. This includes assessments of transmission system reliability and solutions developed through the Solutions Study process or the competitive transmission process. Materials include study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/reliability-transmission)
[### Market Efficiency Transmission


Market Efficiency Transmission Upgrades (METUs) are upgrades identified by ISO New England to provide a net reduction in total production cost when the cost to supply system load exceeds the cost of the transmission upgrade. Evaluation criteria include study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/met)
[### Competitive Transmission


When Needs Assessments reveal a non\-time\-sensitive reliability need, or when Market Efficiency or Public Policy needs are identified, ISO\-NE conducts a Request For Proposal (RFP) process to find competitive solutions to solve these needs](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/competitive-transmission)
[### Public Policy Transmission


Transmission requirements to meet public policy goals are met through a competitive RFP process. Materials associated with this process include stakeholder input on public policy requirements, study scopes, presentations, reports, responses to written stakeholder comments, and any necessary modeling information](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/public-policy-transmission)
[### Longer\-Term Transmission Studies


NESCOE\-requested transmission studies performed to identify high\-level concepts of transmission infrastructure that could meet a New England state’s energy policy, mandate, or legal requirement based on state\-identified scenarios and timeframes, which may extend beyond the five\-to\-ten year planning horizon](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/longer-term-transmission-studies)
[### Proposed Plan Applications


View application forms, approval letters, and other materials related to proposed changes to the New England power system, including proposed new generators, changes to existing generators, transmission upgrades, and elective transmission upgrades](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/proposed-plan-applications)
[### Transmission Cost Allocation


Transmission Cost Allocation, or deciding whether the region pays for regulated (not merchant) transmission projects, is done through a collaborative and transparent process. Materials related to the cost review of regulated transmission additions, modifications, reconstructions, or replacements of pool transmission facilities that are eligible for regional cost support are available for review](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/transmission-cost-allocation)

144," ISO New England is providing this web guide to assist you in understanding the interconnection process for small and large generating facilities and elective transmission upgrades (ETUs) to interconnect to the administered transmission system. However, you shouldn’t rely solely on this web guide. Consult the *[ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff)* (ISO Tariff), Section II, known as the ISO’s *[Open Access Transmission Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff/oatt)* (OATT), and relevant [planning procedures](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/planning-procedures/) and [operating procedures](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/operating-procedures/) to ensure that you are complying with all requirements. In case of any discrepancy with this web guide, the ISO Tariff and applicable operating procedures and planning procedures govern.


Overview of the Interconnection Process
---------------------------------------


As a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), the ISO coordinates how transmission lines, power plants, and other resources connect to and operate on New England’s administered transmission system to ensure reliability and facilitate wholesale electricity market participation. The ISO does not administer the interconnection process for projects subject to state interconnection processes. Thus, [after you determine that the ISO interconnection process applies to your project](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/applications-status-changes/interconnection-process-guide/is-the-interconnection-process-right-for-you), you’ll need to submit an interconnection request to the ISO through the [Interconnection Request Tracking Tool](https://irtt.iso-ne.com/account/login) (IRTT). Existing customers can register for an account using [IRTT](https://irtt.iso-ne.com/account/login), while new customers must first or simultaneously obtain an ISO customer ID and access to critical energy infrastructure information.


As required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order No. 2023, it is only possible to submit interconnection requests during a cluster request window. The next window to submit a complete interconnection request package for the next Cluster Study is expected to be open from October 6, 2025 to November 20, 2025\. After the ISO validates your interconnection request and the cluster request window closes, the customer engagement window opens and a cluster study scoping meeting is held. A cluster study scoping meeting will address pertinent information about your project and the interconnection studies the ISO will perform to assess your project’s impact on the power system and the facilities and upgrades potentially needed to interconnect your project per all requirements and standards.


After the ISO has completed the necessary study work, you’ll work with the ISO and the transmission owner on an Interconnection Agreement (IA), a formal document detailing the terms and conditions for interconnection service. You must enter into an IA before you can construct or operate a generator or an elective transmission upgrade. Final steps of the interconnection process are to submit final data and register your asset with the ISO.

### I. Interconnection/Synchronization Checklist User Guide

 The purpose of this checklist is to provide the user a means to evaluate conditions between two islands prior to interconnecting/synchronizing - either inside New England herein to be referred to as an LCC-to-LCC synchronization, or between New England and another Reliability Coordinator Area referred to as an RCA-to-RCA synchronization. The worksheet is intended to complement the System Operator Rules of Thumb outlined in M/LCC 18 Attachment G - System Restoration Strategies. This allows the System Operators in both islands to document conditions on a common worksheet and to give a basic overview of each island for assessment before interconnecting/synchronizing.

  Row A: Identify whether you are pursuing an LCC-to-LCC or an RCA-to-RCA
 synchronization

  Row B: List the names of the islands under consideration for
 interconnection/synchronization. If the island does not have a predetermined name, establish and agree to a name based on island geographic and/or LCC location

  Row C: List the approximate load for each island to be interconnected/synchronized

  Row D: Perform a synchronous reserve assessment. List the generation on-line within
 each island and assess the capacity, energy, largest generation contingency and synchronous reserve within each island where:
```
      o Capacity = rated MW output
      o Energy = actual MW output
      o Largest contingency = largest single source of energy
      o Synchronous reserve = Amount of generation increase available within 10 minutes

 Compare results of both islands and determine if sufficient synchronous reserve exists

  Row E: Estimate the frequency excursions for both islands over the previous 30 minutes,
 which provide a condition of the relative stability of the island. If the frequency has been deemed unstable, System Operators may wish to hold off from interconnecting/synchronizing until island conditions stabilize

  Row F: Perform a synchronization assessment with regard to the criteria stated in
 M/LCC18G

  Row G: Identify the interconnection/synchronization location for the two islands

  Row H: Determine which island resource(s) will control frequency 

  Row I: Determine which entity will control tie-line flow 

  Row J: Determine which entity will coordinate the actual island
 interconnection/synchronization - typically the entity that has control of the

# 2. Purpose

This document describes the comprehensive “Operating Plan” of both ISO New England
(ISO) and the Local Control Centers (LCCs) to prepare for and mitigate Operating
Emergencies on the Bulk Electric System (BES) in the New England Reliability Control
Area (RCA). This Operating Plan is comprised of this procedure as well as the other
procedures identified herein. The purpose of this Operating Plan is to identify ISO and LCC
roles, responsibilities and processes to prepare for and mitigate Operating Emergencies.
The provisions of the Operating Plan also assist to meet certain requirements of North
American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, including the
following:

    - EOP-011 Emergency Operations

    - IRO-014 Coordination Among Reliability Coordinators

    - TOP-001 Transmission Operations

# 3. Introduction

**NOTE**

ISO, performing actions as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), Balancing Authority (BA) and
Transmission Operator (TOP) and the LCCs, performing actions as TOPs, implement the
procedures identified as part of the Operating Plan to prepare for and mitigate abnormal and
emergency system conditions. The term “Operating Emergency” as defined by ISO and the
LCCs in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 13 - ISO and LCC Communication
Practices (M/LCC 13) and as used in ISO and LCC procedures fully encompasses the
NERC terms “Emergency”, “BES Emergency”, “Capacity Emergency” and “Energy
Emergency” defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.

**NOTE**

Related implementing procedures, such as ISO Control Room Operating Procedures
(CROPs) and LCC-specific implementing procedures are not considered part of the
Operating Plan.

ISO and LCC responsibilities and actions listed in this Operating Plan are described at a
high level. The specifics of the actions are contained in the identified associated OPs and
M/LCC Procedures.

As detailed in Section 5.1, the following documents are considered part of the Operating
Plan to prepare for and mitigate Operating Emergencies:

    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency

(OP-4)

    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7)

# 5. Instructions

**5.1 ISO and LCC Preparation for and Mitigation of Operating Emergencies**

A. Actions to be taken by ISO and LCC System Operators to prepare for and mitigate

Operating Emergencies are described below.

_Energy Emergency Alerts_

1. ISO shall make a Reliability Coordinator Information System (RCIS) posting to
declare an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) whenever it takes the actions
described below:
```
      o EEA level 1 - when ISO implements OP-4 Action 2, or when ISO cancels all of

```
OP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10, and 11, one or more of which it had previously
implemented
```
      o EEA level 2 - when ISO implements OP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10 or 11 or when ISO

```
cancels OP-7 actions it had previously implemented
```
      o EEA level 3 - when OP-7 load shedding actions directed by ISO are imminent

```
or have been implemented
```
      o EEA level 0 - when ISO has declared an EEA level 1, and has taken both of

```
the following actions:

(1) when ISO cancels all of OP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10, and 11, one or more of

which it had previously implemented; and

(2) ISO also cancels OP-4 Action 2

2. During an EEA level 2, ISO shall:
```
      o Notify neighboring RCs/BAs and Designated Entities (DEs) and Demand

```
Designated Entities (DDEs) to communicate its needs
```
      o Update the energy deficiency information posted on the RCIS website as

```
changes occur and pass this information on to the neighboring RCs/BAs and
LCCs
```
      o Review transmission outages and work with the TOP(s) to determine if it is

```
possible to return to service any transmission elements that may relieve the
loading on System Operating Limits (SOLs) or Interconnection Reliability
Operating Limits (IROLs)

3. While in an EEA level 2, before declaring an EEA level 3, the ISO must have
made full use of all available Resources, including but not limited to:
```
      o All generation is on-line that is capable of being on-line in the time frame of the

```

||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|


Operating Emergency
```
    o Activation of all Demand-Side Management available in the time frame of the

```
Operating Emergency and within the provisions of applicable agreements

4. During an EEA level 3 ISO shall:
```
    o Continue to take all actions initiated during EEA level 2
    o Update the energy deficiency information posted on the RCIS website as

```
changes occur and pass this information on to the neighboring RCs/BAs and
LCCs
```
    o Evaluate the risks of revising SOLs and IROLs for the possibility of mitigating

```
the energy deficiency, in coordination with neighboring RC/BAs and with the
agreement of any LCC that has Transmission Owner (TO) equipment that
would be affected. System Operating Limits (SOLs) and Interconnection
Reliability Operating Limits (IROLs) shall only be revised as long as an EEA 3
condition exists, or as allowed by the TO whose equipment is at-risk.

5. During any EEA declared by another RC, ISO shall coordinate with the energy
deficient RC, as appropriate.

_Coordination Among Reliability Coordinators (RCs)_

6. If ISO and another RC disagree on the existence of an Operating Emergency that

potentially impacts one or both of them, ISO shall:
```
    o Operate as though the Operating Emergency exists
    o Develop an action plan to resolve the Operating Emergency, if ISO is the RC

```
that identifies the Operating Emergency in the ISO RCA
```
    o Implement the action plan developed by the RC that identifies the Operating

```
Emergency, unless such actions would violate safety, equipment, regulatory,
or statutory requirements

_ISO Assistance to LCCs and RCs_

7. ISO shall assist LCCs and RCs that are experiencing Operating Emergencies, if

requested and able, provided that the requesting entity has implemented its
emergency procedures, unless such assistance involves actions that cannot be
physically implemented or would violate safety, equipment, regulatory, or statutory
requirements.

_LCC Assistance to other LCCs_

8. Each LCC shall assist other LCCs that are experiencing Operating Emergencies, if

requested and able, provided that the requesting entity has implemented its
emergency procedures, unless such assistance involves actions that cannot be

For purposes of meeting NERC Standard EOP-011, ISO and each LCC maintain the
documents that are part of the Operating Plan by reviewing them as part of the normal
M/LCC Heads process for reviewing, updating and approving OP and M/LCC procedures.
As part of this process, ISO also adheres to SOP-RTMKTS.0210.0010 - Develop, Revise
& Control SOP, OP, M/LCC Documents. This process is how ISO and the LCCs address
applicable EOP-011 requirements for:

1. the LCC to submit an Operating Plan document to ISO;

2. ISO to review that Operating Plan document;

3. ISO and LCCs to address any reliability risks in the Operating Plan document; and

4. ISO to notify the LCC of the results of its review of the Operating Plan document.

All of these actions regarding an Operating Plan document (LCC submittal to ISO, ISO
review, ISO/LCC modification of document to address identified reliability risks and ISO
notification to LCCs of the results of its review) are all considered to occur on the same
day that the M/LCC Heads (ISO and the LCCs) conduct their final review and approval of
a given revision of the document

A. As part of its review of an Operating Plan document, ISO shall ensure that the various

responsibilities and identified actions of ISO and the LCCs identified in the Operating
Plan document are compatible and coordinated with other Operating Plan documents,
with consideration of inter-dependency of the various Operating Plan documents, so as
to avoid wide-area reliability risks.

B. ISO and each LCC shall work together to address any reliability risks identified by ISO

during such reviews, by modifying each appropriate Operating Plan document, as
necessary.

C. The ISO shall have the authority to modify Operating Procedures or develop new

Operating Procedures without such coordination or consultation when the ISO does not
have sufficient time to undertake such coordination or consultation due to emergent
and unanticipated circumstances.

D. The ISO shall have the authority, as the System Operator with ultimate authority for the

Real-Time operation of the New England Transmission System, to implement any new
Operating Procedures or modified Operating Procedures.

Master Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert
(M/LCC 2)

NPCC Document C-15 – Procedures for Geomagnetic Disturbances Which Affect
Electric Power Systems

**2.** **Purpose**

This document is the geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) Operating Plan of ISO New
England (ISO). This GMD Operating Plan describes, at a high level, activities
designed to mitigate the effects of GMD events on the reliable operation of the
interconnected transmission system within the ISO Reliability Coordinator Area
(RCA). A summary description of ISO actions and notifications is contained in
Attachment A - GMD Action Summary.

This document also specifies actions to be taken by the Local Control Centers
(LCCs) to mitigate the effects of GMD events and serves as the GMD Operating
Procedure for each LCC. A summary description of LCC actions is contained in
Attachment A - GMD Action Summary. This document reflects coordination of
actions to be taken by ISO and the LCCs to mitigate the effects of GMD events on
the ISO RCA.

**3.** **Introduction**

GMD events have the potential to adversely impact the reliable operation of the
ISO RCA. During a GMD event, geomagnetically-induced currents (GIC) may
cause transformer hot-spot heating or damage, loss of Reactive Power sources,
increased Reactive Power demand, and Protection System misoperation, the
combination of which may result in voltage collapse and blackout.

**4.** **Responsibilities**

1. ISO and the LCCs are each responsible for developing, maintaining and

implementing this procedure to mitigate the effects of GMD events on the
reliable operation of the ISO RCA.

2. As part of its normal periodic review of this procedure in coordination with the

LCCs, ISO is responsible for verifying that the ISO and LCC actions and
processes specified within are coordinated.

3. ISO is responsible for obtaining current and forecasted space weather

information and for disseminating it to entities identified as recipients in this

document, to facilitate coordination and consistent awareness of GMD events
within the ISO RCA.

4. Each LCC is responsible for receiving space weather information from ISO and

for taking actions specified in this document to address GMD events.

5. Any LCC that may have an associated implementing procedure (e.g.,

communication procedure, etc.) will keep such procedure consistent and not in
conflict with this procedure.

**5.** **Instructions**

**5.1 ISO Activities Designed to Mitigate Effect of GMD Events**

1. The following is a high-level list of the activities designed to mitigate the effects

of GMD events on the reliable operation of the ISO RCA.

    - Obtain information regarding current and forecasted space weather

pertaining to actual and expected GMD activity from various sources. Such
information is reflected in an assigned GMD intensity level index (ISO uses
the ""K"" index, where an index of 5 or 6 indicates a major GMD storm and an
index of 7 or greater indicates a severe GMD storm). The primary source
for this information is the Solar Terrestrial Dispatch (STD) Geomagnetic
Storm Mitigation System (GSMS). The STD GSMS software provides an
alert for forecasted and actual GMD events of K 6 or greater. For the
purposes of this procedure, a GMD event is an actual or expected GMD
storm that is assigned a ""K"" index of 6 or greater.

     - When ISO is notified of actual or expected GMD activity and that activity is

(or is forecast to be) a major GMD storm (“K” index is greater than or equal
to 6) or a severe GMD storm (i.e., when the “K” index is greater than or
equal to 7), review the GIC activity on the available monitors via SCADA.

     - When ISO is notified of actual or expected GMD activity and that activity is

(or is forecast to be) a severe GMD storm (i.e., when the “K” index is greater
than or equal to 7), notify entities of GMD space weather information,
including intensity (as reflected in the assigned “K” index), duration and
probability (for an Alert). In some cases this notification may include a
request that an entity take certain action(s). Such entities include:
```
     o LCCs
     o Designated Entities (DEs) and Demand Designated Entities (DDEs) for

```
New England Generators and Demand Resources

    - Document GMD events in the Control Room Event Logserver and the

Morning Report

    - Evaluate conflicting information received regarding a GMD event (if any) and

request clarification, as needed, to resolve any discrepancies

    - Evaluate current and forecasted operating information for possible action(s)

that may need to be taken to address a GMD event including
implementation of procedure M/LCC 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert

    - Take appropriate action(s) to address a GMD event, consulting with LCCs

as necessary

|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|
||Review Due Date: February 20, 2026|



    - Document the action(s) taken to address a GMD event

    - Determine when the GMD event is terminated

    - Notify entities of GMD event termination

**5.2 LCC Activities Designed to Mitigate Effect of GMD Events**

1. Receiving space weather information

    - LCCs receive GMD space weather information from ISO, including intensity

(as reflected in the assigned “K” index), duration and probability (for an
Alert) for severe GMD storms (forecasted and actual GMD events of K 7 or
greater)

2. LCC actions to be initiated based on predetermined conditions

A. Each LCC logs receipt of GMD space weather information from ISO

B. Each LCC consults and coordinates with ISO regarding actions that ISO

and/or the LCC(s) could take to address a GMD event. Such actions could
include, but not be limited to:
```
     o Discontinue maintenance and avoid taking lines out-of-service
     o Closely monitor voltage-related contingencies and maintain system

```
voltages
```
     o Monitor and dispatch Resources to manage system voltage

```
C. Each LCC takes local action to address unusual MVAr loadings and notifies

ISO of any unusual MVAr loading or voltage swings during a GMD event

D. Each LCC takes actions to address a GMD event as requested by ISO

E. Each LCC may take other actions to address a GMD event, as necessary to

preserve the reliability of the Bulk Electric System (BES) within their
respective LCC footprint and notify ISO of such actions

F. Each LCC logs actions that it takes to address a GMD Event

G. The LCC Operator notifies ISO whenever there is a > 20 amps GIC alarm

from available GIC monitoring points if SCADA data or ICCP is unavailable.

3. Conditions for terminating this procedure

    - The LCCs consider this procedure terminated when they receive notification

of the termination of the GMD event from ISO

1 Per NERC Operating Manual, August 2016; Electric System Restoration Reference Document-VI; Restoration of the Transmission System and System Loads (ESR-21 Approved:
April 1993; Updated: July 2003: “During restoration, the bulk power system should be operated so that reasonable voltage profiles (within the range 90% to 110% of nominal) can be
maintained. Where possible, voltages should be maintained at the minimum possible levels to reduce charging currents.”

2 These voltage criteria are “steady state” and are applied after the use of manual and automatic system adjustments on elements such as capacitors, reactors, load-tap changers and
dynamic reactive power output.

## I. 345 kV System Restoration Event Worksheet User Guide

The purpose of this worksheet is to provide the user a means to evaluate the transient overvoltage as well as the steady-state voltage effect of energizing 345 kV elements. While the
worksheet can be used for energizing all 345 kV lines, the primary application is for 345 kV
elements not identified in ISO New England Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18
– New England System Restoration Plan (M/LCC 18), Attachment A System Restoration
Flowchart (M/LCC18A). Even though the stated 345 kV elements in M/LCC18A have been
subject to Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) and steady-state evaluations, it is
recommended to use the worksheet to determine the cumulative effect on reactive margins
while energizing 345 kV transmission elements since Real-Time system conditions may
significantly differ from study assumptions.

Attachment G columns can be broken into four main sections:

   - Task description - what line is being energized and when

  - Resource information - Columns 1 and 2

   - Energization information - Columns 3 through 5

   - Decision to energize - Columns 6 and 7

ISO New England Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System
Restoration Plan (M/LCC18) Attachment G - System Restoration Strategies (M/LCC18G),
this document, provides for the decision to energize to be determined as a result of
comparing reactive Resources to energization information. This is an arithmetic analysis
only; it is strongly recommended that System Operators confer with their respective
engineering support group prior to energizing alternate paths, that are not identified in
M/LCC18A, during system restoration.

Energization of a 345 kV element that is performed outside of the studied paths should be
evaluated, by ISO and the applicable LCC(s) System Operator/s, using M/LCC18G.

The worksheet is filled out sequentially and values are cumulative; only columns that are
applicable will contain information.

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


**NOTE**

As a result of electromagnetic transient studies using the EMTP analysis software, a
“thumb-rule” of 150 MVA of dynamic reactive Resources (i.e., spinning generation or
synchronous condensers) has been determined to provide sufficient transient dynamic
reactive capability to maintain acceptable transient over-voltage during 345 kV element
energizations that are not specified in M/LCC18 A. However, since a Generator MVA
rating value is typically found on the Generator nameplate data sheet and is not readily
available to System Operators during a system restoration event, a Generator MW rating
value will be used in lieu of MVA rating value. Typically a Generator is rated in terms of
maximum MVA output at a specific voltage and power factor (usually 0.85 to 0.9 lagging).
For example, a 150 MVA rated Generator with a 0.9 lagging power factor will have a 135
MW rating (150 MVA * 0.9). Therefore using 150 MW of on-line Generator capability will,
generally, exceed the 150 MVA of on-line capability and will result in a more acceptable
transient over-voltage performance.

The term electrically close (or “near”) is used when dealing with an island with multiple
Resources that are not at the same electrical interconnection point. When there are
multiple Resources available within an island for consideration in energizing a 345 kV
line, the electrically closest Resources in the island should be used when determining if
the 150 MW requirement is met.

Starting a synchronous condenser can cause a short, large voltage depression and the
engineering support group should be consulted prior to energization.

For the purposes of these calculations, synchronous condenser MW equals the
synchronous condenser MVA rating.

A. Column 1 is to determine that sufficient transient dynamic reactive capability exists to

maintain acceptable transient over-voltages during the 345 kV element energization.
The user must enter “Y” if the total MW capability of all on-line Resources is more
than 150 MW or enter “N” if the total MW capability of all on-line Resources is less
than 150 MW. If “N” then energization is not permitted using this worksheet and
either:

1) More Resource capacity should be brought on-line or;

2) Detailed engineering studies should be performed to determine whether

energization can occur.

B. Columns 2 through 6 require the user to enter the appropriate information and

perform the indicated mathematical function.

1) Column 2 identifies the available Resource Lead MVAR absorbing capability that

is “near” the 345 kV energization. This value translates as the total MVAR
absorbing capability. The term “near” is used to indicate that the electrical
proximity of the available Resource to the point of energization is critical and
should be considered prior to the 345 kV element energization. System

Operators are advised to work with engineering staff to determine whether the
available Resources are electrically close to (or “near”) the 345 kV energization.
One variable to determine if a Resource is “near” the 345 kV element under
consideration is the Resource’s ability to control voltage at the point of
energization.

2) Column 3 identifies the expected charging of the 345 kV element being evaluated.

The charging value at NOMINAL voltage can be obtained from ISO New England
Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System
Restoration Plan (M/LCC18) Attachment C Charging of 345 kV Circuits in New
England (M/LCC18C).

3) Column 4 identifies Reactor MVAR, if any, that will be energized simultaneously

with the transmission element being evaluated. If no reactors will be energized
with the element, this value will remain zero (0).

4) Column 5 is the Net MVAR charging from the 345 kV transmission element being

energized. This value is the difference of Columns 3 and 4. The value in this
column will be entered on the right side of the comparison equation in Column 6
as the “Net MVAR Charging”.

C. Column 6 is used to determine that sufficient leading capability exists to absorb all the

MVAR Charging from the element to be energized and maintain acceptable steady
state voltages.

1) Column 6 is the difference between the available Resource Lead MVAR capability

(column 2) and Net MVAR Charging (column 5).

**NOTE**

Energizing 345 kV cables should not be attempted until later stages of system
restoration. Rules of Thumb will not be used for cable energizations. Cable energizations
will be completed through engineering evaluation.

D. Column 7 requires that the answers in column 6 are greater than zero in order for the

decision to energize to be “Y”. System Operators should consider taking both of the
following actions prior to energizing 345 kV lines:

1) Maintain Resource* voltages at nominal/minimal levels, and

2) Create leading reactive reserve on Resources* by using loads and available

reactors to absorb reactive power.

*** Resources referred to above are those Resources considered in order to**

satisfy the inertia requirement (minimum 150 MW of generation capability) for
energizing 345 kV elements.

## II. Restoration Strategy Rules of Thumb

**A. Generation Restoration**

1.Frequency Control

a. Monitor appropriate frequency for the island being controlled

b. Maintain steady-state frequency 59.9-61.0 Hz

2.Generation Loading

a. When possible, maintain minimum loading on each Generator to prevent loss of any

Generator, creating significant frequency excursion

b. Increasing island inertia is beneficial to stable operation. Energizing additional

transmission elements, load, and generation will increase the island size and
generation MW reserve in the island. These actions improve the likelihood an island
will ride-through a frequency excursion caused by a system disturbance.

3.Load Shed

a. 6-10% of load shed in area produces ~1 Hz rise in frequency

4.Regulation

a. Flat Frequency- New England is isolated or larger of interconnected areas

(automatically changes AGC Bias to lower value)

b. Tie-Line Bias- New England is smaller of interconnected areas

c. Use multiple slower-moving Generators vs faster-moving to prevent frequency

hunting

**B. Load Restoration**

1. Load Pick Up

a. Until operational experience shows otherwise, loads based on normal operating

values for time, date and season should be restored in block sizes that do not
exceed 5% of total synchronized generating capability

b. When any Generator operating with the governor in isochronous (isolated, island)

mode is operating in an island which also contains significant generation with the
governors operating in droop (parallel, manual) mode:

i. Monitor the isochronous unit loading as new load is energized and as cold
load decreases.

            - Ensure no overload of the isochronous unit occurs before transferring

some of its load to a droop unit with available capacity.

            - Ensure cold load reduction does not threaten to trip the isochronous

unit on reverse power.

2. Frequency Control

a. Increase frequency to 60.3-61.2 Hz prior to load pick-up

3. Cold Load

a. Cold load remains at 150-500% of normal load for up to 30 minutes

**C. Transmission Restoration**

1. Voltage Control

a. If operationally allowed, maintain steady-state voltage +/- 5% of nominal (ideally low in the

voltage range)

NOTE

Cables will not be energized using Rules of Thumb. Cable energizations will be evaluated
by support engineering prior to energization.

2. Charging

a. 345 kV Overhead- 0.88 MVAR/Mile

b. 230 kV Overhead- 0.28 MVAR/Mile

c. 115 kV Overhead- 0.07 MVAR/Mile

3. Minimum Source (Overhead)

a. Resources electrically close to 345 kV energization (generally 150 MW, use energization

worksheet)

b. 115 kV/230 kV ensure on-line Resources have sufficient dynamic reactive reserve (AVRs

in Automatic)

**D. Island Interconnections**

1. Parameters to Check Prior to Interconnection

a. Determine the largest single contingency loss

b. Assess if Operating Reserves are adequate to cover the loss

c. Determine the amount of spinning reserve

d. Assess if a load shedding plan will be used for reserve

e. Determine if any transmission facilities overload if reserves are activated

f. Determine if either of the largest contingencies in the two islands occurs after the
combined island is formed, that the interconnection circuit(s) will be able to

accommodate the resultant power flows within their rating(s)

2. Synchronization Parameters

a. Interconnect at substation with synchroscope

b. If possible, at substation close to Resource to control phase angle and voltage

c. Voltage difference <3%

d. Frequency difference <0.05 Hz (<1 synchroscope rotation in 18 seconds)

e. If possible, synchronize with a breaker equipped with sync-check relay functionality.

3. Resource Contingencies

a. Increase in tie-line flow = {(the MW size of the Resource contingency) times (the

MW size of the system on the non-contingent side of the tie-line)} divided by {the
MW size of the combined synchronized system}

Contingent Resource[MW] X non-Contingent side Load[MW]

Increase in tie-line flow =

Total Synchronized Load[MW]

### Table 1 - Charging of 345 kV Circuits in New England

**NOTE**

All MVAr values are at nominal voltage.

A circuit # followed by an asterisk (*) indicates a 345 kV cable that has one (1) or
more reactors simultaneously switched upon cable energization; MVAr charging
values listed indicates gross/net charging to account for reactor compensation.
These are calculated values only and they do not account for additional reactive
Resources available to further compensate cable charging.

**NOTE**

All Lines that terminate in more than 1 Local Control Center (LCC) or Reliability
Coordinator Area (RCA) jurisdiction are listed in each LCC and are bolded. The
jurisdictional LCC or RC for the remote terminal is listed after the terminal name.

**NOTE****

The 349 Line [Sections 4 and 5 with circuit #s followed by a double asterisk (**)]
overhead segment between Wakefield Junction and Golden Hills (NGRID) cannot
be in-service without the Golden Hills - Mystic 349 XY (or 349X or 349Y)
underground cable segment(s) (NGRID – NSTAR) also being in-service.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

This document, Master /Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System
Restoration Plan (M/LCC 18) and the M/LCC 18 Attachments include strategies,
guidelines, information and instructions that are to be used by ISO New England (ISO)
and the Local Control Centers (LCCs) during implementation of the New England
System Restoration Plan (the Plan) after a partial or total shutdown of the New England
Bulk Electric System (BES), which generally consists of facilities operated at voltages
of 100 kV or higher. The Plan (as represented in its entirety by M/LCC 18 as well as all
M/LCC18 Attachments) is the single New England regional system restoration plan that
serves as both:

   - the Transmission Operator (TOP) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-005) and

   - the Reliability Coordinator (RC) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-006).

**NOTE**

These same M/LCC 18 documents also serve as the TOP restoration plan

for each Local Control Center (LCC).

Expeditious system restoration of the BES depends on independent actions and interactions
by ISO, LCCs and Market Participants (MPs). The expanse of the blackout (locally limited
or regionally widespread) will determine the response by ISO, each LCC and each MP,
including the procedures and/or instructions which may need to be implemented.

The major objectives of the Plan are to:

1) Provide off-site ac power to the New England nuclear power stations

2) Interconnect all New England Transmission Operators (TOPs) (i.e., the LCCs)

3) Establish interconnections/synchronizations with contiguous Reliability Coordinator

Areas (RCAs) that are normally synchronously connected to the New England RCA,
advancing system restoration of the Eastern Interconnection

When these three objectives have been achieved and, in accordance with EOP-005, the
choice of the next load to be restored is not driven by the need to control frequency or
voltage, implementation of the Plan shall be considered to have been completed. ISO
recognizes that, upon completion of the Plan, LCC local recovery actions may still be
ongoing for the energization of remaining New England load. The local area recovery
actions of each LCC are documented in their respective Local Area Recovery Instructions
(LARIs), which are not part of the Plan. As necessary, ISO will continue to coordinate with
each LCC when restoring load to remaining areas of New England, while each LCC

implements its respective LARIs.[1]

Recognizing the numerous possible system blackout scenarios (depending on the expanse
of the blackout, Resources available for system restoration, etc.), knowledge and application
of the guidelines, information and instructions contained in this document and related
Attachments are critically important. This procedure provides for coordinated actions of ISO
and other entities identified in the Plan (including each LCC, TOPs, Transmission Owners
(TOs) and MPs). Coordination is especially important with respect to the technical aspects
of system restoration (i.e., Generator startups, load pickups, switching surges, voltages,
frequency, synchronization of islands, etc.). ISO shall work with its affected LCCs and
Generator Operators (GOPs), as well as neighboring RCAs, to monitor system restoration
progress, coordinate system restoration, and take actions to restore the BES frequency
within acceptable operating limits. ISO shall coordinate and authorize re-synchronizing
islanded areas that bridge boundaries between the LCCs or between the ISO RCA and
neighboring RCAs.

The ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (Tariff) provides for
ISO to enter into contractual arrangements with blackstart Generators that have the ability to
be started without support from the transmission system. Blackstart Generators are an
essential element of the Plan. The M/LCC18 suite of documents contains a full listing of all
of the Designated Blackstart Resources (DBRs) in the Plan, including Primary Path DBRs
(referenced in M/LCC 18 Attachment A) and Alternate Path DBRs (referenced in M/LCC 18
Attachments H and K). All DBRs in the Plan are considered material to the Plan and are
listed in confidential document, M/LCC 18, Attachment O - Designated Blackstart
Resources. Attachment O also includes a listing of other additional DBRs that are not part
of the Plan but can be called upon, as needed, to support the system restoration strategies
of the Plan.

**A. Responsibilities**

ISO and LCC responsibilities regarding Plan implementation are specified in this M/LCC
18 as well as in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1 Central Dispatch Operating
Responsibilities and Authority, Appendix A, Assignment of Responsibilities (OP-1A).
Responsibilities of MPs and TOs regarding Plan implementation are specified in OP-1A.
This Section of the procedure provides an outline of the responsibilities of ISO and each
LCC (including independent actions and interactions between these entities). Each LCC
relationship to ISO is the same; therefore, each LCC’s general responsibilities during
system restoration are the same

1. ISO Responsibilities

1 Energizations of Defense Critical Electric Infrastructure (DCEI) facilities is a top priority for Transmission Owners (TOs) and the

TO should align recovery of these facilities with the restoration of load to support the Plan objectives. Restoration of DCEI facilities
should not conflict with the Plan objectives. When possible, DCEI facilities should be excluded from under-frequency load shed
plans. If unable to be excluded, DCEI facilities should be assigned the lowest priority for load shed.

k. Prioritizing activities during system restoration that contribute to the completion of

the Plan such that each LCC implementation of their LARI documents, which are
not part of the Plan and which are considered secondary to the primary priority of
performing the required functions, are meeting the stated objectives detailed in
the Plan

**B. Plan Implementation Criteria and System Assessment**

The ISO Operations Shift Supervisor shall determine whether to implement M/LCC 18 if
one or more of the following events occurs:

   - A system disturbance results in a partial or complete blackout in which one or

more areas of the New England BES shuts down and the use of DBRs is required
to re-energize the shutdown area(s) of the New England BES

  - Separation has occurred between the ISO RCA and one or more neighboring

RCA(s) and the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor determines that implementation
of the Plan is necessary to interconnect/synchronize with the RCA(s)

  - An energized island has been formed on the BES within the New England RCA

and the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor determines that implementation of the
Plan is necessary to resynchronize that island with the remainder of the ISO RCA

If M/LCC 18 is implemented, the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor shall:

  - Make an entry in the Control Room Event Logserver.

   - Post a “Notice” to the ISO external website.

**NOTE**

M/LCC 18 Attachment Q - System Restoration Checklist (Confidential) is expected to be
used by the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor and by the LCC System Operators during
the stages of System Restoration.

  - Following a complete or partial Blackout, use M/LCC 18 Attachment Q during the

stages of System Restoration.

If M/LCC 18 is implemented, each LCC shall create a log entry to document this.

The ISO Restoration Coordinator and each applicable LCC restoration coordinator shall
conduct a post-blackout-event system assessment. Based on this assessment, the ISO
Restoration Coordinator shall determine the priority assigned to actions taken to achieve
Plan objectives. The ISO Restoration Coordinator, in conjunction with the applicable
LCC restoration coordinator(s), will coordinate the use of identified Plan Resources.

**NOTE**

Recognizing the nuclear power stations sensitivity to Coping Time during a complete
loss of ac power, when both a Primary and Alternate Path are out-of-service at the same
time, a Temporary Plan is required when the M/LCC 7 Processing Outage Applications
(M/LCC 7) criteria cannot be met. Temporary plans do not apply to paths for inter- or
intra-area synchronization points. These paths are addressed by system restoration
strategies (M/LCC 18 Attachment G).

The System Restoration paths detailed in Attachment A - System Restoration Flowchart,
achieve all Plan objectives. As listed below, Primary Paths only include paths from
identified DBRs to nuclear power stations.

Primary Paths LCC(s) Involved

Stony Brook to Millstone CONVEX

Westbrook to Seabrook Maine, NH

In the event that the Primary Paths cannot be followed or if sufficient Resources are
available to support multiple Plan objectives concurrently, Alternate Paths are detailed in
Attachments H and K. Alternate Paths include paths from alternate source DBRs to
nuclear power stations.

Alternate Paths LCC(s) Involved

Millstone Alternate Path (Attachment H) CONVEX

Seabrook Alternate Path (Attachment K) NH

In addition, other system restoration paths can be evaluated and pursued using the
system restoration strategies detailed in the Plan (including the use of Attachment G –
System Restoration Strategies). ISO and the applicable LCCs shall use system
restoration strategies to facilitate system restoration if the Plan cannot be executed as
expected.

In addition to Plan documents, ISO and LCC restoration coordinators and System
Operators should also refer to any Temporary Guides applicable to Plan implementation,
such as those that may have been developed to address non-permanent outages of
Plan facilities.

**C. Potential Actions to Stabilize Remaining Electrical Island(s)**

During a blackout event, electrical islands internal to New England may remain
energized as New England separates from the Eastern Interconnection. It is imperative

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


to immediately monitor and assess conditions within these islands and take any
warranted actions, including shedding load or shutting down Resources, to stabilize their
operations. Actions taken at LCC or Local Dispatch Centers to secure voltage, thermal
or frequency conditions may include the switching of reactive devices, Resource
dispatch actions, transmission switching or load shedding. As a guide, per the NERC
Restoration Reference Document, shedding approximately six to ten percent (6-10%) of
the load in the island will restore frequency in that island by 1 Hertz[3].

The ISO System Operators may need to suspend use of Electronic Dispatch orders and
change to manual dispatch orders. Also, depending on the status of the tie-lines
between RCAs or BAAs, ISO System Operators should appropriately select flat
frequency or tie-line bias control to stabilize frequency. If the New England power
system is electrically isolated, the flat frequency control mode should be implemented. If
still synchronously tied to one or more BAAs, combinations of different control modes
may have to be explored. Tie-line bias control should be selected if ISO is the smaller of
the RCAs interconnected. If ISO is the larger of the synchronously connected RCAs, flat
frequency control should be selected.

When flat frequency operation is used, the normal bias setting (approximately 1% of
forecasted peak load) may be changed to a reduced value that approximates the
expected actual frequency response of the remaining island. This reduced bias setting
should minimize system frequency oscillations by preventing excessive Regulation
change signals to Resources during islanding. Slower moving Regulation Resources
should also be selected to prevent significant frequency excursions.

**D. Avoiding Unplanned Connections of Electrical Islands**

Circuit breakers of transmission circuits that opened during the blackout event, and
whose terminals are energized within separate electrical islands, may automatically
reclose. This action can be performed by automatic synchronism-check relays that were
installed to supervise the steady-state angles across, and appropriate re-closure of, an
open circuit whose terminals are synchronized during normal system conditions. The
unintentional reclosing of two disconnected systems whose frequencies and voltages
happen to match for a sufficient period of time, may be followed either by the trip of the
circuit as the islands continue to pull away from each other or the de-energization of one
or more of the recently connected islands. Also, there is a risk that circuits between
electrical islands may be inadvertently closed during switching for system restoration.

To avoid unplanned connections between electrical islands, switching procedures
should:

    - Contain steps such as inhibiting reclosing relays via Supervisory Control And

Data Acquisition (SCADA) commands or the opening of disconnects on circuits
that comprise a split between electrical islands

    - Call for the notification of field personnel to alert them to events involving

electrical islanding and increase awareness to the possible need for
synchronizations before manual closures of breakers.

**E. Restoration of Off-Site ac Power to Nuclear Power Stations**

One of the most critical power requirements after a blackout is the assurance of reliable
shutdown of nuclear Generators. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires
that these Generators have reliable on-site power sources (Emergency Generators) for
shutdown operations. The expeditious restoration of alternative off-site ac power
sources to nuclear power stations is imperative to promote the continued reliability of
shutdown operations.

It is of the utmost importance during system assessment after a blackout to determine
the status of the Emergency Generators at nuclear power stations in New England. The
ISO Restoration Coordinator shall use this information to prioritize coordinated system
restoration activities.

The Plan documents the Primary and Alternate paths for restoring off-site ac power to
nuclear power stations, stressing the urgency to restore off-site power to nuclear
Generators that have lost all off-site and on-site ac power. The agreements pertaining to
how the off-site power requirements of nuclear power stations are fulfilled during System
Restoration, including priority of system restoration, are contained in Master/Local
Control Center Procedure No.1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) and
the following M/LCC 1 Attachments:

Attachment C - Millstone Nuclear Power Station (Confidential) (M/LCC 1C)

Attachment D - Seabrook Nuclear Power Station (Confidential) (M/LCC 1D)

The loss of all off-site and on-site ac power at a nuclear power station is defined as a
Station Blackout (SBO). Each nuclear Generator can maintain adequate core cooling
without significant damage for the minimum SBO coping time listed in M/LCC 1 Attachment C and D for the applicable nuclear power station. ISO and each applicable
LCC shall be mindful of the amount of time that the New England nuclear Generators
can maintain adequate core cooling during an SBO event and shall reassess system
restoration priorities to take into consideration the requirements and urgency of the
nuclear power station that is experiencing an SBO event.

Nuclear power stations are notified when a stable power system is established following
a system restoration. This notification enables the nuclear power station to switch from
the emergency on-site power sources back to the New England transmission system for

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


continued reliability of shutdown operations.

**F. Opening Circuit Breakers and Switches**

In most cases, in-place substation procedures provide specific switching instructions to
be followed in the event of a substation blackout. Some substations have equipment
which automatically switches into a desired post-blackout configuration.

In general, capacitors and customer loads will be opened and disconnected from the
345/230/115 kV transmission system. Similarly, circuit breakers or switches on the
345/230/115 kV transmission system will be opened. On the 345 and 230 kV, stepdown transformers will be opened on the high side to avoid the simultaneous
energization of a 345 or 230 kV circuit along with a step-down transformer. Step-down
transformers off the 115 kV system will be opened on either the high or low side.

Operators should have station and distribution capacitors opened in locations where
customer load can effectively absorb charging from transmission lines. This will help
prevent high voltage conditions on the transmission system and excessive underexcitation on Generators. Along these lines, operators should anticipate the use of any
available reactors to help absorb charging and prevent high voltage.

**G. Reviewing Load Tap Changer (LTC) Positions**

During system collapse, LTCs on autotransformers could move toward/to extreme tap
positions in an attempt to maintain sub-transmission or distribution voltage. Upon
collapse, the LTCs would remain in these positions and subsequent re-energization of
the autotransformers could result in excessively high or low voltages that could result in
equipment or load damage. Consequently, LTC positions should be checked prior to
energization of autotransformers. If LTC positions are substantially off nominal, taps
should be moved to nominal positions before energizing autotransformers.

**H. Generator Start Ups and MW Loadings**

Generator MW loadings will be primarily dictated by minimum MW loading requirements
to ensure Generator stability and the need to provide station service power to
Generators without blackstart capability. ISO and LCC System Operators should
balance restoring generation and load to restore the transmission system and meet the
goals of the Plan with the added coordination and stability requirements of excessive online generation. As larger Generators are started, they will provide stronger sources of
synchronized inertia and minimize excursions of frequency and voltage.

Stronger sources will facilitate circuit energizations, the provision of spinning reserve,
and load pickups (including larger block sizes of load pickups).

ISO and LCC System Operators should provide on-line Generators with their minimum
loading requirements. System Operators should also restore as much of the next

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


cranked Generator’s minimum loading as possible prior to starting the next cranked
Generator. This load should be transferred by adjusting Generator loadings in the
synchronized subsystem. This method of providing minimum load requirements to
Generators is preferable to performing load pickups after a Generator has been
synchronized and is not yet stable at its minimum loading.

Generator loadings should be minimized to prevent severe frequency excursions, or loss
of the island, in the event of a Generator trip. Increasing island inertia is beneficial to
stable operation. Energizing additional transmission elements, load, and generation will
increase the island size and generation MW reserve in the island. These actions improve
the likelihood an island will ride-through a frequency excursion caused by a system
disturbance.

The ISO Restoration Coordinator shall determine the point during system restoration at
which ISO will resume normal generation dispatch control, based on the following
considerations:

   - number of LCCs interconnected

   - amount of synchronized reserve

   - amount of transmission and load restored

   - status of telecommunication and operating tools

**I. Wind Plants and Solar Plants**

Wind plants and solar plants have variable outputs that are a function of wind speed or
irradiance, respectively. The variability of these outputs can be problematic during a
system restoration, particularly when trying to stabilize or synchronize islands.

The following guidelines should be applied for both wind plants and solar plants during a
system restoration:

   - In electrical islands:
```
    o Disconnect wind plants and solar plants if their varying outputs cause

```
unacceptable voltage or frequency deviations.

`o Disconnecting all wind plants and solar plants at once may cause the island` to

collapse if their output exceeds 5% of the island’s generation capacity
```
    o Disconnect wind plants and solar plants in banks. Compensate with other

```
generation or load shedding to maintain frequency.

   - In blacked-out areas:

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|

```
    o Ensure wind plants and solar plants are disconnected and leave them out-of
```
service until the latter stages of system restoration.

**J. Spinning Reserves**

During initial stages of system restoration, few Generators are on-line and System
Operators may not be able to provide spinning reserves. As system restoration
progresses and more Generators are phased in, System Operators should establish and
maintain enough spinning reserve as soon as possible to cover loss of the Generator
generating the most MW. Eventually, spinning reserves should be adequate to cover
loss of the largest generating Generator and have additional reserve for continuing
Generator start-up demands.

**K. Load Pickups**

**_1. Load Block Sizes_**

Load restoration will require careful coordination to ensure that Generator governors
are not overtaxed and do not overspeed or underspeed during load pickups.

     - Until operational experience shows otherwise, loads based on normal

operating values for time, date and season should be restored in block sizes
that do not exceed 5% of total synchronized generating capability.

     - When any Generator is operating with the governor in isochronous (isolated,

island) mode in an island which also contains significant generation with the
governors operating in droop (parallel, manual) mode:
```
       o Monitor the isochronous unit loading as new load is energized and as

```
cold load decreases to:

            - Ensure no overload of the isochronous unit occurs before

transferring load to a droop unit with available capacity.

            - Ensure cold load reduction does not threaten to trip the

isochronous unit on reverse power.

In all cases, monitor system performance (voltage and frequency excursions) during
load energization to assess whether smaller load block energization would be
appropriate.

**_2. Frequency Increase Prior to Load Pick up, Automatic Underfrequency Load_**

**_Shedding (UFLS)_**

Large frequency excursions are to be expected during system restoration. This is
most likely during the initial stages of system restoration where island sizes are 500

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


MW or less and load restoration is close to 5% of synchronized capability. To
minimize these excursions and prevent compounding them by the triggering of
Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and other subsequent cascading
problems, System Operators should employ the following methods:

    - Increase frequency to at least 60.3 Hertz prior to load pickup; if frequency is

expected to drop to less than 59.9 Hertz, increase frequency to no greater
than 61.2 Hertz prior to load pickup

    - Avoid the restoration of feeders with UFLS. (Initially avoiding UFLS is

preferred, but may not be possible based on substation design).

    - If UFLS feeders must be restored, restore the feeders set at the lowest

available frequency setpoint. NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC
Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding, Attachment C provides detailed
information on UFLS parameters in the Eastern Interconnection.

As island sizes grow to several hundred MW and the ratio of load block sizes to
synchronized generation decreases, smaller increases in frequency prior to load
pickup may become appropriate. System Operators may restore the portion of load
with UFLS that operate lower than 59.1 Hertz, provided that UFLS enabled feeders
are diverse and UFLS actuation would not initiate a frequency excursion of a
magnitude that would jeopardize system restoration action. These feeders may be
restored in quantities that could be used to provide reserve for generation
contingencies during system restoration.

Finally, as island/system sizes reach thousand(s) of MW, load block sizes should
become a small percent of synchronized generation and increasing/maintaining
frequency after, rather than prior, to load pickups should be sufficient. Full UFLS
capability should be considered and restored as appropriate. This will provide
backup protection for generation contingencies in these larger size islands/systems.

During system restoration, System Operators should observe analog/instantaneous
recordings of frequency response to actual load pickups (if available) and tailor
frequency increases and load block sizes to prevent excessive frequency excursions.

**_3. Cold Load Pickup_**

During system restoration, System Operators will be restoring feeder loads that have
been de-energized for unusually long periods of time (commonly referred to as ""cold
load""). Cold load refers to the loss of diversity between cycling loads on a feeder.
Upon re-energization of the load, simultaneous full demands of all the various load
components can be encountered. Consequently, System Operators should
anticipate cold load pickups that are 1.5 to 5 times greater than normal feeder loads.
Also, the longer the de-energization period, the longer it will take for the cold load
magnitude to decay to a more typical value. During system restoration, System

Operators will be required to modify load pickups depending upon the cold load
observed.

**L. Salient Electrical Concerns During System Restoration**

Reliable frequency and voltage performance (both transient and steady state) and
reliable circuit energizations are major concerns during system restoration, especially
during initial stages. The following general guidelines address these concerns.

**_1. Transmission Line Charging_**

**NOTE**

The charging values referenced below are typical charging values. A more complete
and specific set of 345 kV transmission line nominal charging values is contained in
Attachment C - Charging of 345 kV Circuits in New England. These values may be
used when and if system restoration strategies are employed, using Attachment G –
System Restoration Strategies

**NOTE**

Cables will not be energized using Rules of Thumb. Cable energizations will be
evaluated by support engineering prior to energization

Anticipate the introduction of shunt MVAr charging from line energizations and ensure
that adequate reactive control exists prior to line energizations. The following are
typical charging values:

**For overhead lines:**

     - 0.88 MVAr/mile for 345 kV

     - 0.28 MVAr/mile for 230 kV

     - 0.07 MVAr/mile for 115 kV

These figures show charging to be a critical concern on the 345 kV, a significant factor on
the 230 kV but much less of a concern on the 115 kV. Charging on cables is much higher
than that of overhead lines. These cable charging values, combined with a greater
likelihood of switching surge difficulties and pressurization problems for fluid-filled pipetype cables, underscore the need to delay the energization of cables until later stages of
system restoration. Cable energizations will be evaluated by support engineering prior to
energization. A list of shunt devices within New England that may be of benefit during
system restoration are provided in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 12 Voltage and Reactive Control, Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules (OP-12B).

**_2. Voltage Schedules at Generators_**

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


Voltage limits during system restoration are detailed in Attachment P, Restoration Voltage
Limits. ISO and LCC System Operators should work to maintain voltage schedules below
normal levels during system restoration. This will help combat charging from lightly
loaded transmission lines and consequential high voltage and excessive switching
surges. Lower voltage schedules will reduce transmission line MVAr charging (which is a
function of voltage squared) and promote leading operation of Generators and thus the
absorption of transmission line MVAr charging. As island/system sizes increase and
significant real power MW flows start to occur on transmission circuits, normal voltage
schedules at generating stations may become preferable. In any case, decisions on
voltage schedules should be based on actual system voltage levels and Generator
reactive loadings versus their leading reactive power limits. Generators are less stable
while absorbing reactive power and GOPs are less familiar with operating in this
condition; therefore, other options for absorbing reactive power or reducing the amount of
reactive power that has to be absorbed should be exercised to restore leading reactive
reserve on Generators.

**_3. Circuit Energizations_**

Perform circuit energizations in a deliberate manner. Prior to and after energization,
check:

    - The status of all associated facilities,

   - Synchronism, and

   - Reactive conditions.

Switching surges caused by inrush current on lines and transformers should be
considered for 345 kV. Excessive switching surges are not anticipated for
energizations on elements with voltages less than 345 kV.

In the early stages of system restoration, 345 kV line or 345/115 kV transformer
energizations should be performed with a source that has a total capability of 150 MVA
or more (could be one or more synchronized Generators); the specifics on this
determination are addressed in Attachment G – System Restoration Strategies. The
number and type of facilities that could be energized reliably will depend on line length
or transformer characteristics. Energizations of a 345 kV element that is performed
outside of the studied Primary or Alternate Paths shall be evaluated by ISO and the
applicable LCC(s) System Operators using Attachment G – System Restoration
Strategies. As system restoration progresses and the total capability of synchronized
sources builds up to several hundred MVA spread out over the system, the possibility of
excessive switching surges decreases substantially.

The simultaneous energization of a 345 kV transmission line and a 345 kV step-down
transformer should be avoided. In cases where this is not possible (no breaker

between the line and transformer), the energization of these circuits should be
performed with a strong nearby source or in later stages of system restoration when
sources are strong.

In general, a reactor connected to the tertiaries of 345 kV step-down transformers
should be closed-in prior to energization of the transformers. This will help prevent
excessively high switching and steady state voltages. Prior to switching, System
Operators should confirm that the reactor will be beneficial and sufficient reactive
reserve is available to maintain voltages after energization. In cases where multiple
reactors are available, System Operators should decide how many reactors can/should
be energized along with the 345 kV step-down transformer.

**NOTE**

**_The term Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) and its definition has been adopted by_**
**_NPCC in place of the term Special Protection System (SPS). For existing_**
**_documentation, the terms Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Special Protection_**
**_System (SPS) may be used until such time as the terminology is changed by the_**
**_Transmission Owner on equipment and schematics used in operations and in_**
**_the field. However, a subset of SPSs were not recognized as RAS and instead_**
**_became Automatic Control Schemes (ACS)_**

Remedial Action Schemes (RAS) or Automatic Control Schemes (ACS) that were
armed prior to a blackout event may remain armed following the event. System
Operators should be aware of which RASs/ACSs should remain armed following an
event. If an RAS/ACS could cause an undesired outcome or action, it is recommended
the RAS/ACS be disarmed.

**_4. Synchronizations_**

Generating stations are the preferred locations for synchronizing Generators, islands
or systems together. These stations have synchronizing equipment which is needed
for regular Generator phasing. Also, station operators should be versed in
synchronizing techniques. In the Plan, some synchronizations are planned at
transmission stations.   For these cases, the necessary means to match frequency
(including synchronizing equipment, operator knowledge and communication links to
predefined generating stations) have been considered.

At the circuit breaker where electrical islands will be synchronized, the voltage
magnitude of the two systems must be matched as closely as possible. Rules of Thumb
for system restoration are contained in Attachment G – System Restoration Strategies.
A rule of thumb would be to close the circuit breaker with not more than 3% voltage
difference between the two islands. The island with the dynamic voltage control device
closest to the synchronizing location should change the voltage. The frequency of the
two systems must also be matched as closely as possible. The difference should be no
greater than 20º of relative phase angle rotation per second,  or a synchroscope

||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|


rotation of not more than one (1) full revolution in 18 seconds.   The smaller island
frequency should be controlled and run at a slightly higher frequency. Finally, the syncscope phase should be as close to the 12 o’clock position as possible and certainly
within +/-3 minutes (or about +/- 20º) of vertical upon breaker closure.

**M. Inter-Island Ties**

The synchronization/energization of inter-island ties should occur during fairly early
stages of system restoration. This should minimize problems associated with needing to
synchronize many small islands or trying to match frequencies of two large islands. It
would also promote the most effective use of available Resources to restore the system
in the least amount of time. Synchronization/energization of inter-island ties during
system restoration shall always be performed in accordance with M/LCC 18 and:

(1) only with the authorization of ISO; or

(2) if communications with ISO fail, if prudent to total system restoration and

communications between the affected parties exist

Attachment D lists the Inter-LCC Ties operating at 115 kV and above. ISO and LCC
System Operators should complete Attachment N – Interconnection/Synchronization
Checklist for interconnection/synchronization criteria during a system restoration event.

**N. Inter-RCA/BAA Ties**

Restoration of the Eastern Interconnection is a priority objective of the Plan. The same
reasons for early establishment of inter-LCC ties apply to synchronous inter-RCA/BAA
ties. However, the lack of direct control over switching operations in other RCA/BAAs
and their overall status/reliability should be considered before establishing ties. ISO
System Operators should complete Attachment N – Interconnection/Synchronization
Checklist for interconnection/synchronization criteria during a system restoration event.

Reliable operation of most HVdc converters requires that strong ac systems exist. For
this reason, System Operators should not attempt to energize HVdc ties during early
phases of system restoration unless it is known that their design will allow reliable
operation with weak ac systems. Interconnection/synchronization of inter-RCA-BAA ties
during system restoration shall always be performed in accordance with M/LCC 18 and:

(1) only with the authorization of ISO; or

(2) if communications with ISO fail, if prudent to total system restoration and

communications between the affected parties exist.

Attachment E lists the Inter-RCA/BAA Ties and guidelines for when the HVdc ties can be
reliably restored. Attachment E also includes indications as to whether a given InterRCA/BAA Tie is an interconnection point on a Primary or Alternate Path of the Plan as

well as indications as to which side of the border the substation is located, where the
interconnection will take place.

**O. Reporting Requirements During System Restoration**

The ISO Restoration Coordinator shall establish communications with LCC restoration
coordinators and with the restoration coordinators of each adjacent RC power system to
facilitate a flow of information that will promote coordinated system restoration. The ISO
Restoration Coordinator shall be the primary contact for disseminating information
regarding system restoration to the restoration coordinators of neighboring RCs, and to
the LCC restoration coordinators. During system restoration, the ISO Restoration
Coordinator shall monitor the progress of system restoration and provide periodic
reports to LCCs and each adjacent RC power system, as necessary and appropriate.

**NOTE**

Refer to M/LCC 6, Attachment A - ISO New England Evacuation Procedure Telephone
List (Confidential) for Contact information for neighboring RCs.

Each LCC restoration coordinator shall establish communications with the ISO
Restoration Coordinator and the restoration coordinators of adjacent LCCs to provide a
flow of information that promotes coordinated system restoration and to monitor, advise
and help coordinate with the ISO and adjacent LCCs. Each LCC restoration coordinator
shall monitor the progress of system restoration in its area and provide periodic reports
to the ISO Restoration Coordinator and the restoration coordinators of neighboring
LCCs, as necessary and appropriate.

ISO and LCC restoration coordinators shall share information regarding the progress of
system restoration or any issues regarding system restoration as necessary and
appropriate to promote reliability and keep appropriate entities informed within the limits
of the Tariff, Attachment D - ISO New England Information Policy

|---|---|
|Owner: ISO Director, Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|
||Review Due Date: April 4, 2026|


# 1. References

None

# 2. Purpose

1. To verify Local Control Centers (LCCs) conduct an overall assessment of the reliability of

the Resource and transmission system in New England for the Summer Operating
Period (June through September) and Winter Operating Period (December through
March).

2. To document that the necessary preparations are made to the Bulk Electric System

(BES) to maintain reliability during seasonal periods of peak demand and high power
transfers.

# 3. Introduction

1. During the Summer Season, the BES is subject to the highest system load demand.

Large power transfers require increased reactive capabilities to verify required voltages
can be maintained. Temperature sensitive equipment such as cables and transformers
must have adequate cooling to be able to sustain loading at their ratings. Contingencies
on the system or planned outages can cause increased loading on remaining equipment
which result in increased I[2]X losses that can severely impact reactive reserves and
cause unacceptable voltages.

2. During the Winter Season, severe weather can affect proper operation of equipment

which could degrade system reliability. Temperature sensitive equipment, such as
circuit breakers, gas insulated switchgear and air blast circuit breakers are susceptible to
leaks and forced outages during extreme cold conditions.

3. Equipment forced outages will be minimized by performing Seasonal Preparations prior

to the heavy system load demands experienced during summer extreme hot periods,
and winter extreme cold periods.

# 4. Responsibilities

1. The ISO Manager, Control Room Operations shall verify the applicable Season

Preparations are performed by the LCCs and documented in accordance with this
procedure.

2. The LCCs are responsible for providing complete and accurate information for their

equipment Seasonal Preparations.

3. Action plans will be developed for any problems or deficiencies discovered in the

Seasonal Preparations process.

## I. Real-Time Assessment Data

ISO-NE is responsible for performing the Transmission Operator (TOP) function for the
New England Transmission System. Each Local Control Center (LCC) is responsible for
performing the TOP function for its respective area.

Each entity is required to continually perform Real-Time Monitoring of the bulk electric
system (BES) and ensure that a Real-Time Assessment (RTA) is performed at least once
every 30-minutes. RTAs are supported by the Energy Management System (EMS) using a
current network model and data that provides System Operators timely BES information.

The following list represents data inputs that can be used to support RTAs:

  - Real-Time System Demand

   - Real-Time Resource status (both in-service and out-of-service)

  - Real-Time Resource AVR/PSS status for applicable Resources

  - Real-Time Resource Active and Reactive power output

   - Real-Time Transmission Element status (both in-service and out-of-service)

  - Real-Time Phase Angle Regulators (PARs) and Load Tap Changer (LTC) tap positions

  - Real-Time status of Remedial Action Schemes (RAS) and monitored Automatic Control

Schemes (ACS)

  - Applied Resource and Transmission element ratings

   - Real-Time status of applicable AC/DC inverter facilities

   - Real-Time Interchange (Real and Reactive power flow)

   - Real-Time Interface transfer limits

The list is not intended to be all-inclusive or exclusive.

|---|---|
|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|
||Review Due Date: February 6, 2025|



       - List Primary and Secondary Voltage ICCP IDs Referenced by MLCC 15 Att I

       - Review system operating voltage corresponding with Operating Issues.

       - Conduct operating studies to coordinate voltage schedules of Resources

connecting to the 345 kV, 230 kV and 115 kV to improve reactive reserves in
the system, when consulted by the ISO

       - Review and conduct operating studies to determine appropriate no-load tap

position (NLTP) settings of bulk power transformers, when consulted by the
ISO

**7.2 Process for Generating Resources Voltage Schedule Coordination**

A. Voltage schedules for each Resource listed in OP-12B are selected based on the
applicable TO’s system specific requirements. In general, these schedules are
developed based on the normal operating transmission voltage at the Resource
point of connection as well as the local system needs for reactive power control.
When determining the appropriate voltage schedule and tolerance band, the VTF
may perform additional studies to confirm that the scheduled voltage is appropriate
to support system voltages within established voltage limits and to maintain
adequate levels of leading and lagging reactive reserves.

**7.3 Process for ULTC or NLTP Bulk Power Transformers Voltage Coordination**

A. Voltage Schedules of bulk power transformers listed in OP-12B are selected by
the TO to meet specific local and system requirements and to maintain equipment
within safe and reliable voltage levels.

When system performance may be improved by optimizing voltage schedules, ISO
and the VTF may conduct an ad-hoc study to review the existing voltage schedule
of ULTC (under-load-tap-changing) autotransformers or NLTP settings of one or
more autotransformers to achieve optimal voltage levels on the transmission
system and to provide the maximum protection for contingencies that can lead to
high or low voltages.

## 1. Purpose

Table 1 identifies the SOL and IROL Interfaces by LCC and by name, which can be used by
each applicable LCC to monitor its SOL and IROL Interfaces. These SOL and IROL Interfaces
do **not include all SOL and IROL limits. For a full list of SOL and IROL limits, refer to the**
Transmission Operating Guides. In addition, critical IROL interfaces in adjoining areas
monitored in EMS are also noted below.

The definition for each Interface can be found under “Generic Interface Constraints” on the
external ISO-NE website at:

## I. Contingency Impact Evaluation

The following presents the general philosophy/method for determining if a contingency
will have unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact.

1. Simulate the contingency.

2. Identify any elements that are overloaded at or above their STE rating.

3. Open each STE overloaded element and rerun the EMS powerflow or other loadflow

application.

A. Do not perform any manual switching of reactive devices between cascade steps

4. Repeat steps 2) and 3) and determine Inter RCA/BAA impact as follows:

A. If the element STE overloads/openings stop and the case solves without severe

voltage/reactive conditions (such as voltage at or below 328 kV on the 345 kV
system or voltage at or below 207 or 104 kV, respectively, on the 230 / 115 kV
systems), Inter RCA/BAA impact is acceptable.

       - Treat as an IROL if either of the following post-contingent conditions occur:
```
            o When voltage on two or more non-radial 345 kV stations is below

```
95% of nominal voltage (328 kV) or
```
            o When transmission stations serving 500 MW or more net load

```
have post-contingent voltage at or below 95% of nominal voltage
on the 345 kV system, or less than 90% of nominal voltage on the
230 or 115kV systems.

       - In outage coordination, note the scope of voltages at or below the above

noted thresholds

B. If the element STE overloads/openings continue to the point where an element in

the New York ISO RCA/BAA becomes overloaded at or above its LTE rating,

[STE allowed for underground cable circuits (except NNC, Y49, Y50 901 and 903
circuits, which are cable circuits)] unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact is
indicated.

C. If the element STE overloads/openings continue to the point where the case will

**not solve, demarcate the subarea in the New England Transmission System that**
would separate from the rest of the system. This should be based on the
cascading overload pattern evidenced by the load flows. Then go back to the
original case and calculate the net power flow into or out of the subarea that
would be separated. Unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact is possible if the
subarea is supplying ≥ 1,200 MW to the rest of the system or if it is absorbing ≥
1,200 MW of power. If the subarea is supplying < 1,200 MW or absorbing < 1,200
MW, the contingency would not have unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact.

## 2. Background

The purpose of this Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC) Procedure is to describe the
reliability methodology developed and used by ISO New England (ISO) and Local Control
Centers (LCCs) for operational planning and Real-Time operations of the New England
Transmission System[1],in accordance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation
(NERC) Reliability Standard FAC-010 System Operating Limits Methodology for the
Planning Horizon, FAC-011 System Operating Limits Methodology for the Operations
Horizon and FAC-014 Establish and Communicate System Operating Limits. Prescribed
operator actions are further detailed in ISO Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission
Operations (OP-19) and in several ISO Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs), ISO
System Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC)
Procedures.

NERC Reliability Standards and NPCC Directories and Criteria documents define specific
requirements applicable to the design, planning and operation of the New England
Transmission System. The provisions in this document and in OP-19 are used to determine
the data and methodology used by ISO for the development of System Operating Limits
(SOLs), and the subset of SOLs classified as Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits
(IROLs) that are used for the operational planning and Real-Time operation of the New
England Transmission System.

## 3. Responsibilities

ISO is responsible for performing the Reliability Coordinator (RC), Transmission Operator
(TOP), and the Balancing Authority (BA) functions for the New England Transmission
System. LCCs are responsible for performing the TOP function for their local areas. ISO
and the LCCs are responsible for identifying SOLs. ISO is responsible for identifying the
subset of SOLs that qualify as IROLs.

ISO and the LCCs are responsible for ensuring their respective network models use the
same facility ratings as recorded in the NX-9 Transmission Information database unless
temporary ratings have been implemented or the NX-9 data has been determined to be
erroneous; in this case, the NX-9 data shall be updated as soon as possible.

ISO and the LCCs are responsible for ensuring that their respective network models use the
same generator technical characteristics as recorded in the NX-12 Generator Technical
Data in the Customer Asset Management System (CAMS) database.

ISO and the LCCs coordinate to monitor system loading and the status of applicable
elements of the New England Transmission System that could result in SOL or IROL
exceedances or that are, or could be, critical to SOLs and IROLs within the New England

1 The New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Tariff and includes the Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area

(RCA/BAA), Bulk Electric System and bulk power system elements found within New England on the transmission network.

Transmission System. Such monitoring allows ISO and the LCCs to know the current status
of all facilities whose failure, degradation or disconnection could result in an SOL or IROL
exceedance.

ISO has clear decision-making authority, action plans, and agreements in place to
immediately take actions, or to direct LCCs and Market Participants (MPs) within the New
England Transmission System to take actions, to preserve the integrity and reliability of the
New England Transmission System and the Interconnection. ISO and the LCCs operate the
New England Transmission System to protect against instability, uncontrolled separation, or
cascading outages from single-element contingencies and specified multiple-element
contingencies. Information concerning these contingencies and how ISO respects the
transmission system limits associated with these contingencies in system operations is
contained within OP-19 and this Procedure.

ISO and the LCCs are jointly responsible for monitoring and mitigating SOLs and IROLs in
Real-Time. In instances where there is a difference in derived limits, ISO requires that the
LCCs, TOPs and MPs operate the New England Transmission System to the most
conservative limit.

In operating the New England Transmission System, ISO makes every effort to have the
New England Transmission System remain connected to the Eastern Interconnection.
However, if ISO determines that by remaining interconnected, ISO is in imminent danger of
exceeding an IROL, ISO will take actions or direct actions to protect the New England
Transmission System.

This Procedure requires ISO to discuss options to mitigate potential or actual IROL
exceedance with other affected RCs and to take actions, as necessary, to act in the best
interests of the Interconnection at all times. ISO informs potentially affected LCCs and RCs
of Real-Time or anticipated EMERGENCY System Conditions, discusses options, decides
upon solutions to prevent or resolve the identified problem and takes actions to avoid, when
possible, or mitigate the problem. ISO also requires that system protection is coordinated
among operating entities. When ISO is notified of a relay or equipment degradation or
outage that reduces system reliability, ISO takes corrective action, or directs the LCCs to
take corrective action, as soon as possible.

If in operating the New England Transmission System, ISO or an LCC enter an unknown
operating state (i.e., any state for which valid operating limits have not been determined),
they will restore operations to respect limits within 30 minutes. Examples of unknown
operating states, and remediation actions, include but are not limited to:

  - When a defined interface has a voltage/stability limit for one or more elements out-of
service and then an additional line on the specified interface is removed from service,
the present voltage/stability limit is unknown. The ISO on-call engineer will be notified
as soon as reasonably possible and will promptly provide a revised voltage/stability
limit for the applicable interface, all preferably within the first five minutes of entering
an unknown operating state.

## 4. Network Model and Inputs

 4.1 Network Model

The ISO network model used in the Real-Time operations horizon is contained in the
ISO Energy Management System (EMS) and includes all Resources and transmission
facilities in the New England Transmission System and an equivalence model for other
69 kV and radial 115 kV facilities within New England. In addition, ISO models all key
Resources and transmission above 230 kV as well as an equivalence model for the 115
kV and 138 kV in both the neighboring RCAs of New Brunswick and New York. The
Quebec transmission system is asynchronously interconnected to New England via
HVDC and is therefore not explicitly modeled; instead, it is modeled as Resource or
load.

For the operational planning horizon, transient stability, dynamic stability and voltage
stability analysis, ISO uses an off-line network study model contained in the Siemens
Power Technology International (PTI) Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E)
to identify those contingencies that may be identified as an SOL or IROL. This off-line
network model originates from the NERC Multiregional Modeling Working Group
(MMWG) series of network models. The level of modeling detail meets or exceeds the
NERC MMWG modeling requirements and the requirements of NERC Modeling
Standards.

For Real-Time and near Real-Time thermal and voltage analysis, the EMS network
model Powerflow is used. This model includes the applicable approved transmission
outages, Resource outages, load forecast, estimated external transaction schedules and
Resource schedule. ISO also uses the EMS applications including Study-time
Contingency Analysis (STCA), Real-Time Contingency Analysis (RTCA) and the
Interface Limit Calculator (ILC) to model all identified contingencies. The ISO network
model also includes the modeling and operation of approved Remedial Action Schemes
(RASs) and Automatic Control Schemes (ACSs), where appropriate. The network model
data and inputs System Operators use to perform Real-Time Assessments (RTA) are
identified in Attachment L – Real-Time Assessment Data.

## 4.2 Transmission Facility Ratings

The foundation of the process for calculating thermal- or voltage-based SOLs is the
establishment of a comprehensive model of the facilities comprising the New England
Transmission System and adjacent AC systems. Transmission facility ratings are the
foundation for the calculation of thermal-or voltage-based SOLs.

Transmission facility ratings are required to be supplied to ISO by the Transmission
Owners (TOs) per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission
System Data (OP-16) using the NX-9 data form. ISO administers an NX9 certification
process that requires TOs to annually certify that all transmission equipment identified in

|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|
|---|---|
|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|
||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|


OP-16 is accurately represented on the appropriate NX-9 form. The NX-9 form contains
data on the transmission element (transformer, line, reactor, capacitor, etc.) and the
limiting component (relay, disconnect switch, etc.) as well as the Summer/Winter,
Normal, Long-Time Emergency (LTE), Short-Time Emergency (STE) and Drastic Action
Limit (DAL) ratings. The basis for the calculation of any SOL starts first with a
comprehensive model of the facilities comprising the New England Transmission System
and adjacent AC systems.

Either the TOs or LCCs provide voltage limits based upon facility ratings. The voltage
limits include: Normal Voltage Limit (NORMVL), Long-Time Emergency Voltage Limit
(LTEVL), Short-Time Emergency Voltage Limit (STEVL) and Drastic Action Voltage Limit
(DAVL). High and low voltage limits are provided for NORMVL: both high and low
voltage limits may not be declared for LTEVL, STEVL and DAVL. Voltage limits must be
provided for all voltage levels monitored by the LCC (such as 345, 230, 115 and 69 kV)
so that all stations with voltage monitoring may be checked for adherence to the voltage
limits. The most limiting voltage limit will always be used where different voltage limits
exist within a station or in adjacent stations. The voltage limits provided must exceed inservice BES under voltage relay settings.

## 4.3 Generator Technical Characteristics

The technical characteristics for Resources defined as Generators per ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand
Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation
Resources (OP-14) are required to be supplied by the Designated Entity to ISO, using
the NX-12 data form. The NX-12 form contains data on the technical characteristics of
the Generator units (response rates, MW and MVAr operating limits, etc.) that will be
used in the network model.

The Generator voltage schedules specified in ISO New England Operating Procedure
No. 12 Voltage and Reactive Control (OP-12), Appendix B - Voltage and Reactive
Schedules used in system operations and studies, are developed to meet SOLs and
IROLs per the criteria and limits, as well as limiting contingencies, defined in OP-19 and
its Appendices, and this Procedure and its Attachments.

## 5. Determining, Operating to and Communicating SOLs and IROLs

The SOL determination methodology requires that an SOL provides acceptable New
England Transmission System performance, as described in OP-19. Consequently, the New
England Transmission System is operated so that, in the pre-contingent state, it shall
demonstrate transient, dynamic and voltage stability; all facilities shall be within their facility
limits. The New England Transmission System shall continue to demonstrate transient,
dynamic and voltage stability; all facilities shall be within their thermal, voltage and stability
limits in the post-contingency state. The New England Transmission System operators (ISO
and each LCC) determine SOLs. In the ISO and LCC determination of an SOL, the New
England Transmission System conditions shall reflect current or expected system conditions,
changes to system topology such as facility outages (including outages of protection
systems) and facility de-ratings. ISO will commit and dispatch Resources, if available, in
order to meet N-1 contingency coverage for an SOL, and N-1-1 coverage for an IROL. For
SOLs, the impacted LCC(s) shall have the responsibility to identify if there is a need for post
N-1 and/or pre N-1-1 firm load shedding. The impacted LCC(s) shall have the responsibility
to determine the appropriate action plan to mitigate the firm load-shedding needed. The
mitigation may include commitment and dispatch of Resources, an enhanced limit or a postcontingent action plan.

In the NERC Reliability Standards for Interconnection Reliability Operations and
Coordination (IRO) it is stated that, for any identified IROL that is exceeded, the RC in
conjunction with the TOP and BA will return its transmission system within the IROL limit.
These actions shall be taken without delay, but no longer than 30 minutes. The criteria time
limit in New England shall be 30 minutes to mitigate all IROL exceedances.

An SOL will normally be cleared within a two-hour period from the time of identification in
contingency analysis or ILC. For an SOL, ISO and any impacted LCC will prepare and
implement mitigation measures within the applicable time period after identification. These
measures may include, but are not limited to, dispatch of Resources, facility switching and/or
the application of enhanced thermal or voltage limits.

An SOL experienced in Real-Time needs immediate resolution; the applicable time Tv
depends on the applicable limit, thermal or voltage, and may be shorter than two hours.
Voltage SOLs have time limits, determined by the applicable LCC, as stated in MLCC 15
Attachment H and OP-19 Appendix K - Operating Voltage Limits by LCC.

The following SOL exceedances will be communicated between ISO and the impacted
LCCs:

   - IROL exceedances

    - SOL exceedances of stability limits

   - Post-contingency SOL exceedances that have that have been confirmed to potentially

become an IROL

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|



 - Pre-contingency SOL exceedances of Facility Ratings

 - Pre-contingency SOL exceedances of normal minimum System Voltage Limits

The following SOL exceedances must be communicated between ISO and the impacted
LCCs if they persist for more than 30 minutes:

 - Post-contingency SOL exceedances of Facility Ratings or emergency System Voltage

Limits

 - Post-contingency SOL exceedances of normal maximum System Voltage Limits

These communications will use the processes described in MLCC 13 – ISO and LCC
Communication Practices.

When determining the start time of an IROL or SOL exceedance, ISO and any impacted LCC
will use the contingency analysis that first identified the IROL/SOL exceedance. In
responding to an SOL, ISO and any impacted LCC will implement all applicable precontingency NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions, (as defined in OP-19). Pre-contingency
load-shedding may be avoided if the TO or TOP (i.e., LCC) authorizes an enhanced facility
thermal or voltage limit and the LCC has developed an implementable post-contingency
action plan to operate the facility within enhanced limits. When the local area involves two or
more TOs, the appropriate LCC will coordinate the actions required by the TOs in response
to the local area contingency. When the impacted TO(s) / LCC(s) cannot agree on a postcontingency action plan, all applicable pre-contingency NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions
will be used to resolve the SOL. This provision shall not be used for IROLs.

All agreements to operate to the enhanced facility limit and the use of post-contingent action
plans shall be communicated to ISO electronically, prior to implementation. Use of a
recorded line is acceptable for these purposes. Written documentation of the agreements
and post-contingent action plans shall be provided electronically (e.g., facsimile, email, etc.)
to ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed 24 hours from the time the enhanced rating or
limit/post-contingent action plan was first provided.

Any operation beyond an SOL for the applicable time period would not only constitute an
exceedance, but may rise to the level of a violation. An example of this would be operation
in Real-Time beyond an SOL (i.e., operation above the DAL rating). The violation
determination and, if confirmed, root cause investigation, would be made following a
technical review of the facts. For potential low voltage and IROL violations, such
determinations are made by the ISO Operations Support Services department engineering
staff in cooperation with the appropriate LCC staff. The LCC staff, with the appropriate TOs,
would lead the determinations for potential high voltage violations.

## 5.1 Thermal SOLs

ISO performs studies in order to establish seasonal and operational planning
transmission interface limits to prevent thermal overloads or cascading thermal
overloads. ISO establishes these limits by evaluating system response to all the

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|


contingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J - Contingency List and Criteria/Limits. Most
of the contingencies are observed at all times and are used to determine SOLs; a subset
of multi-element contingencies is only observed where the contingency could cause an
IROL or cause unit instability. These studies therefore include:

a) the anticipated system conditions,

b) a range of Resource availability and transmission outage scenarios,

c) various peak load assumptions and

d) simulation of defined protection schemes (RAS/ACS) actions where appropriate.

The limits are developed such that no facility limits are exceeded under a base-case set
of assumptions. Then, ISO evaluates system performance assuming first contingency
(N-1) to evaluate whether post-contingency loadings result in an SOL. Additionally, for
IROLs, ISO evaluates the system in Real-Time to determine if adequate Resources and
operational actions are available to reposition the system within 30 minutes to a new
operating state that allows continued reliable operation in the event that a second
contingency (N-1-1) occurs. This type of analysis confirms the system can both:

a) withstand a first contingency and

b) be repositioned to withstand the second contingency within the appropriate time

period (30 minutes or 120 minutes), without resulting in an IROL / SOL.

Transfer limits developed for system operation use the same methodology. For transfer
limits developed for N-1-1 interfaces, opening the limiting transmission element can be
utilized if:

  - the facility operates at 115kV or below

  - the limitation is thermally-based

  - the facility would be opened post first contingency

  - the ISO Control Room consulted with Real-Time Studies to determine if there

were adverse voltage or stability consequences from opening the facility

  - the impacted LCC was consulted and approved the post-contingent opening of

the facility

For reliable operation with N-1 considerations, the same evaluation process can be used
to open a breaker for limiting stuck breaker contingencies if:

  - the limitation is thermally based

  - the ISO Control Room consulted with Real-Time Studies to determine if there

were adverse voltage or stability consequences from opening the facility

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|



    - the impacted LCC was consulted and approved the pre-contingent opening of the

facility

Enhanced facility limits will be considered by ISO if provided by the TO or TOP (i.e.,
LCC) when a facility limit has been identified as the basis for an SOL, even in Real-Time.
As noted in OP-19, the TO may provide enhanced facility limits to ISO and the LCC that
reflect the impact of current ambient conditions, or other appropriate limit assumption
changes, that may allow for an enhanced facility limit for a transmission facility. All
enhanced facility limits provided shall be communicated to ISO electronically or over a
recorded phone line prior to implementation; documentation of the enhanced facility
limits in writing (e.g., facsimile, email, etc.) shall be provided electronically to ISO in a
timely manner not to exceed 24 hours. Enhanced facility limits are expected to include
two aspects - the facility limit and the allowed time duration for its use. For example, an
enhanced thermal limit for a facility may be a two-minute limit to allow post-contingent
actions to be applied within two minutes to return the facility to its normally utilized facility
limit set (Normal, LTE, STE, and DAL). The main difference between enhanced limits
and limits resulting from weather-sensitive ratings is that enhanced limits can exist for
time periods shorter than those defined in our set of supported ratings (Normal, LTE,
STE and DAL).

## 5.2 Voltage and Reactive SOLs

ISO performs studies to establish transmission interface limits to prevent cascading
voltage collapse by testing all contingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J. Most of the
contingencies are observed at all times and are used to determine SOLs; a subset of
multi-element contingencies is only observed where the contingency could cause an
IROL. Where appropriate, simulations of defined protection scheme (RAS/ACS) actions
are included in the studies.

These analyses are conducted prior to Real-Time operations and use a set of stressed
system conditions, such as:

a) a range of high-load levels to aggravate low voltage problems;

b) a range of low-load levels to aggravate high voltage problems;

c) a range of Resource availability to quantify the impact on the voltage problem;

and

d) inclusion of Resource and transmission maintenance conditions

These analyses are conducted using standard load-flow techniques. The analyses
identify limits by either detecting an exceedance of acceptable minimum/maximum
voltage limits on transmission buses or detecting the failure of simulations to converge an event which signals a voltage collapse. Once a maximum transfer limit is determined
by a convergent solution containing acceptable voltage profiles, ISO will then reduce the
transmission interface limit by an engineering safety margin. The magnitude of the

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|


margin is based on reviewing the P-V system response and maintaining sufficient
gradients between the pre-contingency voltages and the limiting post-contingency
voltages. Typically these engineering safety margins are approximately 50 MW to
100 MW. Utilizing the study assumptions of a stressed system and operating at this
reduced transfer limit provides a safety margin to protect against widespread voltage
instability or collapse and prevent an IROL.

SOL identification will utilize the voltage limits supplied. A voltage SOL exceedance will
occur when:

     - A transmission substation has a voltage beyond the applicable voltage limit
```
      o Exception 1: Radial transmission stations, either by design or the result of a

```
contingency, with voltages below the low voltage limits will not be considered
SOLs. This exception may also be applicable, following LCC review, for
voltages beyond the high voltage limits, for the duration defined by the
affected LCC(s),
```
      o Exception 2: Any high voltage exceedance that can be mitigated in less than

```
five minutes at 107% or less of nominal voltage (where the high limit is 105%
of nominal), will not be considered a high voltage SOL exceedance.[2]

            - This would only apply to Real-Time conditions or Real-Time

Contingency Analysis. The voltage limits in M/LCC15 Attachment H
– Voltage SOL Identification Procedure (M/LCC15H), shall be used
in next-day planning, which includes mitigating actions (including
unit commitment) when exceedance of a high voltage limit of 105%
of nominal is indicated.

     - The system performance assessment determines that a voltage collapse is likely

to occur. Indications of voltage collapse include:
```
       o a non-converged power flow solution

```
2 The following factors justify this determination:

 - The transmission system has been planned by transmission owners allowing load-tap-changing transformers and switched capacitors / reactors to move

post-contingency before application of voltage limits. Prior to movement of these devices, modest over-voltage conditions can be present for those short
periods of time. Therefore, since the system has been designed and control / protection settings applied to allow these actions, the immediate postcontingency over-voltage conditions are acceptable.

 - Transmission capacitors banks in New England have automatic switch out voltage setpoints over 105% of nominal (most set at 107% of nominal) with

time delays varying between many seconds up to 10 minutes. These time delays have been used for years, and operation of the equipment at those
voltage levels, for those short time periods, is acceptable.

 - Voltage unbalance exists in all three phase power systems, and the New England system is no exception. The level of unbalance is often on the order of

1 to 2%. That means when any station voltage, monitored on a single phase basis, indicates 105% of nominal, the other phase voltages could be as high
as 107%. There is no preclusion from operating at 105% of nominal for extended periods of time, which means there is no preclusion for extended
periods of operation of other phases as high as 107% of nominal.

```
      o a voltage below the defined voltage-collapse threshold documented in

```
M/LCC15H
```
      o rapidly dropping voltage based upon modest changes in system load or

```
transfer, based upon system conditions, at voltage levels above the voltage
limits provided by the TO

The potential for an IROL is determined through use of standard load-flow techniques for
the area in question. In the determination analysis, the area is examined beyond the
transfer limit to determine the subarea that may be lost due to voltage collapse. The
analysis methods used to determine this subarea may include Q/V analysis using
reactive power injection sources or manipulation of the limiting facility’s impedance to
achieve a last solution before insolubility. The IROL list from OP-19 Section II.A.1.b
would be used to determine the existence of a potential IROL based upon this analysis.

SOL determination for voltage operating limits requires LCC identification of the SOL or
ISO identification of the potential SOL and subsequent LCC concurrence of the SOL
existence. Use of this method allows the more detailed local system modeling of the
LCCs to be consulted before SOL confirmation by the LCC and ISO. Either the LCC or
ISO can identify a voltage collapse SOL.

If a TO or LCC provides an enhanced limit to resolve a voltage SOL to preclude precontingent load shedding, they must provide the loads to be shed post-contingent to
resolve the SOL.

Transmission System voltage schedules have been established for the New England
Transmission System to operate within SOLs and IROLs for expected system conditions.
For transmission stations with generators, dynamic reactive resources, and load tapchanging transformers, these voltage schedules are documented in OP-12, Appendix B.
The resulting pre-contingency transmission operating voltage range is normally between
100% and 105% of nominal for all transmission voltage classes (115, 230 and 345 kV).
The voltage schedules and resulting transmission operating range support the meeting
of system voltage SOLs and IROLs based upon the voltage limits and criteria listed in
OP-19 and its Appendices, and this Procedure and its Attachments.

## 5.3 Transient and Dynamic Stability SOLs

ISO performs studies to establish transmission interface limits to prevent unit/area
instability, insufficiently damped system response, or unacceptable transient low voltage
conditions. The ISO uses the following criteria and guidelines when performing stability
studies:

       - Steady state voltage stability : The ISO applies the voltage limits listed in OP

19 Appendix K and engineering judgement when examining voltage
performance in stability analysis results

      - Transient voltage response: As listed in ISO NE’s Transmission Planning

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|


Technical Guide – Appendix B

     - Angular stability: Resource stability required for all tested normal criteria

faults. No more than 20 MW of generation shall trip and remain off-line
following a fault / fault clearance / system disturbance, at transmission or
lower system voltages

    - System damping: As listed in ISO NE’s Transmission Planning Technical

Guide – Appendix C

To do these studies, ISO conducts testing under a range of system conditions, including
testing the system at light load conditions due to the reduced system damping available
from load and inertia from limited online Resources. The system model tested includes
all of New England, and significant detail in the adjacent RC areas, at a minimum.
Significant sensitivities to Resource dispatch, reactive equipment availability,
bus/breaker configurations, line/breaker-out conditions, defined protection scheme
(RAS/ACS) action/in-action, etc., are all considered in the testing. RAS response may
be modeled and considered for potential IROLs and SOLs, while limited RAS will only be
considered for SOL outcomes and not IROLs. Under-frequency load shedding will not be
relied upon at all when establishing stability limits.

The transmission interface limits are determined using standard transient stability
simulations of the contingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J and are limited by
unit/area instability, insufficiently-damped system response, or unacceptable transient
low voltage conditions. The list of contingencies in OP-19, Appendix J will be evaluated
for revision based upon available feedback, including that from ISO NE planning on
appropriate contingencies to consider for stability analysis.

Once the transfer limit is determined with acceptable dynamic performance through the
analysis, ISO will reduce the transmission interface limit by an engineering safety margin
of approximately 50 MW to 100 MW. At this limit, damping is evaluated to determine if
the dampening criterion is met. If so, no additional buffer is included; if not, transfers
are continually reduced and re-evaluated until the dampening criterion is met. As this is
the case with voltage or reactive limit exceedances, it is necessary to operate at this
reduced transfer limit to protect against unit/area instability, insufficiently damped system
response, an unacceptable transient low voltage condition, and to prevent an SOL/IROL
exceedance.

The results of the analysis, and the potential consequences for not adhering to the
stability limit, are examined against the IROL list in OP-19 Section II.A.1.b. Machine
instability for one or more units may be included as a potential IROL based upon the fact
that unit instability may lead to other system concerns such as:

  - Uncontrolled loss of transmission elements adjacent to, or remote from, the

Resource in question:
```
   o The uncontrolled loss of transmission elements is an example of an “inability

```
to determine if a discrete sub-area of the system is susceptible to voltage

collapse or uncontrolled separation from the rest of the system” (an IROL
example from OP-19)
```
     o This may lead to multiple 345 kV elements (lines, transformers and

```
substations) being lost due to unit instability of a 345 kV-connected generator.

Finally, ISO evaluates system operations in response to the extreme contingency threephase fault with delayed clearing in order to:

a) measure system strength;

b) determine the extent of a widespread system disturbance; and

c) impose an additional reduction in the transmission interface limit depending on

the system impact.

The results of these studies are shared with impacted LCCs and adjacent RCs, as
appropriate, with feedback and comments sought before finalizing the analysis and
limits.

## 5.4 Transmission Interfaces and ILC

ISO determines N-1-1 transmission interface limits for importing areas identified as
having the potential to be an IROL within the New England RCA. This is performed so
that adequate post “first contingency” actions to redispatch the New England
Transmission System within 30 minutes of the “first contingency” (N-1) are available and
the ISO is prepared for the next contingency. ISO communicates these limits to all
LCCs. ISO continually refines and updates study assumptions for identifying
transmission interface limits up to and including Real-Time.

In Real-Time, ISO and LCC software (such as the ISO ILC) is configured to alert the ISO
and LCC System Operators when potential exists for exceeding an SOL or IROL
associated with an interface due to Real-Time system conditions. The ISO ILC
interfaces are listed in Attachment J of this procedure. System Operators will preposition Resources (e.g., generation) or take other pre-contingent NORMAL actions
when system flows indicate that an IROL exceedance may occur if a contingency were
to take place or, in the case of N-1-1 interface limits, if there would be inadequate
actions available to redispatch the system within 30 minutes in preparation for the next
contingency. In addition, ISO and LCC contingency analysis (CA) applications will
identify specific stuck-breaker, bus-fault and double-circuit tower contingencies to
evaluate whether they would result in a potential IROL. These specific contingencies are
identified in the Attachments of this Procedure; please refer to Section 6 for a description
of the Attachments.

## 5.5 Single Source Contingencies

Joint RC studies have concluded that the loss of a supply source at high levels of
imports (greater than 1,200 MW) could have a larger effect on NYISO and PJM than the
worst internal contingency that these individual systems normally protect against. ISO
monitors and will dispatch its large Single Source Contingencies against the PJM and
NYISO limiting interfaces such that the New England system does not impose an IROL
on another area in Real-Time.

## 5.6 Real-Time Transmission Protection and Relay Outages

Transmission Owners shall notify the ISO control room of Real-Time transmission
protection and relay outages as described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No.
24 - Protection Outages, Settings and Coordination (OP-24) and Master Local Control
Procedure No. 7 Attachment D – Minimum Advance Notice Times – Outage Requests
for Specific Equipment (M/LCC 7D).

Within the New England transmission system, the 345 kV transmission network serves
as the bulk transmission paths for power transfer through the system. Outages that
impact this system, and its ability to transfer power, have the greatest likelihood to
impact reliability in New England

All 345 kV transmission lines in the New England Transmission System should have two
relay schemes that will clear a fault anywhere on the line with no intentional time delay

[nominally around four (4) cycles]. In general, if both high-speed protection systems are
out-of-service, a fault on the affected line would be cleared by backup relay protection or
intentionally time-delayed protection systems which usually take longer to clear faults,
possibly leading to instability, cascading outages, and system separation. It is possible
that the loss of both high-speed relay protection schemes can dynamically impose SOLs
or IROLs depending on the location of affected equipment and facilities. If a high-speed
system is out-of-service and the remaining high-speed system fails, a fault somewhere
on the line will likely not be cleared high-speed. If a 345 kV line is in-service and
energized while both high-speed relay schemes are out-of-service, and instruction or
guidance is not available for this condition, one of the following actions must be taken
within 30 minutes:

    - Return to service one of the two high-speed protection systems

    - De-energize the affected 345 kV line

De-energizing the affected 345 kV line will be the normal response to these outages.

||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|


**NOTE**

The following high-speed pilot schemes are used in New England to protect the 345 kV
lines.

Blocking schemes (e.g., Directional Comparison with Blocking Scheme - DCB) work on
the principle of the signal exchanged among all terminals during normal, no-fault or a fault
outside the protected zone condition. As long as the signal is received, the terminal will
**not clear a fault even though it is detected locally. The blocking signal will stop once a**
fault is detected within the protected zone, thus allowing the terminals to trip and clear the
fault.

The following schemes are prone to over-tripping on faults beyond the protected zone
once the communication fails.

Permissive schemes (e.g., Permissive Overreaching Transfer Trip - POTT; Directional
Comparison Underreaching Transfer Trip - DUTT) in addition to the local relay detecting
the fault require a signal (permission) from the remote terminal to trip. Without this signal,
the terminals will not trip; therefore a communication failure results in unreliable
protection of a line.

Current Differential Scheme (Current D): Relay inputs are provided from each side of a
transmission line. If the current going into the line is more than the current output, then
an internal fault is indicated.

#### I. Voltage SOL Identification Procedure

 This Procedure presents the general philosophy/method for identifying and resolving steady-state voltage limit exceedances and determining if a voltage limit exceedance is a System Operating Limit (SOL). All first contingency (N-1) voltage limit exceedances, as indicated in Contingency Analysis (CA), should be treated as potential voltage SOL exceedances. When Real-Time voltage is greater than the highest voltage limit, the condition will be considered an SOL violation. When Real-Time voltage is below the lowest voltage limit, the condition will be considered either an SOL or Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) exceedance or violation, based on the assessment in the following step 3.B.

 This function is executed while monitoring system voltage performance. Use Figure 1 below for the summary of actions to be taken. Each action is described in detail after Figure 1.

 Figure 1


#### Action Summary for Voltage Exceedance/Violation Identification/Resolution


#### 1. Identify voltage limit exceedance/violation

 2. Operator confirmation of steady-state voltage limit exceedance/violation

 3. Confirm a voltage limit exceedance/violation with applicable Transmission Operators
 (TOPs), if needed

 4. Resolve the voltage limit exceedance/violation

 5. If voltage limit exceedance cannot be resolved, the applicable Local Control Center
 (LCC)/Transmission Owner (TO) accepts the exceedance and develops an action plan

 1. Identify the voltage limit exceedance 

 A. ISO New England (ISO) or an LCC can identify the exceedance. 

 B. The exceedance can either be pre- or post-contingent identified either through
 supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) alarms or CA.

 2. Operator confirmation of the steady-state voltage limit exceedance

 A. Confirmation may include:

 (1) Separate analysis with off-line tools and/or validation of key SCADA data (i.e.
 voltage readings, unit / automatic voltage regulator (AVR) / capacitor / reactor status). 

 a. Any voltage exceedance persisting for two minutes or less is not a steady-state

#### voltage exceedance and warrants no further review

 (2) In Real-Time, determine accuracy of the voltage indication at the station. Factors to
 consider are: 

 a. M/LCC15 Attachment I - Primary and Secondary Voltage Inter-Control Center
 Communications Protocol (ICCP) IDs (MLCC15I), if the station is listed

 b. Voltage readings for other meters at the station

 c. Voltage estimated at the station from the State Estimator (SE) solution

 d. Voltage at nearby stations

 3. Confirm the voltage limit exceedance with other appropriate TOPs (if needed) 

 A. If unable to confirm between operators, then the voltage results provided by the more
 accurate / complete system model local to the exceedance can be accepted if both operators agree. If the operators are unable to agree or both operators identify a voltage limit exceedance, use the more conservative result. 

 B. If the voltage limit exceedance is confirmed, the ISO and LCC operators must
 discuss and agree on the following: 

 (1) The start time of the voltage limit exceedance

 (2) Make an initial SOL / IROL determination to apply the appropriate timer (120 or 30
 minutes) for the voltage limit exceedance

 a. A high voltage limit exceedance is an SOL

 b. A low voltage limit exceedance is: 

  Treated as an IROL, when voltage on two or more non-radial 345 kV stations
 is below 95% of nominal voltage (328 kV); or

  Treated as an IROL when transmission stations serving 500 MW or more net
 load have post-contingent voltage at or below 95% of nominal voltage on the 345 kV system, or less than 90% of nominal voltage on the 230 or 115kV systems; or

  Treated as an SOL for any other low voltage limit exceedance 

 (3) Determine what pre- and post-contingent actions are needed to resolve this
 exceedance

 (4) Determine if any enhanced voltage limits are needed to allow the use of post contingent actions (for SOLs only) 

 (5) Contact the ISO on-call engineer to obtain confirmation or correction to any low
 voltage IROL identification

#### 4. Resolve the voltage limit exceedance 

 A. If pre-contingent NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions resolve the exceedance, the
 operators will agree upon a course of action and implementation that is effective within the appropriate time period. If post-contingent actions are required, an enhanced voltage limit may be needed to allow use of the post-contingent actions.  The pre- and post-contingent actions taken to resolve the voltage limit exceedance are the action plan. 

 B. Any high voltage exceedance that can be mitigated in less than five minutes at 107%
 or less of nominal voltage (where the high limit is 105% of nominal), will not be considered a high voltage SOL exceedance.

 C. Radial Low Voltage: Radial transmission stations or stations that become radial due
 to contingencies with voltages below the low voltage limits will not be considered SOLs. 

 D. Radial High Voltage: A radial exception may also be applicable for voltages above
 the high voltage limit for:

 (1) Radials involving TO only elements. The LCC for that TO only radial can provide
 the exception. If the high voltage condition exceeds 115% of nominal, the exception must specify both the new high limit and the allowed time duration. This radial high voltage exception is to be used for Real-Time conditions or Real-Time CA (RTCA) only, and cannot be applied to operations planning study results. The only voltage criteria exceptions that can be applied to operations planning studies are those which are:

  documented in MLCC15 Attachment E Transmission System Voltage
 Criteria Exceptions (MLCC15E) or

  documented in the ISO Temporary Guide (TG) “Voltage Criteria Exceptions
 Temporary” or

  topology driven and receive TO approval as documented in the CROW
 applications. For example, based on expected system conditions, a contingency shows high voltage on the open ended side of a transformer.  However, the other side of the transformer is not experiencing high voltage and the TO either agrees that the open ended node high voltage is acceptable, or that the other end of the transformer can be opened.

 (2) Radials involving TO and non-TO owned elements, such as a generator step-up
 transformer (GSU). To be accepted, the exception must be identified and documented in either the ISO Temporary Guide (TG) “Voltage Criteria Exceptions Temporary” or MLCC15E, where the non-TO Asset owner concurrence is documented. “Voltage Criteria Exceptions Temporary” will note the facilities excepted, the new high limit for the subject facilities, and the allowed time duration.  These types of exceptions cannot be identified and used in Real-Time conditions or RTCA; these exceptions must already be identified and documented in “Voltage

#### Criteria Exceptions Temporary” or MLCC15E before the exceedance occurs.

 5. If the voltage limit exceedance cannot be resolved with NORMAL actions, perform the
 following:

 A. If confirmed as an SOL, the LCC must report the voltage exceedance to ISO. 

 B. For any low voltage limit exceedance meeting the following criteria, ISO Control
 Room staff shall perform the following actions: 

 (1) Contact the ISO on-call engineer if there is a concern for voltage collapse 

 a. The on-call engineer or Control Room System Operator can determine the
 potential for voltage collapse using the following guidelines

 (i) Voltages at or below 85% of nominal indicate potential voltage collapse and
 will be treated as though voltage collapse at each station experiencing voltage of 85% of nominal or less will occur. This means all transmission lines connected to the station should be expected to open once voltage drops to this level

 (ii) Determine if voltage collapse is possible given current operating conditions
 and the limiting contingency (or contingencies) for voltages above 85% of nominal.

 (iii) Apply the following guidelines for voltage collapse evaluation:

 (a) Voltages between 90% and 95% of nominal are acceptable and are not
 likely to lead to voltage collapse. 

 (b) Voltages between 85% and 90% of nominal indicate some potential for
 voltage collapse. The engineer accounts for system weakness which may make the area susceptible to voltage collapse at voltages within this band. If there is any question, err on the side of conservatism and assume voltage collapse will occur.

 (2) ISO informs the LCC of the potential for voltage collapse and will identify if it is a
 voltage SOL or IROL exceedance.

 6. Any Real-Time operation beyond an SOL, which occurs when operating in any
 prohibited state (e.g., Drastic Action Voltage Limit-High (DAVL-H), Drastic Action Voltage Limit-Low (DAVL-L)), in any of the voltage tables below, constitutes an SOL exceedance and will be considered an SOL violation until completion of the root cause investigation.  A technical review of the facts will be conducted prior to the determination that an SOL exceedance or violation has occurred and a root cause analysis is needed. For potential SOL low voltage and IROL violations, such determinations are made by ISO engineering staff in Operations Support Services in cooperation with the appropriate LCC staff. LCC staff, with the appropriate TOs, would lead the determinations for potential SOL high voltage violations.

#### II. Table Use Example

 The proper use of the tables in this document is important for identifying SOLs in Real-Time.  Consequently, an example explaining use of the tables is included below.

 The following definitions apply globally in the Tables: 

  “Condition” is a single word label used in the first column of each Table which contains
 the system voltage condition under examination.

  “Acceptable” and green color denote an acceptable system voltage condition for which
 the operator does not need to take immediate action to change or alter. Any of the emergency voltage conditions, on the other hand, do require operator action to return the system voltage condition to “Acceptable”.

  An “Action Plan” may include both pre- and post-contingency actions. The “Action
 Plan” does not need to include any pre-contingency actions. The actions included must be able to be performed in the allowed time period for the voltage limit in question.

  The second column label in each Table uses the single word “Voltage” to describe the
 voltage assessment condition to determine which system voltage condition is the correct choice for the specific voltages (Real-Time and contingency) under examination. The voltage assessment conditions are set-up so that for any given voltage, only one system voltage condition can be true.

  Table Notes that apply globally to the Table are assigned to the Table title. This
 means that the notes are applicable to all conditions captured in the Table, i.e., each row. In other words, these notes are applicable during all potential operating conditions.

 In this example, Table 1 will be used. This table is for 115 kV facilities operated by CONVEX and owned by Eversource. The example will focus on the SOL table. For the purposes of this example, the following voltage information is true:

  A non-radial Eversource 115 kV station has a voltage of 116 kV in Real-Time

  CA shows the same Eversource 115 kV station has identified a potential low voltage
 condition of 104 kV

 For the “Real-Time” voltage, according to Table 1, the 116 kV station voltage has a Condition of “Acceptable” because the voltage falls within the defined upper and lower limits of the Acceptable Condition of 121 and 105 kV, respectively. The lowest contingency voltage determined, however, does not fall within the “Acceptable” Condition. This condition does not meet the IROL criteria defined in 3.B.2. above, therefore the lower half of the SOL portion of Table 1 is applicable. For CA, the 104 kV contingency voltage condition is less than 105 kV, but above 102 kV, meaning that the contingency condition is Long Time Emergency Voltage Limit – Low (LTEVL-L). Per the table, the operator has 120 minutes to either take action to mitigate the low voltage condition or develop an Action Plan to resolve the issue post-contingency, per Note 2.

### LCC Voltage Limit Operator Aid Tables Legend

#### Table Key :


#### Can remain in this state indefinitely


#### Can remain in this state at least a period of time, and potentially indefinitely if an Action Plan is developed and the pre-contingent portion is executed Cannot remain in this state - An Action Plan is needed and must be executed to leave this state Staying in this state can result in an SOL / IROL exceedance This state is prohibited - Cannot remain in this state - Must take immediate action to leave this state for an acceptable one – Being in this state may result in an SOL / IROL

 Table Notes:

 Note 1 : Voltage Limits and associated timelines may not be applicable on radial transmission
 stations (radial either by design or the result of a contingency). See Section 4.C & 4.D
 Note 2 : Presumes an Action Plan will restore voltage to system voltage limits within allowed time
 durations post-contingency.
 Note 3 : An Action Plan to resolve the IROL based upon load shedding is needed to allow operation in
 this state. Non-load shedding plans are also allowed if effective. All plans must be able to be completed as soon as possible and well within the allowed time period.
 Note 4 : All NORMAL actions should be taken to return voltage within the NORMAL Low and High
 voltage limits shown in OP-19 Transmission Operations, Appendix K Operating Voltage Limits by LCC (OP-19K).
 Note 5 : These limits are to be applied after any local protection and automatic control action 
 (i.e., includes but not limited to; shunt devices, transformer load tap changer (LTC) step changes, etc.)
 Note 6 : Conditions where RTCA indicates voltages > 105% and ≤ 107% per unit (p.u.) may be
 permitted if they can be mitigated in < five minutes post-contingency; if so, the time allowed in this state is “Indefinite”. This exception may only be invoked in Real-Time.
 Note 7 : Voltage Limits and associated timelines may not be applicable if determined to not be an
 IROL per Section 3.B.2.b.

# 2. Background

The intent of Master/Local Control Center No. 13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices
(M/LCC 13) is to establish common ISO New England (ISO) and Local Control Center (LCC)
communication protocols and practices to promote effective communication especially
between the operating personnel of ISO and each LCC. North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard COM-001 - Communications and NERC Reliability
Standard COM-002 - Operating Personnel Communications Protocols establish
requirements for effective communications; NERC Reliability Standard TOP-001 Transmission Operations establishes the requirement to comply with Operating Instructions
from the Transmission Operator (TOP).

ISO and each LCC have internal communication procedures that are already established,
however M/LCC 13 is intended to supplement those procedures and provide specific
guidance for communications practices for ISO and LCCs.

# 3. Responsibilities

ISO and each LCC are responsible for precise, accurate, and professional
communications involving collaborative efforts to meet NERC TOP requirements as set
forth in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 12 - Identification and Coordination of
ISO and LCC TOP Responsibilities (M/LCC 12).

ISO and each LCC are responsible for gathering and providing complete and accurate
information during operational communications. This can be accomplished through verbal
or electronic Inter Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) telemetry. In the case
of SOL and IROL Interface exceedances, ICCP will be used to confirm when an
exceedance occurs and when it is cleared.

||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|


**NOTE**

Using three-part communication is required whenever issuing an Operating Instruction.
Communications conducted for the purpose of confirming Interchange Schedules are not
considered Operating Instructions, however, the use of three-part communications is
expected. It is considered a best practice to use three-part communication in all situations
where its use will enhance communication.

NERC defines an Operating Instruction as “A command by operating personnel responsible
for the Real-time operation of the interconnected Bulk Electric System to change or preserve
the state, status, output, or input of an Element of the Bulk Electric System or Facility of the
Bulk Electric System (A discussion of general information and of potential options or
alternatives to resolve Bulk Electric System operating concerns is not a command and is not
considered an Operating Instruction).” For the purposes of this procedure and other ISO and
LCC procedures, the term “Operating Instruction” is consistent with the NERC definition of
this term. Also, the terms “Operating Instruction” and “directive” as used in ISO and LCC
procedures are considered to be equivalent terms.

ISO and each LCC are responsible for using three-part communication whenever a
verbal Operating Instruction is issued.

The M/LCC Heads are responsible for reviewing M/LCC 13 to assess the effectiveness of
M/LCC 13 communications protocols and for modifying those protocols, as necessary, to
enhance their effectiveness.

# 4. Procedure

**4.1** **Basic Protocol for All Operational Communications**

**NOTE**

The initial communication each shift between ISO and each LCC and between ISO and each
Reliability Coordinator (RC) requires stating names and locations. For subsequent
communication during the shift between ISO and each LCC and between ISO and each RC,
it is acceptable to state names only.

Verbal communication is extremely important and the primary method by which the ISO and
LCC System Operators provide and receive information.

A. ISO and LCC System Operators verbal communications shall make use of the following

standard practices:

     - English language shall be used when issuing or receiving an Operating Instruction.

     - Identify yourself, including your name and location.
```
      o For ISO System Operators include your assigned desk (e.g., Loader, Generation,

```
Senior, etc.)

     - Separate the conversational portion of a discussion from the portion when an

Operating Instruction is being issued.

     - Be precise, accurate, and professional.

     - Be proactive rather than reactive in communications.

     - Limit all unnecessary distractions that could hamper good communications.

     - Be free of ambiguity. Avoid the use of slang terms and words that have a similar

sound. Use correct nomenclature for any devices mentioned.

     - Be direct. Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid technical terms and

acronyms. Be aware that technical terms, jargon, and acronyms may be confusing
and meaningless to people with backgrounds and experience different from your own.

     - Make every effort to provide clear communications and intentions that are understood

completely. Listen to cues from the other party to gauge their interest in and
understanding of your comments. If the other party sounds confused or distracted,
stop speaking and make sure the conversation is on track. If there is a concern of
misunderstanding or confusion, stop the evolution and resolve the concerns.

     - Communications with team members shall be concise and prioritized such that urgent

or high consequence information is conveyed with minimum distraction and delay.

  - If a request for information is received, obtain the information and promptly

communicate it back to the party or provide the party with a knowledgeable contact.

B. After an exchange of general operational information, the discussion shall be summarized

and acknowledged by the receiver by repeating back enough information in summary so
that the issuer knows the issued message was correctly received.

**NOTE**

ISO and LCC System Operators should use 24-hour clock time when issuing an Operating
Instruction with a time identification.

**NOTE**

ISO and LCCs do not issue Operating Instructions to any entity outside of the New
England Reliability Control Area (RCA). All Operating Instructions issued by ISO and
LCCs are to entities within the New England RCA time zone, so there are no instances
that would require time zone identification when an Operating Instruction is issued.
However, time zone identification should be used whenever it adds clarity to a discussion.

C. ISO and LCC System Operators shall issue each Operating Instruction in a clear, concise

and definitive manner and use three-part communication, taking one of the following
actions whenever such Operating Instruction is issued:

  - If the repeated information is correct, confirm the receiver’s response.

  - If the repeated information is wrong or if requested by the receiver, reissue the original

Operating Instruction.

  - If a response is not received or if the Operating Instruction was not understood by the

receiver, take an alternative action.

D. When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction, the LCC System

Operator shall perform one of the following actions:

  - Repeat, not necessarily verbatim, the Operating Instruction and receive confirmation

from the issuer that your response was correct.

  - Request that the issuer restate the Operating Instruction.

E. When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction from ISO, the LCC

shall comply with the Operating Instruction, or if not able to perform the Operating
Instruction, the LCC shall immediately inform ISO it cannot perform the required action

F. When an ISO System Operator receives a verbal request to take action from an RC or an

LCC, the ISO System Operator is expected to follow three-part communication protocol
and perform the requested action, subject to due consideration of the reliability of the
New England transmission system.

G. When an ISO System Operator issues a verbal request to a neighboring RC to take

action, the ISO System Operator is expected to follow three-part communication protocol.

**NOTE**

The nomenclature for transmission interface elements and transmission interface
facilities can be found in the ISO Interface Limit Calculator (ILC) or in the Generic
Interface Constraints document on the ISO-NE website found at:
[https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/pricing/-/tree/pricing-support-documents](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/pricing/-/tree/pricing-support-documents)

H. The nomenclature for transmission interface elements and transmission interface facilities

shall include the following:

  - For a line with two terminals, use the line number identifier

  - For a line with more than two terminals, use the line number identifier and substation

**NOTE**

A single-party to multiple-party burst messaging system is used for notifying or
communicating, by electronic means, a common message to multiple parties in a short
period of time. Although such systems could be used to issue a verbal or written
Operating Instruction, they are not used for that purpose by ISO and typically not used
for that purpose by the LCCs. However, NERC Reliability Standard COM-002 requires
that communications protocols for operating personnel require that whenever an
Operating Instruction is issued using a burst messaging system that the issuer confirm
or verify that the Operating Instruction was received by at least one receiver of the
Operating Instruction.

ISO/LCC “All LCC” conference calls are treated as a series of two-person
communications requiring repeat-backs from each recipient.

I. If an LCC System Operator issues an Operating Instruction using a single-party to

multiple-party burst messaging system, the issuer shall confirm or verify that the
Operating Instruction was received by at least one of the receiving parties.

**4.3** **ISO and LCC Communications During Abnormal Conditions**

**NOTE**

The term “Emergency” may be used during operational communications to convey a sense
of urgency to the intended recipient. The use of the term “Emergency” is not indicative of the
existence of OP-19 Emergency Conditions, a reduction of overall system reliability, or the
existence of an “Operating Emergency” as defined in Section 4.5 ISO and LCC
Communications During Operating Emergencies.

**4.4** **ISO and LCC Communications During Transmission Events**

**NOTE**

When a decision results in a plan to implement any Operating Instruction that is time
dependent to restore OP-19 criteria, the Operating Instruction for that plan should be
implemented and changes to that plan should be avoided.

**NOTE**

When an event involves more than one LCC, a conference call among all involved parties is
recommended, if time allows. The discussion should include event evaluation, system status
and the plan for any Operating Instruction implementation.

**NOTE**

When the ISO and LCC System Operators encounter modeling or solution discrepancies
discovered during RTA discussions, the System Operators shall inform their respective
Power System Modeling teams to conduct a verification of EMS solutions and to resolve
discrepancies identified for both the pre- and post-contingency states.

**NOTE**

The term “Emergency” may be used during operational communications to convey a
sense of urgency to the intended recipient. The use of the term “Emergency” is not
indicative of the existence of OP-19 Emergency Conditions, a reduction of overall system
reliability, or the existence of an “Operating Emergency” as defined in Section 4.5 ISO
and LCC Communications During Operating Emergencies.

_4.4.1 Exceedance of an Operating Limit in Real-Time_

**4.5** **ISO and LCC Communications During Operating Emergencies**

**NOTE**

The term “Operating Emergency” as defined in the Table below and as used in ISO and LCC
procedures fully encompasses the NERC terms “Emergency”, “BES Emergency”, “Capacity
Emergency” and “Energy Emergency” defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC
Reliability Standards. An Operating Emergency exists on the New England BES when one
or more of the specific set of conditions listed in the Table below occurs. ISO and the LCCs
have determined that these conditions align with these NERC “Emergency” terms. NERC
defines “Emergency” as “any abnormal system condition that requires automatic or
immediate manual action to prevent or limit the failure of transmission facilities or generation
supply that could adversely affect the reliability of the Bulk Electric System”.

NERC Reliability Standard COM-002 requires that ISO and LCC communications protocols
require that three-part communication be used when issuing or receiving Operating
Instructions. While Section 4.1 above describes these protocols, the protocols are repeated
in this Section because it is especially important that ISO and LCC System Operators adhere
to three-part communication protocols during Operating Emergencies. NERC Reliability
Standard COM-002 has “zero tolerance” for failures to adhere to three-part communication
protocols during Operating Emergencies.

A. The following table identifies the ISO/LCC criteria that define when an Operating

Emergency begins and ends on the New England BES. If ISO or an LCC determines that
the current system condition as listed in the “Point at which Operating Emergency
Begins” column has been reached, ISO and the LCC shall follow the communication
requirements in the following steps until the conditions in the “Point at which Operating
Emergency Ends” have been reached.


**Point at which Operating Emergency**


Any Real-Time exceedance of a thermal or Real-Time IROL exceedance ended
voltage Short Time Emergency (STE) IROL

An IROL exceedance [Real Time Contingency IROL exceedance ended
Analysis (RTCA) or interface] for period greater
than 20 minutes (must resolve in 30 min.)

OP-4 Action 6 or greater implemented* The last of implemented OP-4 Actions 6 or
greater are cancelled

Load shed Operating Instruction issued Load shed has mitigated the Operating
Emergency.

 - If Action 10 or 11 is implemented at a time prior to an actual capacity deficiency or transmission reliability issue or

extended beyond an actual capacity deficiency or transmission reliability issue (e.g., extended heatwave), ISO or the
applicable LCC is not considered to be in an Operating Emergency until the time that the actual capacity deficiency or
transmission reliability issue occurs (which will be the point at which the Operating Emergency begins) and will remain in
the Operating Emergency until implemented OP-4 Actions 6 or greater are cancelled (which will be the point at which the
Operating Emergency ends).

|Point at which Operating Emergency Begins|Point at which Operating Emergency Ends|
|---|---|
|Any Real-Time exceedance of a thermal or voltage Short Time Emergency (STE) IROL|Real-Time IROL exceedance ended|
|An IROL exceedance [Real Time Contingency Analysis (RTCA) or interface] for period greater than 20 minutes (must resolve in 30 min.)|IROL exceedance ended|
|OP-4 Action 6 or greater implemented*|The last of implemented OP-4 Actions 6 or greater are cancelled|
|Load shed Operating Instruction issued|Load shed has mitigated the Operating Emergency.|

||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|


**NOTE**

For any OP-4 implementation of Action 6 or greater by an individual LCC to deal with local
conditions, that individual LCC and ISO would be considered to be in an Operating
Emergency, but the other LCCs would not be in an Operating Emergency.

**NOTE**

OP-4 provides the specific messages that are to be used when communicating OP-4
Action Steps.

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7) provides
the specific messages to be used when communicating OP-7 actions.

Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 4 - Emergency Load Reduction Plans for
Mitigating IROL Violations (M/LCC 4) provides specific messages to be used when
communicating verbal Operating Instructions to the LCC for load shed to alleviate an
IROL contingency.

A single-party to multiple-party burst messaging system is typically not used by ISO or an
LCC to issue an Operating Instruction during an Operating Emergency (or any other time),
but if it ever is used for that purpose, confirmation of receipt by at least one receiver is
required.

ISO and LCC System Operators shall issue each Operating Instruction during an
Operating Emergency (excluding single-party to multiple-party burst Operating
Instructions) in a clear, concise and definitive manner and use three-part communication,
taking one of the following actions whenever such Operating Instruction is issued:

  - If the repeated information is correct confirm the receiver's response.

  - If the repeated information is wrong or if requested by the receiver, reissue the original

Operating Instruction.

  - If a response is not received or if the Operating Instruction was not understood by the

receiver, take an alternative action.

When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction during an Operating
Emergency (excluding single-party to multiple-party burst Operating Instructions) the LCC
System Operator shall perform one of the following actions:

  - Repeat, not necessarily verbatim, the Operating Instruction and receive confirmation

from the issuer that your response was correct.

  - Request that the issuer restate the Operating Instruction.

**NOTE**

Although a single-party to multiple-party burst messaging system could be used to issue a
verbal or written Operating Instruction, it is not used for that purpose by ISO and typically
**not used for that purpose by the LCCs.**

When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction from ISO during an
Operating Emergency:

(1) The LCC System Operator shall comply with the Operating Instruction, or if not able

to perform the Operating Instruction, the LCC System Operator shall immediately
inform the ISO System Operator it cannot perform the required action.

(2) When the LCC System Operator has completed the applicable action for the

Operating Instruction, the LCC System Operator shall report back to the ISO System
Operator that they have performed the required action.

If an LCC System Operator issues an Operating Instruction using a single-party to
multiple-party burst messaging system during an Operating Emergency, the issuer must
confirm or verify that the Operating Instruction was received by at least one of the
receiving parties.

If load shed is required in one (or more) LCC area(s), ISO shall:

(1) Activate Loadshed Notification for applicable LCCs

(2) Issue the load shed Operating Instruction to applicable LCCs

(3) Immediately notify each remaining unaffected LCC

If an LCC is experiencing an Operating Emergency within its LCC area, the LCC shall
promptly inform ISO of its current and projected system conditions.

An LCC shall inform the following entities if its actual or expected operations result in, or
could result in, an Operating Emergency and when that condition has ended:

  - ISO

  - Known impacted other LCCs, if ISO is unable to perform these communications.

  - Known impacted other TOPs with which they are synchronously interconnected that

are located in adjacent RCAs and that are not also an RC/BA (ISO makes
notifications to affected TOPs that are RCs/BAs, as described in 4.5.9, below)

  - Generators, if being dispatched by the LCC to correct the Operating Emergency.

If ISO is experiencing, or receives a notification from an LCC of an actual or expected
Operating Emergency, ISO shall:

  - Notify the following entities of the existence of an Operating Emergency and the end

required to perform a Real-time Assessment (RTA) for their applicable area of
responsibility at least once every 30 minutes. This RTA is an evaluation of system
conditions using Real-time data to assess existing (pre-Contingency) and potential (postContingency) operating conditions. The assessment shall reflect applicable inputs
including, but not limited to: load, generation output levels, known Protection System and
RAS/ACS status or degradation, Transmission outages, generator outages, Interchange,
Facility Ratings, and identified phase angle and equipment limitations. (RTAs may be
provided through internal systems or through third-party services.)

RTAs are inherently dependent on data and telemetry systems, such as SCADA and
ICCP, as well as EMS systems, such as State Estimator (SE), Contingency Analysis
(CA), and Powerflow. If, at any point, ISO or an LCC believes they will be unable to
perform a RTA within 30 minutes, they shall make appropriate notifications and take
actions so that another entity is requested to perform a RTA on their behalf within that
period.

A. When an LCC becomes aware of an unplanned interruption of telemetering and control

equipment or a persistent failure of their SE, CA, or other systems affecting its ability to
perform a RTA at least once every 30 minutes, the LCC System Operator shall contact
the ISO System Operator and perform the following:

(1) Provide the following information:

a. Estimated start time of the failure

b. Cause of the failure, if known

c. Time of completion of last RTA

d. Expected duration of failure, if known

(2) Request ISO to perform a RTA and continue to perform a RTA on their behalf at

least once every 30 minutes for the duration of the failure.

B. When ISO becomes aware of an unplanned interruption of telemetering and control

equipment or a persistent failure of their SE, CA, or other systems affecting its ability to
perform a RTA at least once every 30 minutes, the ISO System Operator shall complete
the following:

(1) Contact LCCs and perform the following:

a. Provide the following information:

(i) Estimated start time of the failure

**4.9** **Assess Effectiveness and Modify M/LCC 13 Communications Protocols**

**NOTE**

If the annual review of M/LCC 13 by the M/LCC Heads does not result in any changes to
the communication protocols, it is because the M/LCC Heads have determined that the
M/LCC 13 communication protocols continue to be effective; this determination shall be
noted in the revision history.

Whenever a change to the M/LCC 13 communication protocols is made, the reason(s) for
the change should be explained with sufficient detail in the revision history, including a
brief description of how the change enhanced the effectiveness of the communication
protocols, as applicable.

A. At least once every 12 calendar months, the M/LCC Heads will review and assess

M/LCC 13 communication protocols for their effectiveness for System Operators that
issue and receive Operating Instructions and, as necessary, modify the M/LCC 13
communication protocols to enhance their effectiveness.

     - In the M/LCC Heads assessment of the effectiveness of these protocols, the M/LCC

Heads may consider, among other factors, the following:

(1) Feedback from their respective training departments regarding training related to

M/LCC 13 communications protocols

(2) Assessments conducted by each respective company of their System Operator

adherence to M/LCC 13 communications protocols

## 1. Objectives

This procedure is intended to assist the System Restoration Working Group (SRWG)
in calculating an approximate desired MW amount of Designated Blackstart
Resources (DBRs) for the overall New England System Restoration Plan (the Plan).
It also serves to aid in decisions about adding new DBRs based on interconnection
voltage levels, as well as replacement of existing DBRs that may be at-risk due to
Resource age. The method employed in this Attachment is not intended to replace
any study requirements pertaining to DBRs, but rather to provide tools for the SRWG
to broadly quantify a desired target amount of DBR MW for the Plan and to assist in
identifying potential areas of the Plan where it may be beneficial to add or remove
DBRs.

## 2. Responsibilities

The SRWG will use the methods found in this Attachment to assist in evaluating
whether the number, size, location and diversity of DBRs are sufficient to meet the
needs of the Plan.

The SRWG will use the methods found in this Attachment to assist in determining
whether a prospective DBR would be advantageous to the existing Plan.

## 3. Calculation of Overall New England DBR MW Target

A. The SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine the DBR MW target using the

following calculation:

1. Determine the total number of Generator Assets with a cold startup +

notification of more than 30 minutes and less than or equal to 4 hours.

**NOTE**

In Step 2, the value of 10 represents average station service load in MW.

2. Multiply the value from Step 1 by 10.

3. Determine the total number of nuclear power stations in New England.

**NOTE**

In Step 4, the value of 20 represents average station service load in MW.

4. Multiply the value from Step 3 by 20.

**NOTE**

In Step 5, multiplying by 1.2 provides a 20% outage factor for New England DBRs.

5. Add the value from Step 2 to the value from Step 4 and multiply by (1.2).

**NOTE**

In Step 6, Summer Seasonal Claimed Capability (S-SCC) MW values for nonhydro DBRs should be obtained from the most recently published Forecast Report
of Capacity, Energy, Loads, and Transmission (CELT Report). Non-hydro DBRs
that have been in-service at least 35 years are classified as “at-risk” from market,
material, or environmental forces.

6. Determine the total Summer Seasonal Claimed Capability (S-SCC) of non
hydro DBRs which have been in-service at least 35 years.

**NOTE**

In Step 7, the value is a target value for DBR MWs in New England. The SRWG
will ultimately determine whether the exact amount of DBR MWs of the fleet is
sufficient to meet the goals of the Plan.

7. Add the value from Step 5 to the value from Step 6.

8. Determine the total MVA Nameplate of all DBRs.

**NOTE**

In Step 9, multiplying by 0.8 provides a DBR MW total assuming 0.8 pf.

9. Multiply the value from Step 8 by 0.8.

10. Compare the value from Step 7 to the value of Step 9.

11. Evaluate whether DBRs should be added to or removed from the Plan based

upon the comparison from Step 10.

**Target DBR MWs = [(# Generator Assets with Cold Startup between 30 minutes and 4 hours)*10**

**MW+(# Nuclear power stations)*20 MW]*1.2 + (S-SCC of non-hydro DBRs >=35 years old)**

## 4. Consideration of DBR Interconnection Voltage

**NOTE**

The DBR Voltage Point Target range is 36-42 points based upon 6-7 system
restoration islands. Two (2) DBRs per island at 345 kV is optimal.

A preference for DBRs interconnected at higher voltages was previously established in
the SRWG Optimal Blackstart Assessment Study conducted in 2009. This study
determined that a “top-down” approach, with DBRs connecting at higher voltages,
would be more efficient for achieving the Plan objectives. To reflect this, and the
recent commissioning of several new DBRs interconnecting at 115 kV into the Plan,
the SRWG’s evaluation of whether DBRs should be added or removed from the Plan,
shall use the following voltage point values in the calculations described below:

**DBR interconnection voltage** **Voltage Point Value**

345kV and 115kV 3

230kV 2

All other 1

A. The SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine the total voltage point value of the

DBR fleet using the following calculation:

1. Determine the interconnection voltage of each DBR.

2. Determine the electrical substation to which each DBR is connected.

3. Remove from the calculation all but one DBR at each electrical substation

connected at the same voltage level (i.e., if two DBRs connect at the same
substation bus, only one DBR should be counted in the point calculation;
however, two DBRs interconnected at different voltage levels at the same
substation would each be counted in the point value calculation)

4. Multiply each DBR remaining by the appropriate point value shown in the table

above.

5. Add the point values from Step 4.

6. Compare the point total from Step 5 to the DBR Voltage Point Target range of

36-42 points.

7. Evaluate whether DBRs should be added to or removed from the Plan.

## 5. Identification of At-Risk Local Areas

The SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine if any local areas of the Plan are at risk
by:

1. Accessing the most recently published Forecast Report of Capacity, Energy,

Loads, and Transmission (CELT Report).

2. Determining whether removing all at-risk (described above in Section 3,

Step 6) DBRs from a path compromises completion of that path’s objectives.

3. Evaluating whether DBRs should be added to the Plan to enhance a local area

of the Plan that could be compromised by DBR’s identified to be at-risk.

||Review Due Date: May 20, 2026|

   - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards

  - Transmission Operating Agreements

(OP-1A)

**2.** **Background**

**2.1 M/LCC Heads Charter**

Section 4 of this document contains the Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC)
Heads Charter, which summarizes the responsibilities and activities of the group
comprised of the entities registered as Transmission Operators (TOPs) in New
England. These TOP entities include ISO New England (ISO), which serves as the
Master Control Center (MCC), and each of the Local Control Centers (LCCs). This
group was established to share information, identify and resolve operational issues
and help coordinate the reliable operation of the New England transmission system.

**2.2 TOP Responsibilities Matrix**

Section 5 of this document establishes the process for delineating the
responsibilities of ISO and the LCCs for compliance with tasks that pertain to North
American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards
Requirements applicable to the TOP function. Under the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC)-approved Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) structure
for New England, certain New England entities play a role in performing some but
**not all of the tasks associated with the TOP function for which they are registered.**

The delineation of responsibilities between ISO and LCCs with regard to system
operations is governed by an important principle. ISO has ultimate authority for the
Real-Time operation of the New England Transmission System as reflected in the
FERC-approved Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA) at Section 3.02(d). To
the extent there is any disagreement between ISO and an LCC during Real-Time
system conditions, ISO judgment ultimately prevails, thus maintaining a “one set of
hands on the wheel” philosophy in system operations that is also reflected in ISO
Operating Procedures (OPs). Of course, when ISO and LCCs confer on operating
decisions, the more conservative approach to maintaining system reliability
consistent with FERC-approved rules is always respected. In this manner, the
execution of TOP tasks between ISO and LCCs as specified in their procedures is
carried out in a highly reliable manner. The delineation of TOP responsibilities

reflects the fact that ISO, as the RTO, has the ultimate oversight and governing
documentation for many of these tasks that are performed jointly by ISO and the
LCCs. ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1, Central Dispatch Operating
Responsibilities and Authority (OP-1) and the associated OP-1 Attachment A Assignment of Responsibilities (OP-1 A) are the governing ISO New England
Operating Documents that discuss the operational relationships that are employed
within the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area
(RCA/BAA).

**3.** **Responsibilities**

1. ISO and the LCCs are responsible for meeting the responsibilities and

performing the actions described in Section 4 of this document.

2. ISO and the LCCs are jointly responsible for establishing and updating a TOP

Responsibilities Matrix that delineates the responsibilities of ISO and the LCCs
with respect to the Requirement(s) of each NERC Reliability Standard
applicable to TOPs.[1]

3. The ISO Reliability & Operations Compliance (ROC) business unit is responsible

for primary maintenance of the TOP Responsibilities Matrix, developing
proposed updates to reflect new/revised NERC Reliability Standards or
revisions for other reasons, as necessary, distributing the document to the
M/LCC Heads for review and approval, and for verifying that the approved
document is posted on the Satellite website.

4. ISO and the LCCs are responsible for reviewing the TOP Responsibilities Matrix

on an annual basis to discuss and delineate responsibilities for new or revised
NERC Reliability Standards Requirements applicable to TOPs or to discuss any
other matters pertaining to the document that may be raised by ISO or an LCC.

5. When there is a change in the membership of the Heads group, the M/LCC

Heads Chair is responsible for updating the following ISO email distribution lists:
“M S Head Only” and “M S Heads Full Distribution List”.

1 The TOP Responsibilities Matrix, which is part of the broader “Assignment of NERC Reliability Standard

Responsibilities for TOP, TP and TSP Functions in New England” spreadsheet file, is posted on the Satellite
website, with a filter applied to show only the NERC Requirements applicable to the TOP. The Revision History
Worksheet within the file documents the approvals of revisions to this file.

# 1. References

ISO New England Manual for Market Operations, Manual M-11 (Manual-11)

ISO New England Manual for Definitions and Abbreviations, Manual M-35 (Manual-35)

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators,
Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology
Regulation Resources (OP-14)

# 2. Purpose

This procedure establishes a methodology for each Generator Designated Entity (DE) and
ISO New England (ISO) to communicate the status of a Generator governor by ensuring
that a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor is reported to ISO. This reporting
will allow ISO to ensure the continued reliable operation of the Bulk Electric System (BES).

# 3. Introduction

ISO requires Generator governor performance characteristic reporting and tracking,
specifically for the purpose of maintaining the capability of Generators to support control of
system frequency during a BES disturbance.

# 4. Definitions

**Governors: - For the purposes of this procedure a “functioning governor” includes**

hardware or software that provides autonomous frequency-responsive power control.

**Governors Free To Respond: - Turbine governors and HVDC controls, where applicable,**

should be able to respond to system frequency deviation, unless there is a temporary
operating problem.

# 5. Applicability

This procedure applies to all Generators of ten (10) megawatts net output or greater that
are equipped with governors operational for frequency response per ISO New England
Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response
Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources
(OP-14).

# 6. Procedure

**NOTE**

A Generator that does not meet OP-14 criteria and that has been granted an exemption
by ISO is listed in Attachment A - Generators Exempted from Governor Requirements.
Generators listed in Attachment A are not required to meet the governor criteria in OP-14.

1. When reporting a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor, the Generator DE

performs the following:

**NOTE**

The term “Redeclaration’ used in this procedure is defined in ISO New England Manual
for Definitions and Manual M-35 (Manual 35) as “A restatement of a Resource’s
availability, limits, or other Offer Data, except price, submitted by a Market Participant to
the ISO to reflect a change in the status or capability of the Resource or changed by the
ISO based upon the Resource’s actual performance.”

A. If applicable, submit a Redeclaration, per ISO New England Manual for Market

Operations, Manual M-11 (Manual-11) indicating the Generator output is restricted,
the level of restriction, and that this restriction is due to a non-functioning or blocked
Generator governor control.

B. If the non-functioning or blocked Generator governor does not impact Generator

performance (i.e. no Redeclaration to Eco Max or MRR is required), directly report
the Generator governor status to the ISO Control Room.

C. Project the expected return-to-service time and date.

2. When the Generator governor problem no longer exists, the Generator DE performs

the following:

A. If applicable, request removal of the Redeclaration, per Manual-11, indicating that

the Generator output is no longer restricted.

B. If a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor did not impact Generator

performance (i.e., no Redeclaration to Eco Max or MRR was required), directly
report to the ISO Control Room that the Generator governor is now functioning
properly.

3. When notified of a Generator governor problem, ISO Control Room Staff performs the

following :

A. If the non-functioning governor restricts Generator performance capabilities, accept

the Generator Redeclaration.

B. Enter the date, time, reason, and Generator name in the Control Room Event

Logserver.

C. Create an application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software to track each non
functioning or blocked Generator governor.

D. Notify the applicable Local Control Center (LCC) of the non-functioning or blocked

Generator governor.

4. Upon notification that a Generator is no longer operating with a non-functioning or

blocked Generator governor, ISO Control Room Staff performs the following :

A. Remove the Generator Redeclaration indicating that the Generator output is no

longer restricted (if applicable).

B. Enter the return-to-service date and time in the Control Room Event Logserver.

C. Complete the application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software used to track each

non-functioning or blocked Generator governor.

D. Notify the applicable LCC that the Generator governor is now functional.

# 7. Logging Requirements

All Control Room Event Logserver entries, as created in Section 6 of this procedure, are
retained for a minimum period of 12 rolling months.

# 2. Purpose

This procedure defines the processes and responsibilities for maintaining and verifying the
adequacy of the New England System Restoration Plan (the Plan) to reestablish the New
England Bulk Electric System (BES) in a stable and orderly manner following a partial or total
shutdown of the New England BES. The New England BES generally consists of facilities
operated at 100 kV or higher. The Plan is described in Master/Local Control Center Procedure
No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan (M/LCC 18) and the related M/LCC 18
Attachments. ISO exercises its authority and responsibility to coordinate and promote the
reliability of the Plan in accordance with this procedure and with applicable North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard Requirements and Northeast Power
Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) criteria. The Plan is the single New England regional system
restoration plan that serves as both:

   - the Transmission Operator (TOP) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-005) and

    - the Reliability Coordinator (RC) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-006).

**NOTE**

These same M/LCC 18 documents also serve as the TOP restoration plan for

each Local Control Center (LCC).

The Plan is maintained in accordance with the Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA)
between ISO and New England Transmission Owners (TOs) and in consultation with the TOPs
that serve as LCCs. The Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC) Heads have created the
System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) and assigned to it responsibility for certain tasks
with respect to maintaining, verifying and coordinating the Plan. The SRWG membership is
comprised of TOs, including representatives from each LCC and ISO (with an ISO staff
member serving as SRWG Chair). ISO and LCC responsibilities for maintaining and verifying
the adequacy of the Plan are generally met by the SRWG, which reports to the M/LCC Heads.
Section 4 documents the responsibilities of SRWG members. Attachment F contains the
System Restoration Working Group Charter.

The Plan is evaluated by the SRWG through a combination of computer model simulations and
system restoration exercises that verify that the Plan accomplishes its intended function of
restoring the New England BES following a partial or total shutdown of the electric system. The
SRWG also provides input to the Joint Trainers Task Force (JTTF) regarding formal annual
System Restoration Plan Training exercises and the M/LCC Training Simulator Model used. In
accordance with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No.17 - ISO and Local Control Center
Training (M/LCC 17), ISO and the LCCs jointly develop Training for ISO and LCC operations
training organizations. Depending on the scope of Training, ISO may request that one or more
TOPs, Generator Operators (GOPs) or other entities owning facilities identified in the Plan
participate in the simulation exercises that may be a part of the Training.

# 3. Background

**3.1 The Purpose and Characteristics of the Plan**

The Plan is designed to restore the New England BES in the event of a partial or total
shutdown of the New England BES. The Plan is comprised of Primary and Alternate
Paths to nuclear power stations and also includes restoration strategies designed to
achieve the objectives of regional restoration when other system restoration paths are
unavailable. From the RC perspective, the Plan ends when the following objectives are
achieved:

1) Provide off-site ac power to the New England nuclear power stations

2) Interconnect all New England TOPs (i.e., the LCCs)

3) Establish interconnections/synchronizations with contiguous Reliability Coordinator

Areas (RCAs) that are normally synchronously connected to the New England
RCA, advancing system restoration of the Eastern Interconnection

When these three objectives have been achieved and, in accordance with EOP-005, the
choice of the next load to be restored is not driven by the need to control frequency or
voltage, implementation of the Plan shall be considered to have been completed. ISO
recognizes that, upon completion of the Plan, LCC local recovery actions may still be
ongoing for the energization of remaining New England load. The local area recovery
actions of each LCC are documented in their respective Local Area Recovery Instructions
(LARIs), which are not part of the Plan. As necessary, ISO will continue to coordinate with
each LCC when restoring load to remaining areas of New England, while each LCC
implements its respective LARIs.1

The Plan is designed to establish procedures and provide the facilities and personnel
necessary to enable system restoration from certain Designated Blackstart Resources
(DBRs) that are part of the Plan and to maintain reliability and resiliency during system
restoration. DBRs are blackstart Generators that receive compensation for providing
Blackstart Service under Schedule 16 - Blackstart Service (Schedule 16) of the ISO New
England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section II - Open Access
Transmission Tariff (OATT). DBRs are listed in M/LCC 18, Attachment O - Designated
Blackstart Resources (M/LCC 18O) (Confidential). M/LCC 18, Attachment A - System
Restoration Flowchart (M/LCC 18A) (Confidential) documents each facility and element
comprising each cranking path from each DBR to the Generator(s) to be started. M/LCC
18A also includes a listing of each group of elements meeting the initial transmission lineswitching operations requirements from an operating DBR up to and including the first
interconnection/synchronization point of the starting station service of the next generation

1 Energizations of Defense Critical Electric Infrastructure (DCEI) facilities is a top priority for Transmission Owners (TOs) and the TO should

align recovery of these facilities with the restoration of load to support the Plan objectives. Restoration of DCEI facilities should not conflict
with the Plan objectives. When possible, DCEI facilities should be excluded from under-frequency load shed plans. If unable to be excluded,
DCEI facilities should be assigned the lowest priority for load shed.

unit(s) to be started (typically on the low side of the Generator Step-up Transformer
(GSU). Recognizing that the technical aspects of system restoration (e.g., Resource
startups, load pickups, switching surges, voltages, frequency, synchronization of islands,
etc.) are crucial, the Plan has been developed in a coordinated fashion with the LCCs and
neighboring RCs.

In accordance with NERC Reliability Standards, ISO requires that LCC system restoration
strategies and associated actions, as described in the Plan, are coordinated and
consistent with the ISO high-level strategy for restoring the New England BES. ISO
incorporates into the Plan any modification developed or recommended by an LCC to any
Plan document, subject to the provisions in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1 - Central Dispatch Operating
Responsibilities and Authority, Appendix A - Assignment of Responsibilities (OP-1A) also
includes responsibilities of ISO, the LCCs, other TOs and Market Participants (MPs),
including GOPs, during system restoration.

**3.2 Components of the Plan**

The Plan is comprised of general restoration strategies as per Attachment A, as well as a
collection of specifically defined interconnected contiguous system restoration paths (Primary
and Alternate Paths to nuclear power stations) from the generation substations associated with
the first Generators to be cranked by the DBRs and on to other substations along the Paths,
ultimately connecting to New England nuclear power stations, inter-LCC ties or
interconnections/synchronizations with neighboring RCAs, including, but not limited to, M/LCC
18, Attachment M – Paths to Alternative Cranked Generators (M/LCC 18M) (Confidential)

**1. Basic Minimum Power System and Key Facilities**

As part of the development of the Plan, ISO has classified certain facilities within the
Plan in accordance with categories of system restoration plan facilities established
in NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory #8, System Restoration (NPCC
Directory #8). The Plan includes facilities that form electrical islands that are part of
the core of the Plan. Each of these islands constitutes a basic minimum power
system (BMPS), as defined in NPCC Directory #8. Each of these BMPS islands
consists of a DBR and may also include other facilities such as a generation
substation associated with the first Generator to be cranked by the DBR, as well as
transmission lines and associated other transmission substations connected to load
that are necessary to stabilize the system and establish a stable island for the
purpose of initiating the Plan. Establishment of these BMPS islands facilitates the
capability to synchronize electrical islands and implement the Plan to meet Plan
objectives. ISO considered the configuration of the New England BES and the
design of the Plan in its identification of BMPS island facilities. In the event of a
system blackout, the initial goal of the Plan is to establish each BMPS island. From
these BMPS islands, station service power to nuclear power stations can be reestablished and interconnections/synchronizations between LCCs and between ISO

and neighboring RCAs can be restored, while also allowing for the continued
recovery of the New England RCA. These BMPS islands include certain facilities
(e.g., DBRs and generation/transmission substations) designated as key facilities
(KFs), as defined by NPCC Glossary of Terms.

KFs include BMPS island facilities that ISO considers essential to the initiation of
the Plan and necessary to the establishment of a BMPS island following a system
blackout. BMPS island KFs include generating stations containing DBRs and may
also include other facilities determined to be essential to the establishment of a
BMPS stable island, such as substations required to provide those DBRs with
stabilizing load, or generation substations associated with the first Generators to be
cranked along the paths of the Plan. KFs may also include additional facilities that
are not part of a BMPS island, but that are considered essential to the
establishment of a BMPS island. These additional non-BMPS KFs include:

     - Control centers and telecommunication facilities which are necessary to

support protection and control facilities

     - Voice and data circuits between and within control centers

     - Voice and data circuits between control centers and BMPS island KF

generating / transmission substations

**2. Facilities Connecting the BMPS Island to Facilities Considered Plan Objectives**

A facility in the Plan that is part of a path from a BMPS island facility to a facility that is
a Plan objective (either an interconnection/synchronization point or a nuclear power
station) is referred to as an RFIN (restoration facility to interconnection/synchronization
point or a nuclear power station). An RFIN includes all other non-BMPS facilities in
the Plan that are not KFs. An RFIN includes:

    - Primary Path facilities that connect BMPS island KFs along contiguous paths to

nuclear power stations in New England or to interconnection/synchronization
points with LCCs and/or neighboring RCAs, as well as other selected facilities
interconnected to a BMPS island.

    - Alternate Path facilities and other Plan facilities used as part of the system

restoration strategies of the Plan to restore the transmission system that can
support the achievement of Plan objectives if one or more BMPS island KFs are
unavailable

    - Voice and data circuits between RFIN generating / transmission substations

**3. List of Plan Facilities**

ISO maintains a list of Plan facilities, M/LCC 11, Attachment D – New England System
Restoration Plan Resources List (NESRPR List) (M/LCC 11D). The NESRPR List
includes and specifically designates facilities that are DBRs as well as facilities that are
part of a BMPS island and those that are KFs and RFINs. The NESRPR List also

identifies each Initial Cranking Path Facility (ICPF), which is a facility in the Plan along
the transmission path from a DBR up to and including the initial cranked Generator to
be started. The NESRPR List, which identifies the facilities along the paths to the Plan
objectives, is updated by ISO once a year (or more often as necessary). ISO informs
entities about how their facilities have been designated in the Plan in accordance with
Section 4.6.4.

**3.3 Maintenance, Testing and Reporting Requirements for Plan Facilities**

**1. Maintenance, Testing and Reporting Requirements for Critical Components of**

**Key Facilities**

Any entity that owns a KF is responsible for identifying each KF critical component
(KFCC) within that KF, in accordance with NPCC Directory #8. KFCCs may include
but are not limited to equipment such as a blackstart generating unit or substation
backup power supply (battery, backup generator, etc.) that is required for continued
and proper operation of a KF in the event of a total loss of grid supply. Owners of
KFCCs are required to maintain a current list of KFCCs, perform required maintenance
and testing of KFCCs and report failures of KFCCs or test failures of KFCCs to ISO in
accordance with NPCC Directory #8 and ISO OP-1A. For a newly identified or
proposed KF, ISO allows the initial test(s) of the KFCC(s) of that KF that are required
by NPCC Directory #8 to be completed within one year of the implementation date that
the facility becomes a KF in the Plan. NPCC Directory #8 also requires KF owners to
provide a summary of the maintenance and testing records for KFCC equipment to
ISO, upon request.

Unplanned outages of KFCC facilities are communicated between the ISO and LCCs
in accordance with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 13 - ISO and LCC
Communication Practices (M/LCC 13) and ISO CROP.50001 Reporting Procedure.
Records of these equipment outages are maintained in the ISO Outage Scheduling
Software. The SRWG reviews such KFCC failures or test failures (in accordance with
Section 4.1), evaluates the implications of such failures on the Plan (in accordance
with Section 4.2) and takes whatever action is necessary and appropriate to modify the
Plan or the implementation of the Plan (in accordance with Section 4.3).

      - The event, system disturbance or facility outage is expected to reduce the

availability of one or more Plan facilities

      - A Plan facility is not available due to an event, system disturbance or facility

outage that has not been addressed in an Alternate Path document

ii. If the SRWG determines that a Temporary Restoration Path needs to be

developed, they shall develop one in accordance with Section 4.3.9.

3. Each year, preferably during the second (2[nd]) quarter of the year, the SRWG shall review

and evaluate the Plan, addressing the following:

A. Evaluate the DBRs in the Plan, including the following:

i. The SRWG will use the methods found in M/LCC 11 Attachment G - Designated

Blackstart Resource Evaluation Method (M/LCC 11G) to assist in evaluating
whether the number, size, location and diversity of DBRs are sufficient to meet
the needs of the Plan. The SRWG will also use those methods to assist in
determining whether a prospective DBR would be advantageous to the existing
Plan

ii. Review the results of DBR testing and verify that the DBRs in the Plan can

perform their intended function including an evaluation of whether the reported
minimum amount of on-site fuel allows for appropriate run time to energize the
cranking path

iii. Provide recommendations to the SRWG Chair regarding the removal or

withdrawal of DBRs from ISO OATT Schedule 16 Blackstart Service and/or the
addition of DBRs to ISO OATT Schedule 16 Blackstart Service.

iv. As needed, the SRWG Chair (or designee), with input from the SRWG, shall

seek additional DBRs to replace or augment the existing DBRs in the Plan.

B. Verify that the cranking path between each system restoration path (Primary and

Alternate Paths to nuclear power stations) DBR and the Generator to be cranked is
documented, including initial switching requirements.

C. Verify that minimum load requirements for stability and station service are

documented for each DBR and for each Generator to be cranked by a DBR.
Specifically, verify that the following information has been documented for each DBR
and each generation substation associated with the first Generator(s) to be cranked
by that DBR:

i. Minimum Manual Load Point (MW) at which the Generator can operate, as

defined in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical
Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related
Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14)

ii. Station service load of the Generator (MW)

D. Evaluate the Plan to identify areas where inter-LCC assistance and interaction is

appropriate during system restoration.

E. Verify that one or more objectives of the Plan can be achieved through annual

simulation exercises conducted as part of Plan Training using the M/LCC Training
Simulator Model and during any other Plan Training exercise. During any simulation
or exercise involving the Plan, the following shall be performed:

i. Each year, the SRWG Chair (or designee) and an SRWG member (or designee)

from each LCC shall complete the M/LCC 11C for Plan Training exercises
conducted in that year and provide a copy to the SRWG Chair (or designee)
within one month of when the simulation exercise is conducted (or no later than
within one month of the last exercise conducted as part of Plan Training).

ii. The SRWG shall review each completed and compiled M/LCC 11C from the

Plan Training simulation exercises conducted in that year and consider its
content in the evaluation of the Plan and document the results of such
evaluation in SRWG minutes.

4. At least once every five years, ISO, with assistance of each LCC SRWG member (or

designee) as applicable to the study being conducted, shall verify through some
combination of analysis of actual events or technical study simulations that the Plan
(including each DBR in the Plan) accomplishes its intended function.

A. Such analysis shall verify:

i. The capability of each DBR to meet the real and reactive power requirements of

its associated cranking paths and the dynamic capability to supply initial loads

ii. The location and magnitude of loads required to control voltages and frequency

within acceptable operating limits

### NOTE

 The Reactive Control System (RCS) status for each Generator listed below is represented by an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) ON/OFF flag in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS). All components of the RCS must be functional for the AVR flag to indicate “ON”; conversely, failure of or limited operation of any RCS component should result in the AVR flag indicating “OFF”.

 The ISO Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs) refer to each Generator RCS as an AVR.

  Generators listed in the Table 1 below have an RCS, and the components that comprise
 their RCS are indicated by “X” in Table 1

  Assuming correct functioning of the Generator’s AVR flag in the ISO EMS, outage of any
 RCS equipment will cause the AVR flag to toggle to “OFF”, and ISO operators will be notified via EMS alarm. Generator operators shall also notify ISO control room of an RCS component that is compromised.

  In the event that an RCS is not fully functional, any identified impact of the AVR OFF flag
 will be indicated in applicable TOGs, and may be reflected in any limits in ILC. The real time on-call engineer may be contacted if there are any questions.

# 3. Introduction

ISO New England (ISO) Operating Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control
(OP-12) and ISO Operating Procedure No. 14 Technical Requirements for Generators,
Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology
Regulation Resources (OP-14) establish the guidelines to ensure that reliable and
desirable voltage levels are maintained on the New England Transmission System. The
reliability of the system is dependent upon the automatic operation of Generator, as
defined in OP-14, reactive controls. If these devices are removed from service, the ability
of the power system to respond dynamically to normal power changes, unplanned events
and abnormal conditions will be impacted. The ISO Control Room Staff must be notified
immediately of any reduction in capability regarding automatic voltage control in order to
conduct studies and formulate contingency actions.

# 4. Responsibilities

The following steps outline the task performance responsibilities of the Market Participant
generating station operator (or designee), the LCC System Operator, and the ISO Control
Room staff:

A. Each Market Participant generating station operator (or designee) is responsible for:

1. Monitoring the status of each AVR, PSS or RCS that is required to be in-service. If

such equipment becomes inoperative unexpectedly, the generating station operator
(or designee) is responsible for immediately notifying the ISO Control Room and
creating an outage application in the ISO outage scheduling software, including an
expected return-to-service time based upon initiated repairs.

2. Requesting ISO Operations Support Services (OSS) Outage Coordination and LCC

System Operator approval if a planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS is required.

3. Notifying the ISO Control Room prior to the start or completion of an approved

planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS for final review and approval.

4. Reporting any AVR, PSS or RCS related Generator Real-Time operating

constraints, such as restricted availability, restricted response rates, or MW or
MVAR output limitations, to the ISO Control Room and LCC System Operator.

5. Projecting the expected return-to-service time/date and reporting this information to

the ISO Control Room.

6. Providing updates when the expected return-to-service time/date changes.

7. Controlling the Generator AVR to maintain the appropriate voltage schedule.

B. Each LCC System Operator is responsible for:

1. Coordinating, with ISO OSS Outage Coordination, each planned outage for a

Generator AVR, PSS or RCS as required by Section 8, below.

2. Receiving notification from the ISO Control Room of each AVR, PSS and RCS

outage covered by this procedure.

3. Reviewing each AVR, PSS or RCS related operating restriction and limitation

imposed on the Generator and its impact on voltage and reactive control in the
applicable LCC area of jurisdiction.

4. Instructing the Generator with the AVR outage to maintain or change either its

voltage schedule or its reactive power schedule

5. Recording the outage and instruction in the appropriate LCC log.

# 5. Definitions

**Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR):**

A voltage-regulating device designed to hold a set voltage by comparing the Reactive
Resource terminal voltage to the reference voltage. AVR equipment may include, but is
**not limited to any of the following: synchronous generator AVR, centralized voltage**
controller typically implemented in renewable power plants, and Distributed Control
System (DCS).

**Power System Stabilizer (PSS):**

An electronic control system applied at a generator that helps to dampen out dynamic
oscillations. Such devices, when installed at a generator, can be an integral component
of the generator’s ability to respond to dynamic disturbances of the power system.

**Reactive Control System (RCS):**

A comprehensive voltage regulation scheme or system at a generating station that
maintains steady-state and/or transient voltage stability by deploying multiple reactive
control devices including, but not limited to any of the following: capacitor/reactor bank,
Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS), Static Var Compensator (SVC),
synchronous condenser, and load tap changing (LTC) transformer, etc. For example, the
typical RCS in a renewable energy wind facility consisting of a STATCOM, a LTC
transformer, shunt capacitors and online turbines which function simultaneously, in a
specific coordinated fashion, to maintain the POI and collector system voltages within a
predefined band. An RCS is typically required to be in-service for normal generator
operation.

# 6. Applicability

This procedure applies to:

     - All Market Participant Generators, which are required to have an AVR and operate

it in the automatic voltage regulation mode. Generators exempted from the
requirement to have an AVR in automatic are listed in Attachment A - Generators
Exempted from AVR Requirements (M/LCC 8A).

     - All Market Participant Generators required to have a PSS, as determined by and

documented in their System Impact Study (SIS). Generators equipped with a PSS
are required to maintain the state of that PSS as described in Attachment B Generators Requiring PSS Devices In/Out of Service (M/LCC 8B).

     - All Market Participant Generators required to have an RCS in service are listed in

Attachment C - Generators Requiring a Reactive Control System (M/LCC 8C)

# 7. Exempting Generators from Automatic Voltage Control Requirements

Certain Generators, described in M/LCC 8A, within the New England RCA are exempted
from the requirement to operate with an AVR in-service and controlling voltage because
they either (1) do not have an AVR or (2) operation with the AVR in the automatic voltage
control mode and controlling voltage may adversely impact reliability. For all such
Generators, ISO and the LCC have reviewed the impact and have determined that the
lack of automatic voltage control is acceptable or required.

A Generator is listed in M/LCC 8A, when the Market Participant submits an exemption
request to ISO and if that Generator is: (1) not required to have an AVR by Schedule 22
Large Generator Interconnection Procedure (LGIP) / Schedule 23 Small Generator
Interconnection Procedure (SGIP) processes or their predecessor or successor
provisions, and (2) that request is evaluated by both the LCC and ISO in order to
determine what type of exemption study is required. An exemption request determination
by the LCC and ISO may require that the exemption request and study be performed and
approved under Section I.3.9 Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans of the ISO
Tariff (PPA Process) and supported by reliability studies performed by ISO System
Planning. Initial screening criteria for a Generator exemption request to determine if a full
PPA Process is required are contained in Section 7.A of this M/LCC procedure.
Regardless of whether or not a Generator AVR exemption request meets the initial
screening exemption criteria, ISO reserves the right to determine if that request requires a
full PPA Process application.

Inclusion of a Generator in the M/LCC 8A exemption list does not preclude re-evaluation
required with changes processed through the LGIP or SGIP processes, or their
predecessor or successor provisions, respectively, and an exemption may be precluded
by Schedules 22 or 23 for Interconnection Requests under those processes. Inclusion in

||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|


the M/LCC 8A exemption list does not relieve a Generator from adhering to any other ISO
New England Operating Document or program requirements.

A. Proposed Plan Application Process Exemption Criteria

Typically, an AVR exemption request for a Generator Reactive Resource that is not
precluded for Interconnection Requests under Schedules 22 or 23 and that meets any
one of the criteria contained in Section 7.A.1 of this M/LCC, does not require a full PPA
Process in order to approve or deny the AVR exemption request.

1. The Generator shall:

    - Be connected to the transmission or distribution system at a voltage level less

than 69 kV

    - Have a total plant gross output at a common point of connection, as described in

OP-14, of less than 20 MW Summer or Winter Network Resource Capability
(NRC), whichever is greater

   - Have never been equipped with an AVR

Any Generator seeking an exemption shall provide to ISO a detailed description of how
the plant will be operated in lieu of active AVR control (i.e., in manual control or constant
power factor control mode), including the expected reactive capability (lagging and
leading) the plant may utilize over the course of daily operation.

If the Generator for which the AVR exemption is sought has no prior PPA application with
ISO and the AVR exemption request is submitted prior to being determined ready to
respond to dispatch by ISO, the Lead MP shall:

1. Submit an AVR exemption request via the ISO Participant Support Ask ISO

application. Such application shall include at a minimum the following
documentation:

a. A technical analysis supporting acceptable operation without the AVR

operating in voltage control mode

b. A valid technical reason, normally provided by the interconnecting

transmission or distribution utility, stating the reason that the Generator
cannot operate with its AVR in voltage control mode

ISO and the LCCs shall use this information in their review of the exemption request.

# 8. Request and Approve an AVR, PSS or RCS Outage

**NOTE**

AVR mode changes during normal start-up and shutdown of units are expected and
need not be reported to ISO.

**Planned Outages:**

The Market Participant Generator Operator (GOP) shall notify the LCC of any planned
maintenance of the AVR, PSS or RCS that reduces the capacity of the equipment or
renders the equipment inoperable. The GOP shall submit an outage request for the AVR,
PSS or RCS via the ISO outage scheduling software. The ISO OSS Outage Coordination
group and the OSS Real-Time Studies group shall perform appropriate analysis and
approve or disapprove the outage request with the concurrence of the LCC. Approved
outage requests for AVR, PSS, or RCS equipment that limits generation in accordance
with a Transmission Operating Guide (TOG), or other guidance from OSS, will be entered
in the ISO outage scheduling software as a transmission outage application, in addition to
the corresponding generation application. Prior to the start or completion of an approved
planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS, the Market Participant GOP shall also contact
both the ISO Control Room and the LCC for final review and approval.

**Emergency or Forced Outages:**

The Market Participant GOP shall notify the ISO Control Room staff of an emergency or
forced outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS that reduces the capacity of the equipment or
renders the equipment inoperable. The ISO shall notify the appropriate LCC of the AVR
emergency or forced outage. The LCC shall instruct the Generator with the AVR outage
to maintain or change either its voltage schedule or its reactive power. Any outage of an
AVR, PSS or RCS shall be logged by the LCC and ISO Control Room staff. If an AVR,
PSS is out-of-service or there is any reduction in RCS capability for more than 30
minutes, the ISO Control Room staff shall create an outage in the ISO outage scheduling
software. ISO Control Room staff and the OSS Real-Time Studies group (on-call
engineer) shall perform the necessary analysis to determine what, if any, corrective
actions are required. Applications for AVR, PSS, or RCS equipment that limits generation
in accordance with a TOG, or other guidance from OSS, will be entered in the ISO outage
scheduling software as a transmission outage application in addition to the corresponding
generation application. The ISO Control Room staff shall obtain concurrence from the
LCC if any corrective actions are required.

**Criteria for Evaluating the Impact of an AVR, PSS or RCS Outage:**

The ISO OSS Real-Time Studies group shall perform the appropriate analysis or studies
necessary to:

     - Evaluate planned maintenance of any AVR, PSS or RCS that may result in the

equipment capacity being reduced or being removed from service, determine if the


-----

|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|
|---|---|

||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|


request for the planned outage shall be approved or disapproved, and obtain the
concurrence of the LCC System Operator.

  - Evaluate planned maintenance of any AVR, PSS or RCS that may result in the

equipment capacity being reduced or being removed from service and determine
the plant or system restrictions that exist for the planned maintenance condition(s).

  - Re-evaluate a previously approved planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS at the

time that the equipment is actually to be taken out-of-service, taking into account
any changes to system conditions since the original evaluation and approval, and
determine if the request for the equipment to be taken out-of-service shall be
approved or disapproved.

In performing the appropriate analysis or studies in order to determine whether to approve
or disapprove the planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS or to determine what, if any,
corrective actions are required in the event of an emergency or forced outage of an AVR,
PSS or RCS, the criteria considered by the ISO OSS Real-Time Studies group includes,
but would not necessarily be limited to the following:

  - Industry standards and guidelines for reliable system operation provided by NERC

(notably, in NERC Reliability Standards TOP-001, TOP-002, and VAR-001) and
NPCC.

  - ISO requirements for reliable system operations as documented in ISO New

England Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19).

  - Impact of the change on the system’s voltage performance, reactive reserves

and/or stability behavior which may in turn impact system operability and reliability,
reduce system transfer limits and degrade network stability performance.

In addition, there are certain situations where the removal from service of an AVR, PSS,
or RCS should be avoided, including the following:

  - An AVR, PSS, or RCS that is required to be in-service should not be removed from

service when Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions
Alert (M/LCC 2) is implemented, unless the outage is unavoidable.

  - The simultaneous removal from service of several AVRs, PSSs or RCSs in any one

area should be avoided.

### Background

#### Certain Resources, described in M/LCC 8A, within the New England RCA are exempted from the requirement to operate with an AVR in-service and controlling voltage because they either (1) do not have an AVR or (2) operation with the AVR in the automatic voltage control mode and controlling voltage may adversely impact reliability. For all such Resources, ISO and the LCC have reviewed the impact and have determined that the lack of automatic voltage control is acceptable or required. 

 The Resources listed in this document are exempted from the requirement to operate with an AVR in-service and controlling voltage. A System Impact Study may be required before a Resource is removed from or added to any of the following LCC Tables. The data in each LCC’s Table is ordered by Asset ID number.

 The Resources listed in each of Tables 1 through 6 are expected to follow either a reactive power schedule or a power factor schedule as described in their NX-12D forms. The Resources listed in each of Tables 1 through 6 are documented as “Option C” for Voltage Control Option in their NX12D forms.

# 2. Purpose

This procedure is applicable to both the Long Term and Short Term Outage Scheduling
processes as defined within ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3). Outage requests containing Major
Transmission Elements (MTE) or critical 345kV line paths require greater coordination
as they may have a significant impact on the reliable and/or economic operation of the
New England Transmission System and as a result, may have greater potential to being
cancelled or denied due to economic impacts, than other transmission facilities. A list of
MTE equipment can be found in Attachment E - Major Transmission Element Listing
and critical 345kV line paths can be found in Attachment F - Critical 345 kV Power
Transfer Paths. The outage coordination process is driven by the categorization of Bulk
Electric System (BES) facilities. The process for verifying and updating of these
transmission facilities can be found in Attachment C - Outage Coordination Verification
and Revision Process for BES Category A and Category B Facilities. A complete list of
BES Category A and B Facilities can be found on the ISO New England (ISO) OASIS
website using the following link.

This procedure describes the process of submitting transmission outage applications
internally within the New England Reliability Control Area/Balancing Authority Area
(RCA/BAA) between the Local Control Centers (LCCs) and ISO. The ISO Outage
Scheduling software is the primary tool used to process all basic information required for
each transmission outage application. The use of the ISO Outage Scheduling software
also allows ISO to efficiently communicate its study results to an LCC.

This procedure is not intended to replace the telephone conversations held between
ISO and any LCC concerning the impact of any transmission outage application on the
operation of the New England Transmission System. It is merely intended to streamline
the process of submitting transmission outage applications from the LCCs to ISO.
When the ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, email is used to
communicate transmission outage applications.

# 3. Procedure

**NOTE**

The ISO Outage Scheduling software is used to communicate transmission outage
applications.

     - The intent of this software is to allow each LCC to submit all pertinent information

regarding each transmission facility outage.

     - The ISO Outage Coordination group and the ISO Security Operator evaluate

transmission outage applications submitted using the ISO Outage Scheduling
software.

     - The ISO Outage Scheduling software will automatically log transmission outage

applications as they are submitted to ISO.

ISO and each LCC responsibilities associated with processing transmission outage
applications are clearly defined in OP-3 and ISO New England System Operating
Procedure SOP-RTMKTS.0180.0055 - Process and Perform Reactive Capability Tests.
Planned transmission outages must be submitted within the prescribed timelines
provided in this Procedure - Attachment D - Minimum Advance Notice Times - Outage
Requests for Specific Equipment.

ISO and each LCC are responsible for the communication and coordination of
transmission outage applications that directly affect any element that is defined in
Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations
(M/LCC 1) as specified in the following Attachments:

     - M/LCC 1 Attachment C - Millstone Nuclear Power Station

     - M/LCC 1 Attachment D - Seabrook Nuclear Power Station

Outside of normal working hours or in the absence of personnel from the ISO Outage
Coordination group, the ISO Security Operator and each applicable LCC Operator is
responsible for processing transmission outage applications.

ISO does not perform voltage reliability studies prior to Real-Time for reactive tests on
Resources with reactive capability less than ten (10) MVAr.

1. The transmission outage application process for ISO and each LCC shall be performed

as follows:

**NOTE**

The transmission outage application transmittal is available to ISO in the ISO Outage
Scheduling software as a Submitted Application.

A. The LCC shall prepare all necessary LCC informational items using the ISO Outage

Scheduling software. Transmission outage applications identified as NRA or relay
work shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with M/LCC7 Attachment D,

|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|
||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|


and OP24 Appendix C, respectively.

1) When the LCC has completed the informational items, the transmission outage

application shall be transmitted (Submitted) to ISO.

a. To promote efficient coordination, if the transmitted transmission outage

application has associated or supporting outages (e.g., transmission
switching, creating air gap, etc.) ISO shall request the LCC to link these
outages.

B. If ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, the LCC shall:

1) On M/LCC 7 Attachment A - ISO Transmission Facility Outage Request Form

enter all necessary items listed in the “To Be Completed by Local Control
Center” section.

2) Email the completed Attachment A to ISO.

C. If a transmission outage application is transmitted by an email outside of normal

working hours, the LCC shall make a telephone call to notify the ISO Security
Operator of the email.

**NOTE**

The ISO Outage Scheduling software automatically assigns application numbers when
the transmission outage application is submitted to ISO. Receipt by ISO is understood
to have occurred when an application number is assigned.

D. When a transmission outage application is being studied, the ISO Outage

Coordination group/ISO Security Operator shall place the transmission outage
application in the Study mode in the ISO Outage Scheduling software.

**NOTE**

Until a transmission outage application is placed in the Study mode by ISO, that
application can be altered by the LCC.

1) ISO shall update the ISO Outage Scheduling software with the necessary

changes to the transmission outage application.

E. If an email is used, upon receipt of the transmission outage application form by

email, the ISO Outage Coordination group / Security Operator shall:

1) Call the LCC to acknowledge receipt of the transmission outage application form

by email.

a. Note 1C above.

2) Assign the transmission outage application received by email, an ISO application

number by entering the transmission outage application into the ISO Outage

Scheduling software.

F. If the ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, by 1600 hours each day, the

LCC shall verify that an application number has been received for each application
transmitted by email to ISO that day.

1) Any discrepancies shall be reported to ISO to verify that an application has not

been inadvertently overlooked or lost in the email process.

2) Once the ISO Outage Scheduling software is returned to service, the ISO

Outage Coordination group shall enter the outage information received by email.

G. The ISO Outage Coordination group/ISO Security Operator shall discuss the

detailed transmission outage application with the LCC, when additional analysis is
required to provide complete understanding of the transmission outage application
and to obtain all necessary inputs to the ISO study and decision-making process.

1) Items to be discussed may include, but are not limited to:

    - Facility (name and nomenclature)

   - Outage Cause Code and Sub-Cause Code

    - Reason for application (description of work to be performed)

    - Emergency restoration time

    - Time and date switching is to begin

    - Time and date the facility is to be restored to normal operation

    - Any LCC and /or system outside of the New England RCA/BAA to whom

notifications have been given

    - Other information pertinent to the application that may affect an ISO decision,

such as a request to revise a Resource outage schedule to address
congestion issues with the transmission outage

    - LCC analysis results and approval including contingencies and limiting

elements, local voltage constraints, must-run Resource and restricted
Resources.

    - Relevant ISO/LCC communication and coordination efforts that have been

performed with nuclear power stations for those elements identified in
M/LCC 1 and Attachments C or D that affect one or more Nuclear Plant
Interface Requirements (NPIRs).

||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|


**NOTE**

The coordination and communication of planned transmission outages must be
conducted in a manner that respects the potential need to perform system restoration
when planned or unplanned outages occur. The concurrent scheduling of planned
transmission outages that impact the Primary and Alternate Paths of a restoration plan
should be avoided.

   - Requests that identify a Primary or Alternate Restoration Path which may be

interrupted. Overlaps of Primary and Alternate Paths should be avoided. If an
overlap is unavoidable, the System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) and
LCC outage coordination staff will need to supply the following, prior to the
planned outage submittal:

     - Provide a studied Temporary Restoration Path on M/LCC 7 - Attachment

H - Temporary Restoration Path; Or

     - Evaluate the outage Recall Time of the outages and determine which can

be modified to less than or equal to (≤) 24 hours.

     - If one of these cannot be provided upon Submittal, the outage request will

be Denied.

internal and external to ISO New England or have a recall time greater than 24 hours are
more at risk of potential recall, denial or repositioning based on system conditions.

   - Must-run generation identified (if required) and the conditions that require the

must-run generation to operate.

   - Low load, high voltage studies shall be conducted when devices that significantly

affect the reactive capability of the BES are removed from service.

   - Applicable Transmission Operating Guides identified.

   - Submit switching applications when:
```
     o Generation is further restricted during switching
     o An interface is further restricted during switching
     o An identified NPIR requirement is operated during switching
     o Directed by the ISO

```
   - Ensure relay/Non-Reclosing Assurance (NRA) applications contain relevant

information.

   - If required, complex studies are completed.

   - ISO engineering review is conducted when an “abnormal” system topology is

expected. This would include but is not limited to:
```
        o Closing normally open devices
        o Energization of new facilities
        o Retirement of facilities
        o Utilization of temporary bypass configurations

```
   - If required, temporary guides are issued.

  - All documentation is complete, accurate and references the correct outage and

time frame.

  - Confirm LCC/ISO communication and coordination efforts that have been

performed with nuclear power stations for those elements identified in M/LCC 1
and Attachments C or D that affect one or more NPIR(s).

K. If it is determined that a Planned Outage for the upcoming Operating Day has not

been studied as required, and if time permits, further studies to correct the
transmission outage application will be referred to the affected LCC(s) and either the
ISO Outage Coordination group or the ISO OSS Real-Time Study group on-call
engineer.

  - If time does not permit further study by these groups, the ISO Control Room will

**not allow the Planned Outage to start and will delay or cancel the outage if**
required.

L. Within 60 minutes prior to the scheduled switching time, each LCC shall perform the

following, prior to requesting permission from ISO to remove equipment from
service:

  - Review the applicable application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software for

generation must-run requirements and/or generation restrictions.

  - Review the applicable application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software for

interface limits in accordance with permanent or temporary transmission guides
or detailed information in the transmission application.

  - Perform a Real-Time power flow security analysis with the requested element

removed from service.

M. In cases where reconfiguration of the transmission system is required, each LCC

shall perform a Real-Time power flow security analysis prior to requesting
permission from ISO to restore equipment to service.

N. Transmission outage start and completion times shall be entered into the ISO

Outage Scheduling software by the ISO Control Room Operator.

O. In the event of an Unplanned Outage, the LCC shall notify the ISO Outage

Coordination group or ISO Security Operator of the outage and submit an Outage
Request into the ISO Outage Scheduling software as soon as possible.

1) ISO/LCC shall conduct communication and coordination efforts with the affected

nuclear power station or Reliability Coordinator as soon as possible for those
Unplanned Outage Requests that include elements identified in:

**NOTE**

A Planned Outage may be started early when that outage has been approved by the
Outage Coordination group and is not expected to cause congestion.

P. When system conditions are favorable, the LCC may request to start an approved

outage early to enhance reliability or outage coordination efficiency.

1) If an Approved Planned Outage is to be started early, the LCC shall notify the

ISO Security Operator of the future Planned Outage application and make a
request to start the outage.

2) The ISO Security Operator shall discuss the detailed transmission outage

application with the LCC to ensure complete understanding of the transmission
outage application and to obtain all necessary input to the ISO decision-making
process. The ISO Security Operator may grant a request to start an approved
outage early if it is determined that the outage will not adversely impact reliability
or market efficiency. It is the sole discretion of the ISO Control Room System
Operators to grant such a request.

**NOTE**

ISO will accept relay protection outages on a temporary basis under acceptable
conditions for maintenance of single protection groups for an element with redundant
local protective relay groups.

Extended outages for long periods affecting one protection group for a transmission
element with redundant local protection are generally unacceptable.

Q. Transmission Owners (TOs) and Lead Market Participants (Lead MPs) for

Generator Owners (GOs) shall avoid Protection System Component outages that
last longer than thirty (30) calendar days. If a Protection System Component that is
involved in the protection of equipment listed in OP-24C is out-of-service for longer
than thirty (30) calendar days, then the Transmission Operator (TOP) with
information from the TO or Lead MP for the GO shall provide:

1) An attachment to the outage request showing progress in restoring the

Protection System Component to service; And

2) A corrective action plan describing the steps that will be undertaken to restore

the Protection System Component to service.

# I. Instructions:

When requested by an ISO New England (ISO) Control Room Operator, the CONVEX
System Operations Supervisor (SOS) shall follow the steps below to develop a New
England Area Control Error (ACE) using the ISO Pool Control Error Calculator (PCEC)
display in the CONVEX Energy Management System (EMS).

**A. NORMAL PCEC OPERATION**

1. The ISO Control Room Operator shall contact the CONVEX SOS, provide the desired

New England Automatic Generation Control (AGC) Interchange Schedule and request
that CONVEX begin developing an ACE using the PCEC as follows:

a. Provide the AGC Interchange Schedule as the algebraic sum of the NB ties, NY

Northern AC ties, NNC AC tie, and CSC DC tie schedule using the following
convention:

i. Tie schedule into NE is negative

ii. Tie schedule out of NE is positive

b. Provide the scheduled frequency of the Eastern Interconnection.

2. The CONVEX SOS shall enter the New England AGC Interchange Schedule in the “INT

AGC SCHEDULE” field of the PCEC display.

3. The CONVEX SOS shall enter the scheduled frequency in the “FREQUENCY

SCHEDULE” field of the PCEC display.

4. The CONVEX SOS shall verify the “POOL CONTROL ERROR"" displayed MW value

update is consistent with the Schedule entered.

5. When the ISO Control Room Operator instructs the CONVEX SOS to begin controlling

to the ACE, the CONVEX SOS shall keep the ISO Control Room Operator apprised of
significant changes to the ACE (i.e. sustained changes greater than 50 MW). When
directed by the ISO Control Room Operator, the CONVEX SOS will manually dispatch
Resources until the ISO Control Room Operators arrive at the BCC and resume direct
control.

**B. ABNORMAL PCEC OPERATION**

1. If any of the monitored tie-lines show erroneous SCADA values, the SCADA input can

be manually replaced (manrep).

2. When the SCADA input value is indicating good quality, remove the manrep value.

This procedure, Master Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 (M/LCC 2) - Abnormal
Conditions Alert, is used to alert applicable power system operations, maintenance,
construction and test personnel as well as each applicable Market Participant (MP)
when an abnormal condition affecting the reliability of the power system exists or is
anticipated. When notified of an M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert, these entities
are expected to take precautions so that routine maintenance, construction or test
activities associated with any generating station, Dispatchable Asset Related Demand
(DARD), Demand Response Resource (DRR), transmission line, substation, dispatch
computer, and communications equipment do not further jeopardize the reliability of
the power system. If a maintenance, construction or test activity could jeopardize the
reliability of the power system such activity shall be postponed or stopped during the
M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert.

||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|


# 3. Introduction

Established operating procedures provide an approval process for any outage of the
following:

  - Resources in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource

Maintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5)

  - Transmission maintenance in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 
Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3)

  - Maintenance of dispatch computer and communications equipment in ISO New

England Operating Procedure No. 2 - Maintenance of Communications,
Computers, Metering, and Computer Support Equipment (OP-2).

  - Protection system equipment in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 24 
Protection Outages, Settings and Coordination (OP-24).

Each application for work involving the above areas shall be approved before any
maintenance, construction or test activity is conducted which would take equipment
out-of-service or obviously impact the reliability of the power system. Some
maintenance, construction or test activities are routinely undertaken that do not
require approval, when in the judgment of operations, maintenance, construction and
test personnel, these activities have a negligible reliability impact. These activities
include preventive maintenance, construction, preparatory work for outages, routine
maintenance that can be accomplished with equipment on-line, equipment testing,
etc.

However, if an abnormal condition exists or is anticipated and a maintenance,
construction or test activity is planned, such as nuclear surveillance tests and/or
preparatory work for a future equipment outage, an evaluation should be performed to
determine if there is a reliability risk associated with the work to be performed. If an
activity cannot be stopped and/or postponed, operations, maintenance, construction
and test personnel shall take precautions to prevent the on-going work from posing
further risk to the reliability of the power system. This procedure provides guidelines
for M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert notification and for actions to be taken to limit
risk.

This procedure does not in any way affect the application of OP-2, OP-3, OP-5 or OP24. When an M/LCC 2 Alert notification occurs, the postponement, curtailment,
restoration (line), or resumption (Resource) of work approved under those procedures
is to be considered on an individual basis by the ISO and/or the LCC.

An abnormal condition may affect the reliability of the entire New England Reliability
Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) or just a local reliability area.
An abnormal condition may be limited to a single Local Control Center (LCC).
Accordingly, provision is made in this procedure for separate ISO M/LCC 2 Abnormal

Conditions Alert and LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert notifications.

# 4. Definition of an Abnormal Condition

The determination that an abnormal condition affecting the reliability of the power
system exists or is anticipated is a decision made by the ISO Operations Shift
Supervisor or the LCC System Operator. An abnormal condition exists when the
reliability of the New England RCA/BAA is degraded. Typical indicators of an
abnormal condition are:

  - Forecasted or actual deficiency of Operating Reserves requiring implementation of

OP-4 or OP-7

  - Low transmission voltages and/or low reactive reserves

  - Inability to provide first contingency protection when an undesirable post
contingency condition might result; e.g., Load Shedding

  - Geomagnetic Disturbance

  - A credible threat to power system reliability such as sabotage or an approaching

storm

  - Operational staffing shortage impacting normal power system operations within

New England

  - Cold Weather Event is declared

  - Any other condition that may occur as determined by the ISO Operations Shift

Supervisor or the LCC System Operator

# 5. Types of M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert Notifications

For the purposes of this procedure, two types of notifications shall be issued:

**ISO M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert - This notice is issued when:**
```
   o An abnormal condition exists or is anticipated which affects the reliability of the

```
New England RCA/BAA
```
   o An abnormal condition which affects the reliability of the power system exists or

```
is anticipated within one LCC and this condition could further degrade as a
result of a maintenance, construction or test activity and affect another LCC

**LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert - This notice is issued when:**

An LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert shall be issued when an abnormal
condition which affects the reliability of the power system exists or is anticipated
solely within one LCC local reliability area and this condition would not become
further degraded by the consequences of a maintenance, construction and/or test
activity in another LCC local reliability area

||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|


# 6. Criteria to Stop and/or Postpone Maintenance, Construction and
 Test Activity not covered by OP-2, OP-3, OP-5 and OP-24

When an M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert notification is issued, a maintenance,
construction or test activity shall be stopped and/or postponed, if the following could
occur:

  - Reduction in reliability or output of a Resource

  - Increased reliability exposure (decreased reliability) to the loss of a critical

transmission facility

  - Reduced staffing that restricts operability of a Resource or Transmission facility

  - Interruption of voice or data communications used for dispatching purposes

  - Operation of any ISO, LCC, or MP SCADA computer becomes degraded or fails

If a maintenance, construction or test activity cannot be stopped and/or postponed;
precautions shall be taken to prevent the activity from posing further risk to the power
system.

If an activity that causes a reduction in generation, or impacts one of the above areas,
is on-going or planned during a declaration of this procedure, the applicable entity
may request the ISO System Operators to allow continuation of these activities on a
case-by-case basis.

## 1. Objective

This procedure describes the various types of Nuclear Plant Interface Meetings (NPIMs).
NPIMs are conducted to discuss matters affecting New England nuclear power stations.
Participants in NPIMs include ISO New England (ISO), applicable Local Control Centers
(LCCs), Transmission Owners (TOs) and Nuclear Plant Generator Operators (NPGOPs) as
applicable. This procedure also documents the responsibilities of ISO, LCCs, TOs and
NPGOPs with regard to interacting with nuclear power stations. This procedure does not in
any way change the intent of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 - Transmission
Outage Scheduling (OP-3) or ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource
Maintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5) and other applicable ISO procedures pertaining
to relays but rather is intended to clarify responsibilities of ISO, LCCs, TOs and NPGOPs
pertaining to NPIMs.

## 2. Background

The types of NPIMs (which are described in more detail in Section 4) include:

   - Weekly NPIMs

   - Monthly NPIMs

    - Quarterly NPIMs

   - Executive NPIMs

   - Natural Phenomena NPIMs

The LCCs, along with neighboring Reliability Coordinators, coordinate with ISO and submit
proposed transmission outage requests, in accordance with OP-3, to ISO for logging and
evaluation. Market Participants, including NPGOPs, submit their Generator outage requests
to ISO for scheduling Maintenance Outages in accordance with OP-5. In addition to normal
communication associated with dispatch and outage coordination, ISO has developed regular
communication protocols with NPGOPs, LCCs and TOs to address potential concerns that
may affect the Bulk Electric System (BES) and the reliable operation and safe shutdown of
nuclear power stations. Concern examples include, but are not limited to, tasks such as
nuclear power station design changes, transmission system modifications or regulatory
requirement changes.

# 1. Objective

The objective of this procedure is to recognize the special needs of the two nuclear
power stations in New England and document the responsibilities of certain
Transmission Entities (TEs), [including ISO New England (ISO), certain Local
Control Centers (LCCs) and other entities] and each Nuclear Plant Generator
Operator (NPGOP) with respect to maintaining proper grid support for the stations
as well as documenting communication paths in the event of grid degradation. The
entities that have certain responsibilities with respect to M/LCC 1 documents
(“M/LCC 1 Parties”) are listed in Section 4, Table A of this document.

This procedure contains provisions pertaining to maintaining voltage requirements
following a plant trip or system disturbance. This procedure contains provisions for
the NPGOP to be informed during abnormal system conditions so it can transfer
station loads to its auxiliary power sources in a timely fashion to facilitate safe
shutdown of the nuclear plant.

# 2. Background

**NOTE**

Per the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Glossary of Terms
Used in NERC Reliability Standards, Nuclear Plant Interface Requirements (NPIRs)
are: “The requirements based on NPLRs (Nuclear Plant Licensing Requirements)
and Bulk Electric System (BES) requirements that have been mutually agreed to by
the Nuclear Plant Generator Operator (NPGOP) and the applicable Transmission
Entities (TEs).” The NPGOP and TEs identified in Master/Local Control Center
Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) Attachments C
and D (in Section 10, Table 1 of each of these documents), are certain M/LCC 1
Parties that are each responsible for meeting one or more of the agreed-upon
NPIRs. The NPIRs in these Tables apply to various functions performed by these
TEs and/or the NPGOP, including Transmission Operator (TOP), Transmission
Planner (TP), Generator Operator (GOP) and Transmission Owner (TO). An
“applicable LCC” or “applicable Other TE” referenced in this document is an LCC or
TE that has agreed to one or more NPIRs pertinent to one or more nuclear power
stations in New England.

NERC Reliability Standard NUC-001 requires coordination between NPGOPs and
TEs, for ensuring nuclear plant safe operation and shutdown. The TEs are each
responsible for providing services related to certain NPIRs. Each NPGOP is
required to meet applicable NPIRs and to comply with Federal Regulations enforced
by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regarding safe
operation of the nuclear power station. To comply, each nuclear power station
requires a reliable grid in which both nuclear plant access to designated sources of
off-site power and the minimum voltage levels needed to operate station equipment
are maintained, to allow safe shutdown of the plant.

Effective communication among applicable NPGOPs, applicable LCCs and ISO is
imperative to keep each nuclear power station operating within its design limits.

      - Ability to provide an off-site power source is jeopardized.

      - Both ISO and the applicable LCC have lost the ability to assess the

operation of the electric system affecting NPIRs, including the ability
to determine post-contingency voltages.

E. ISO, each applicable LCC, and each applicable Other TE are responsible

for coordinating the rescheduling of any activity considered to be a Trip
Risk Activity, if transmission system conditions warrant.

F. A Trip Risk Activity could directly result in a plant trip and therefore would

be stopped and/or postponed during an Abnormal Conditions Alert, in
accordance with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal
Conditions Alert (M/LCC 2).

G. Examples of some Trip Risk Activities would include the testing of: turbine

valves, governors or reactor protection systems.

H. A Trip Risk Activity may have to be rescheduled if two or more nuclear

power stations request to undertake a Trip Risk Activity at the same time.

I. ISO, each applicable LCC and each applicable Other TE are responsible

for coordinating with the NPGOPs with respect to outages and
maintenance activities which affect the NPIRs in accordance with ISO New
England Operating Procedure No. 3 - Transmission Outage Scheduling
(OP-3), ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource
Maintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5), all ISO procedures
applicable to relays, and all M/LCC 1 procedure Attachments (especially
M/LCC 1 Attachment E - Nuclear Plant Interface Meetings).

J. ISO, each applicable LCC, and each applicable Other TE are responsible

for reviewing transmission outage information and notifying the NPGOP of
study results that may impact the nuclear power station or its off-site power
sources.

K. ISO shall inform the applicable NPGOP of the lowest limit it could be

dispatched to for either stability or thermal constraints if there is a nuclear
power station limit for any transmission outage, or a post contingent
restriction due to a transmission outage.

**NOTE**

The planning analyses of the electric system referenced in NUC-001, Requirement
R3 are long-term system planning analyses (for which, in New England, ISO is
solely responsible for conducting). The operating analyses of the electric system
referenced in NUC-001, Requirement R4.1 are short-term operational analyses
(for which ISO and the LCCs are both responsible for conducting).

average reactor coolant temperature. Modes differ depending upon whether
the reactor is a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) or a Boiling Water Reactor
(BWR).

**Risk-Sensitive Maintenance: A nuclear plant maintenance activity on certain**

equipment (e.g., emergency diesels, emergency core cooling systems, startup
or shutdown transformers, etc.) which requires a heightened awareness of the
status and availability of off-site power sources and that could limit
transmission maintenance activities.

**Station Blackout (SBO): The loss of all off-site and on-site AC power at the**

nuclear plant.

**Station Blackout Coping Time: The minimum time the nuclear plant can maintain**

adequate core cooling with the loss of all off-site and on-site AC power
(Station Black Out).

**Transmission Entity (TE): An entity that is responsible for providing services**

related to Nuclear Plant Interface Requirements (NPIRs). For the purposes of
M/LCC 1, TEs include ISO, certain LCCs and certain TOs listed in Section 10,
Table 1 of Attachments C and D.

**Trip Risk Activity: Any activity that could directly result in a plant trip and would be**

stopped and/or postponed during an Abnormal Conditions Alert, in accordance
with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert
(M/LCC 2).

**RELIABILITY STANDARDS**

**FOR THE**

**NEW ENGLAND AREA POOL TRANSMISSION FACILITIES**

**1.** **INTRODUCTION**

The purpose of these New England reliability standards is to assure the reliability of the New England
Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF) through coordination of system planning, design and operation.
These standards apply to all entities comprising or using the New England PTF. The host Market
Participant or Transmission Owner (the Market Participant or Transmission Owner through which a
non-Market Participant and non-Transmission Owner connects to the PTF) shall use its best efforts to
assure that, whenever it enters into arrangements with non-Market Participants and non-Transmission
Owners, such arrangements are consistent with these standards.

These reliability standards establish minimum design criteria for the New England PTF. In addition to
these standards, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Northeast Power
Coordinating Council (NPCC) also have design criteria which may also apply to portions of the New
England PTF. NERC and NPCC design criteria may be more stringent than what is contained in these
standards. Therefore, meeting the requirements set forth in this document does not assure that NERC
and NPCC’s criteria have also been met. Similarly, there may be instances that these standards are
more stringent than the design criteria of NERC or NPCC and meeting the NERC or NPCC design
criteria does not meet these standards.

The New England PTF is required to be designed to meet the performance requirements for
representative contingencies as defined in these reliability standards. Analyses of these contingencies
may include assessment of the potential for the inability to meet the Nuclear Plant Interface
Requirements (NPIRs). The NPIRs for each nuclear plant generator subject to dispatch by ISO New
England Inc. (ISO) are documented in the Attachment to Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1

- Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) applicable to that nuclear plant generator.

The loss of minor portions of the transmission system may be tolerated provided the reliability of the
overall interconnected transmission system is not jeopardized and the NPIRs are met.

**3.** **PTF TRANSMISSION REQUIREMENTS**

The New England PTF shall be designed with sufficient transmission capacity to serve Area loads and
meet the applicable NPIRs for the contingency events noted below. The contingencies shall be applied
to transmission elements and generating resources in order to examine the potential for the inability to
meet the performance criteria as defined in this procedure on the New England PTF. Contingencies
listed in Table 1 and Table 2 below that are expected to produce more severe impacts on the PTF shall
be evaluated for system performance. The design shall assume power flow conditions with applicable
transfers, loads, and resource conditions that reasonably stress the system.

In applying these criteria, it is recognized that it may be necessary to restrict the output of resources
following the loss of a system element. This may be necessary to maintain system reliability in the
event of a subsequent outage.

Remedial Action Schemes/Automatic Control Schemes (RAS/ACS) may be employed in the design of
the interconnected power system. The addition, modification or retirement of a RAS/ACS on the New
England Transmission System must be reviewed by the Reliability Committee and approved by ISO
New England. For a RAS, such changes may also require review and approval by NPCC.

Conditions required for the design of the transmission system can be classified as:

N-0: All-facilities-in
N-1: All-facilities-in followed by a contingency
N-1-1: Scenarios that have contingency while a single element is out of service. After removal
of the single element from service, system adjustments are made in preparation for the next
contingency. These adjustments[1] can consist of any combination of the following:

a. Increasing resources available within ten minutes following notification
b. Adjustments that can be achieved in thirty minutes such as:

        - Generator runback and/or generator tripping

        - Reducing transfers on HVDC facilities

        - Adjusting phase angle regulators, transformer load tap changers, and variable
reactors

        - Switching series and shunt capacitors and reactors.

        - Reducing imports from external Areas.

The contingencies and the performance requirements for each condition are listed in Table 1 and Table
2 below.

1 Total increase in resource adjustment must not exceed 1,200 MW.

**APPENDIX ""C"" Damping Criterion**

The purpose of the damping criterion is to assure small signal stability of the New England PTF
system. System damping is characterized by the damping ratio, zeta (ζ). The damping ratio provides
an indication of the length of time an oscillation will take to dampen. The damping criterion specifies
a minimum damping ratio of 0.03, which corresponds to a 1% settling time of one minute or less for all
oscillations with a frequency of 0.4 Hz or higher. Conformance with the criterion may be
demonstrated with the use of small signal eigenvalue analysis to explicitly identify the damping ratio
of all questionable oscillations.

Time domain analysis may also be utilized to determine acceptable system damping. Acceptable
damping with time domain analysis requires running a transient stability simulation for sufficient time
(up to 30 seconds) such that only a single mode of oscillation remains. A 53% reduction in the
magnitude of the oscillation must then be observed over four periods of the oscillation, measuring from
the point where only a single mode of oscillation remains in the simulation.

As an alternate method, the time domain response of system state quantities such as generator rotor
angle, voltage, and interface transfers can be transformed into the frequency domain where the
damping ratio can be calculated.

A sufficient number of system state quantities including rotor angle, voltage, and interface transfers
should be analyzed to ensure that adequate system damping is observed.

PTF Cost Review

## Procedure for Pool-Supported PTF Cost Review[1]

1.0 General

This procedure (PP4) provides detailed guidance, pursuant to the ISO New England
Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (the Tariff), regarding the cost review of those
necessary regulated transmission solution additions and modifications, reconstructions or
replacements (referred to herein as Projects[2]) of Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF) that
are eligible for regional cost support: including Regional Benefit Upgrades (RBUs);[3]
Public Policy Transmission Upgrades;[4] and reconstruction/replacement of the PTF.

Under Section II.50 and Schedule 12 of Section II - Open Access Transmission Tariff
(OATT) of the Tariff, ISO New England Inc. (ISO) with advisory input from the Reliability
Committee (RC) will determine whether there are Localized Costs to be excluded from
Pool-Supported PTF revenue requirements.

This Planning Procedure provides guidance on: what Projects are subject to cost review;
what information the applicant for cost review (the Applicant) must provide to the ISO; the
process for RC and ISO review of an Applicant’s Project; the factors that will be considered
in determining whether there are Localized Costs associated with a Project; and the
periodic reporting of costs associated with a Project by the Applicant.

This Planning Procedure also provides an Applicant with guidelines for preparing a
Transmission Cost Allocation (TCA) application (TCA Application) for use by the ISO
and the RC. The Applicant must support the TCA Application with the necessary
information and analysis of the Project. This procedure provides guidance on what
information and analysis is to be supplied in support a TCA Application. The submittal of
a completed TCA Application form provided in Attachment B – TCA Form (Attachment
B)[5] to this Procedure and any supporting materials describing and assessing the impact of
the proposed Project together shall constitute submittal of a TCA Application.

1 Capitalized terms used in this Procedure are intended to have the same meaning given to such terms in
Section I.2.2 of the Tariff.
2 For the purposes of this Planning Procedure, a Project is a plan, program, or grouping of Transmission
Upgrades as they are identified in the RSP Project List or the Asset Condition Project List as a single
project.
3 As defined in Section I.2.2 of the Tariff, an RBU is a Transmission Upgrade that: is rated 115 kV or
above; meets all of the non-voltage criteria for PTF classification specified in the OATT; and is included in
the Regional System Plan as either a Reliability Transmission Upgrade or an Market Efficiency
Transmission Upgrade.
4 As defined in Section I.2.2 of the Tariff, a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade is an addition and/or
upgrade to the New England Transmission System that meets the voltage and non-voltage criteria for
Public Policy Transmission Upgrade PTF classification specified in the OATT, and has been included in
the Regional System Plan and RSP Project List as a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade pursuant to the
procedures described in Section 4A of Attachment K of the OATT.

PTF Cost Review

Approval of a TCA Application by the ISO informs an Applicant of the approved Project
costs that may be included in Pool-Supported PTF revenue requirements subject to the
terms and conditions in the OATT. An ISO finding of Localized Costs does not prohibit
an Applicant from recovering such expenditures elsewhere in the OATT.

This Planning Procedure shall be submitted to the review of the RC, no less than every five
years or at the request of the RC, to evaluate the appropriateness of the minimum threshold
set out in section 1.1.2 of this Planning Procedure.

1.1 Projects Requiring a TCA Application

1.1.1. Categories of Projects requiring TCA Application

TCA Applications are required for the following types of Projects that are
seeking regional cost support:

(1) an RBU identified in the Regional System Plan or Regional System Plan

Project List (including those selected as part of the Competitive
Solutions Process);

(2) one or more plans that otherwise require submittal for review under

Tariff Section I.3.9 and that address the same system need as an RBU
as identified in the Regional System Plan or Regional System Plan
Project list;

(3) reconstruction/replacement of PTF that does not require approval under

Tariff Section I.3.9 but that has a total estimated PTF portion of the
Project cost greater than or equal to $5 Million;

(4) a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade identified in the Regional System

Plan or Regional System Plan Project List;

(5) an Asset Condition Project[6] identified in the Asset Condition Project

List (as further described in Attachment G)

Although the Project may be projected over any time frame to demonstrate
prudent planning, action on TCA Applications will only be taken on plans

6 For more details on requirements for asset condition projects, see the Section 6.3 of the Transmission
Planning Process Guide:
[https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2022/11/transmission_planning_process_guide.pdf](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2022/11/transmission_planning_process_guide.pdf)

PTF Cost Review

that have begun construction or are expected to begin construction no later
than five (5) years after the date of the TCA Application submittal.

Generally, an Applicant must file a single TCA Application for its Project,[7]
as identified in the Regional System Plan or Asset Condition List. The ISO
may, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, allow multiple TCA
Applications for individual components of a single Project. The Applicant
must discuss their intent with the ISO prior to submitting multiple
applications for different components of a single Project.

A TCA Application must be submitted to recover qualified, incurred PTF
expenditures on a Project identified in this Section 1.1.1. that has been
cancelled by the ISO. Costs associated with such a project will be reviewed
in accordance with Schedule 12C, as applicable.

1.1.2. Exemptions from TCA Application Requirements

If a Project is not identified in Section 1.1.1 above, or if the total estimated
PTF portion of the Project cost is less than $5,000,000,[8] then the Applicant
does not need to file a TCA Application unless the actual costs exceed
$5,000,000. The ISO may request that a TCA Application be submitted for
Projects that are less than $5,000,000 if the potential for significant
localized costs (as described in Attachment A) exists.

1.1.3. Projects not subject to this Procedure

This Review Process does not pertain to:

1. Schedule 11 of Section II of the Tariff, Category C Generator

Interconnection Related Upgrades (GIRUs);

2. Elective Transmission Upgrades;
3. Local Benefit Upgrades;
4. Recovery of Localized Costs; and
5. Merchant Transmission Facilities or their interconnection.

1.2 Guidance for completion of TCA Application and Supporting Materials

7 Determination on a Project will only be made once all parts of the Project (no matter if it is from one
Applicant or multiple) have been presented and acted upon by the RC.
8 When a Project’s cost is over the minimum TCA threshold, a TCA(s) must be submitted for all
components that make up the Project for ISO and RC review, even if the estimated costs are less than $5M
for an individual component.

PTF Cost Review

The complexity of proposed changes to the transmission system can range
from minor changes to major alterations. The intent of the PP4 process is
to match information required as part of a TCA Application, to the review
effort, and relative cost of the Project. Section 1.5 below provides guidance
as to the level of information required in a TCA Application. The TCA
Application, and any supporting documents, shall also reflect the cost
information as illustrated in Appendix D – Project Cost Estimating
Guidelines.[9] The Applicant may request further guidance or preliminary
review of Project-related information from the ISO and the RC prior to
submitting a formal TCA Application.

1.3 Special Consideration of Submitted Materials

Should any documentation be submitted that is considered confidential by
the Applicant, it is the responsibility of the Applicant to describe to the ISO,
by name, the documents to be considered confidential. All information
marked as confidential will be controlled in accordance with the ISO New
England Information Policy.

Documents submitted that contain Critical Energy Infrastructure
Information (CEII) materials, as deemed by the Applicant, should be noted
as such and will be posted appropriately. To the extent possible, TCA
materials provided for review should be void of CEII materials.

Due to the nature of Projects that are required to comply with [NERC](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-014-2.pdf)
[Reliability Standard CIP-014 - Physical Security (CIP-014),[10] the Applicant](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-014-2.pdf)
shall submit to ISO un-redacted and redacted versions of the completed
TCA Application and supporting materials. The un-redacted version shall
be used by ISO for its review and determination. The redacted version of
the Application and supporting materials[11] shall exclude sensitive
information, including the name of the substation(s) where upgrades are
occurring, as release of this information represents a severe reliability threat
to the transmission system. This redacted version shall be provided by ISO
to the RC for its review and action.

The redacted TCA Application will automatically be created when the
Applicant inputs information in the TCA Application form, Attachment B

9 https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp04_0/pp4_0_attachment_d.pdf
10 The purpose of CIP-014 is “to identify and protect Transmission stations and Transmission substations,
and their associated primary control centers, that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical
attack could result in instability, uncontrolled separation, or Cascading within an Interconnection.”
11 The redacted version shall mask information that is considered more sensitive than that which is CEII
and therefore cannot be viewed by those individuals who are approved to receive CEII materials.

to this PP4. This functionality will provide for a consistent CIP-014 TCA
Application across all Applicants.

1.4 Roles of PAC, RC and ISO in TCA Application Review Process

1.4.1 In advance of the submittal of a completed TCA Application, the
Planning Advisory Committee (PAC) shall review proposed solutions and
may offer advisory input to the ISO as to the most cost effective and
reliable solutions for the region that meet a need identified in a Needs
Assessment through the Regional System Planning Process. This
information will be used by the Project proponent (i.e., Transmission
Owner) at a later date when developing a TCA Application.

1.4.2 The RC, or its designee, will review TCA Applications and the RC
will make an advisory recommendation to the ISO as to whether there are
Localized Costs associated with the Project that should not be supported as
Pool-Supported PTF costs. Localized Costs will be identified by the RC
based on the rules for PTF determination as defined in Attachment F of the
Tariff and section 1.6.2 of this procedure.

1.4.3 The ISO will consider the RC’s advisory recommendation in
making its determination of whether there are Localized Costs associated
with the Project that should not be included as Pool-Supported PTF costs.

1.4.4 The Applicant of Category 4 or 5 TCA Application (as identified in
Section 1.5, Table 1, of this Procedure) must provide an update each year
following the completed TCA submittal, until the project is complete and
in-service, to the ISO and RC with regard to construction progress and costs.
In addition, the Applicant may be asked by the ISO to provide a Project
update to the PAC. A PAC update will utilize the forms in Attachment D
of this procedure. An Applicant will not be asked to update the PAC more
than three times in a calendar year regarding the status of a Project,
regardless if the Project has one or several TCA’s associated with it. The
final cost update shall include the actual, completed cost of the Project.

1.5 Evaluation

Based on the total estimated PTF portion of the cost of the Project, five (5)
categories of analysis are identified in Table 1 below for supporting a
particular Project (ranging from no analysis for exempt Projects to full costs
analyses of transmission alternatives). The ISO and/or the RC may also,
however, request that the Applicant provide additional information in
support of the TCA Application. The analysis categories are summarized as
follows:

PTF Cost Review

1.6 Submittal of a completed TCA Application

Completed TCA Applications and supporting materials shall be submitted
via e-mail to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C to this Procedure) and
shall be submitted per the described timelines in Section 1.5 above, the
guidelines within this section and Section 2.0 below, in order to provide the
RC sufficient time to review the TCA Application before the requested
action date. The timelines provided in this PP4 are intended to provide
guidance to the Applicant, the RC and the ISO but do not bind the RC or
the ISO to take any action.

The TCA Application for a Project, or individual components as provided
under Section 1.1.1 above, will be submitted to the ISO prior to the start of
Major Construction. If the Applicant determines that a TCA cannot be
submitted before Major Construction commences, the Applicant will provide
to the RC a project and preliminary cost update within six months after that
determination and thereafter at least annually. The TCA shall be submitted
before the start of Major Construction for the final element of the Project.

Major Construction means that all major permits are issued, major contracts
secured and either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure
on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of manufactured equipment on a foundation. Major construction
does not include land preparation activities, such as clearing, grading,
installation of access or any excavation nor does it include the erection of
temporary structures or the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or work trailers that are not part of the main structure.

In a Force Majeure or Emergency event TCA Application(s) may be submitted
after a Project is placed into service but should be submitted to the ISO no later
than one year after a Project is placed into service.

1.6.1 Review of a completed TCA Application by ISO and the RC

An Applicant is encouraged to discuss their completed TCA Application
and supporting documentation with the ISO to ensure completeness prior to
submittal for review.

A completed TCA Application, and supporting documentation, shall be
submitted electronically to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C to this
Procedure), who will collect, distribute, and provide a permanent record of
the TCA Application.

Upon receipt and review of a TCA Application, the ISO will notify the
Applicant if the submitted TCA Application is incomplete or additional
information is required.

10


-----

PTF Cost Review

A typical completed TCA Application will include the following:

(a) Cover Letter (including when action by the RC is requested);
(b) Completed TCA Application form (Attachment B); and
(c) Additional details and supporting documentation pertaining to:

1) A review and discussion of the need for the proposed Project.

          - Note: To the extent that the needs analysis was conducted

during the planning process (i.e., Regional System Plan (RSP)),
a summary of that analysis may be considered sufficient.

2) A summary of the technical analysis performed for the Project and

the identified transmission alternatives.

3) A discussion of why the Project was selected over other

transmission alternatives, with a description of the benefits of the
proposed Project over other transmission alternatives from an
operational, timing of implementation, cost and reliability
perspective.

(i) The proposed Project, and any feasible and practical

transmission alternatives that were considered, including those
offered in the most recent RSP report and, if applicable,
discussed at the PAC.

Note: A feasible and practical transmission alternative means
a transmission alternative that is feasible and practical from
an engineering design and construction perspective. An
alternative that is not or may not be approved by a siting or
local review board may still be considered a feasible and
practical transmission alternative.

(ii) The most currently available cost estimates[14] of building the

Project and, if required, transmission alternatives that were
considered, including overall costs and categorized as identified
in Attachment D of this procedure.[15];

(iii)A comparison of the potential operational impacts on the bulk

power system during construction of the Project with any
feasible and practical transmission alternatives that were
considered;

(iv)A comparison of the potential operating costs of the Project and

any feasible and practical transmission alternatives that were
considered; and

(v) Design considerations affecting maintenance, construction

and/or future expansion of the Project.

14 All dollar amounts shall be expressed in year of expenditure dollars and based on the project anticipated
schedule. Escalation shall be included and be clearly identified with the assumption stated (escalation rate
applied to the project). Alternatives and preferred Project shall be stated in the same valuation year.
15 For each categorization of costs, year incurred shall be identified.

(d) Before and after one-line diagrams and a map locating the facilities[16].
(e) Correlation Table which identifies the project driver, RSP or ACL

Project ID, including sub-components, Proposed Plan Applications and
relevant TCA Application description/costs as shown in Attachment E
to this Planning Procedure

(f) Any additional relevant information requested by the ISO or the RC.

The Applicant has an ongoing responsibility to update any TCA Application
when additional information relevant to review of the TCA Application
becomes available prior to RC review and issuance of the ISO’s written
findings and determination.

1.6.2 Considerations

1.6.2.1 In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for
Projects that are not developed through the competitive transmission
process pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4A of Attachment K (except for
Projects, as described in Section 1.6.2.2, that are located on a PTO’s existing
transmission system, where the Selected Qualified Transmission Project
Sponsor is not the PTO for the existing system element(s)), the ISO, with
advisory input from the RC, will consider the reasonableness of the
proposed design and construction method with respect to:

(a) Good Utility Practice;
(b) Current engineering design and construction practices in the area in

which the Project is proposed to be built/is being built;

(c) Allowance for appropriate expansion and load growth;
(d) Alternate feasible and practical transmission alternatives; and
(e) The relative costs, operation, efficiency, reliability and timing of

implementation of the proposed Project.

Attachment A to this Procedure provides examples of relevant
considerations for determination of Localized Costs.

1.6.2.2 In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for a
project developed through the competitive transmission solutions process
pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4A of Attachment K, the ISO with advisory
input from the RC, will consider the Project described in Schedule A to the
Selected Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor Agreement compared to
what is submitted in the Transmission Cost Allocation application for
regional rate recovery. Localized Costs for the Transmission Upgrades
identified in the Project that are located on a PTO’s existing transmission
system, where the Selected Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor is not
the PTO for the existing system element(s), will be determined in a manner

16 If these documents were already submitted to the ISO as part of a Proposed Plan Application, they do not
need to be re-submitted.

12


-----

PTF Cost Review

consistent with the process described for the Transmission Upgrades
identified in Section 1.6.2.1 above.

1.6.3 Additional Costs Due to Regulatory or Public Requirements

The Applicant shall identify in their TCA Application any additional
proposed Pool-Supported PTF costs introduced as a result of local or state
regulatory and/or legislative requirements. The ISO will then determine,
with the advice of the RC, whether these incremental costs resulting from
the requirements of any local or state regulatory and/or legislative
requirements will be identified as Localized Costs.

If the Applicant has received an advisory vote from the RC on a TCA
Application, and has not begun or completed the siting process, the
Applicant is required to provide periodic updates to both the RC and the
ISO on those proceedings and a presentation on the final design of the
Project. If, after siting is complete, there is a major design change and/or
changes to the Project that could result in Localized Costs, the Applicant
shall report the design change to both the RC and the ISO and discuss with
the ISO whether the change requires that the Applicant submit an amended
TCA Application.

1.7 Time Guidelines

Applicants are urged to supply the completed TCA Application and
supporting data, with adequate lead times for anticipated review by the RC
and ISO as described in Sections 1.5 and 1.6 above.  Failure to follow these
timeframes may result in a delay of review of the TCA Application.

1.8 Actions on a TCA Application

1.8.1 RC Review and Action

At the request of the Applicant, the ISO will forward a submitted TCA and
supporting materials to the RC for its review and action. The ISO shall also
include a draft motion for the RC to consider when taking action on any
advisory input related to the determination of whether any costs associated
with such upgrade are Localized Costs

On each submitted TCA Application, the RC will provide a
recommendation and act upon a motion describing the identification and
conditions of treatment of Localized costs, if any, associated with the
Project.

If in reviewing the TCA Application, the RC decides additional
information, review, or study is required prior to acting on the Application,

13


-----

PTF Cost Review

the RC may elect to defer action and solicit supplementary information,
review, or study as required.

Therefore, the RC may defer action, determine that no Localized Costs have
been identified by the RC and recommend approval of the TCA Application
by the ISO, or recommend a determination of Localized Costs by the ISO.

If the Applicant seeks advisory input by the Participants Committee, it may
request TCA Application review by the Participants Committee after the
RC meeting but before the fifth (5[th]) business day following a meeting of
the RC. The request for Participants Committee review and advisory input
shall be submitted in writing by the Applicant to the Secretary of the RC
with a copy sent to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C).

1.8.1 ISO Review and Determination

The ISO will consider the recommendations of the RC, and the Participants
Committee as appropriate, in the process of making a determination on each
TCA Application. The ISO may also seek additional information from the
Applicant before or after RC or Participants Committee action but prior to
making its decision. The ISO will transmit, in a timely manner, its written
findings, the basis for its decision, and is determination as to whether the
submitted TCA Application contains any associated Localized Costs to the
Applicant (with copy to the RC).

For a Category 5 TCA Application (as shown in Table 1) the ISO will issue
a draft determination letter that will be posted on the ISO’s website[17] for a
30 day comment period. During the comment period the Applicant or any
interested Stakeholder may send written comments to the ISO regarding the
ISO’s determination decision. After the comment period has ended the
comments will be reviewed and the ISO will issue a final determination on
the TCA Application.

If the Applicant disagrees with the ISO’s written findings and
determination, the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 1.11
below shall be followed.

1.9 Withdrawal of a TCA Application

Should an Applicant wish to withdraw or terminate its TCA Application,
(either before or after determination action has been taken by the ISO) it
shall send a letter to that effect to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C).
The ISO will distribute the notice of withdrawal to the RC.

PTF Cost Review

    - Where a Proposed Plan Application was not required, but a TCA

Application was submitted, the ISO issued a written findings and
determination and the Project was cancelled, the TCA Applicant must
provide written notification to ISO within 60-days of such cancellation,
requesting withdrawal of the approved TCA Application.

    - Where a Proposed Plan Application was required, and a TCA

Application was submitted, the ISO issued a written findings and
determination and the Project was cancelled, the TCA Application will
automatically be withdrawn upon notification of withdrawal of the
Proposed Plan Application.

    - If a Project is canceled by the ISO, and regardless of whether a Proposed

Plan Application was required, an Applicant must submit a TCA
Application for costs that were incurred prior to cancellation of the
Project if the Applicant seeks to recover those costs through the RNS
rate.

1.10 Reviews and Update of Approved TCA Applications

The RC and the ISO will review an updated TCA Application for the
proposed Project, as described below.

The Applicant is responsible to inform the ISO of any significant additional
Pool-Supported PTF costs or any material changes in the design associated
with a proposed Project made subsequent to approval of the TCA
Application. Such information shall be delivered to the ISO by submitting
a revised TCA Application, including the reasons for resubmission in
accordance with the template of Attachment D. Specifically, an Applicant,
which has already received approval of its original TCA Application, must
notify both the RC and the ISO if either: (i) costs have exceeded or are
anticipated to exceed 10% of the amount determined by the ISO to be
included in Pool-Supported PTF costs; (ii) costs have decreased or are
anticipated to decrease by 10% of the amount determined by the ISO to be
included in Pool-Supported PTF costs; or (iii) there is a material change in
design of the Project. In the case that Pool-Supported PTF costs have
decreased by 10% or more, a revised TCA application does not need to be
filed but information must be provided to the ISO and RC, in a timely
manner, using the templates in Attachment D which identify and explain
cost variance to the original TCA estimate. If an Applicant fails to notify
the ISO of any of these developments, and it is discovered, such as during
an audit, then the costs associated with such development will be excluded
from the Pool-Supported PTF until the process described in this Procedure
has been followed and the ISO accepts the costs following appropriate

15


-----

PTF Cost Review

review by the RC and the ISO. In such instance, the costs shall be recovered
only prospectively pursuant to the Tariff.

1.11 Dispute Resolution

Should the Applicant disagree with the ISO’s written findings and
determination as described in Section 1.8 above, a dispute may be filed.

As stated in Section 3 of Schedule 12C to the OATT, disputes shall be
submitted in a formal written notice to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment
C). Such notice shall describe in detail the basis for challenging the ISO’s
written findings and determination, and must be submitted within 60 days
of receipt of the ISO’s written findings and determination. The Applicant
and the ISO will then enter into good faith negotiations for a period not to
exceed 60 days from the date of the Applicant’s written notice to try to
resolve the dispute. If there is no resolution of the dispute at the end of the
negotiation period, the Applicant may file a Section 206 complaint with the
Commission.

The ISO shall notify the RC of the outcome of the dispute resolution
process.

2.0 TCA Application Forms

2.1. Completed TCA Application Content

A completed form of TCA Application in Attachment B must be submitted
with each TCA Application as outlined in Section 1.6 above. Any included
supporting documentation should supplement the TCA Application.

2.2 TCA Application Identification

PTF Cost Review

**Attachment A**

**Supplemental Guidelines for Pool-Supported PTF Cost Review**

In determining whether there are Localized Costs, the ISO will consider as appropriate and
with the advisory input of the RC, the following non-exclusive list of factors:

1. Costs of construction including all costs associated with rights of way,

easements and associated real estate.

2. Assessment of the schedule or in-service date of the Project from an engineering

and construction standpoint rather than from the standpoint of potential delays
in local or state siting.

3. Relative reliability and operational impacts of the Project as compared to

alternatives considered.

4. Costs associated with operation and maintenance of the proposed design and

alternatives, including consideration of whether the proposed design is
consistent with Good Utility Practice.

5. Costs of related and long-term congestion impacts, if any, of each proposed

PTF and Non-PTF design alternative, including costs related to outages
associated with construction.

6. The proposed design’s fit into reasonable future expansion plans, including the

Regional System Plan.

7. Consistency with current engineering, design and construction practices in the

area.

The following, non-exclusive list of examples is provided for illustration of the types of
Projects that would be considered to contain Localized Costs:

1. The Project costs more than a feasible or practical transmission alternative and

has equal or less robust bulk power system performance than the transmission
alternative.

2. A Reliability Transmission Upgrade (excluding Asset Condition and

reconstruction/ replacement Projects) that does not address a need identified in
a Needs Assessment through the Regional System Planning Process.

3. The Project includes one or more underground transmission cables, which is

selected (a) at the direction of a local or state siting board or (b) to address other
local concerns, and the cost of overhead transmission lines is less expensive,
taking into account all relevant costs.

4. The Project is a gas-insulated or covered substation when an open-air substation

would be feasible and practical for lower cost.

5. Installation of one or more Independent Pole Tripping breakers at a substation

operating at less than 345 kV without a stability need.

6. The Project includes spare equipment or spare conduits.
7. Costs associated with local or state siting board initiated visual mitigation that

go beyond Good Utility Practice.

8. The Project includes construction in a flood hazard area that exceeds the

Attachment H recommendation to this planning procedure.

PTF Cost Review

The following, non-exclusive list of examples is provided for illustration of the types of
Projects that are not likely to contain Localized Costs.

1. The Project includes one or more underground transmission cables but the total

cost of the underground transmission cable Project is lower than a feasible and
practical overhead transmission line, the operating and maintenance costs are
comparable, and the reliability benefits provided by the underground cable are
equal to or better than those provided by the overhead line.

2. The Project has higher total cost than feasible and practical transmission

alternatives, but provides for more robust bulk power system performance
consistent with the Regional System Plan planning horizon and predicted load
growth when compared to such transmission alternatives.

3. Installation of one or more Independent Pole Tripping breakers at a substation

operating at less than 345 kV where the effects of a three-phase breaker failure
contingency shows unacceptable inter-area impact.

4. Installation of one or more Independent Pole Tripping breakers at a 345 kV

substation.

5. When the failure of a breaker violates planning criteria or produces

unacceptable operational consequences that are solved by the installation of a
series breaker, the series breaker cost will be deemed acceptable.

**Common Additional Information Questions**

The following are some of the common questions that are asked as part of the TCA
Application review. Providing answers to the following question within a completed TCA
Application will aid the RC and ISO in the rendering of a Localized Cost determination.

- Explaining if there were any cost “adders” (elements of the Project not directly related to

electrical facilities such as park land, trees, bike paths, etc) to the proposed Project that

were not directly related to the electrical facilities.

- Providing a complete explanation for the choice of transmission line construction design

(i.e. mono-pole vs. H-frame or underground vs. overhead).as

- Providing a cost breakdown of the per-mile cost of the transmission line (overhead or

underground).

- Describe any local or state siting issues or requirements.

- Describe any construction and/or design challenges that were encountered or are

anticipated to be encountered for the proposed project.

- Describing any differences between the proposed Project as described in the TCA

Application and what is described in the most recent RSP.

**Attachment G**

**Guidance for Submission of TCA Applications for Asset Condition Projects**

In support of Section 1.1.1(5) of PP4, this guideline shall be utilized by asset owners for the
purpose of determining when (i) a Transmission Cost Allocation application submittal is
required and (ii) a supporting PAC presentation is required for Asset Condition Projects,
which are projects identified in the Asset Condition Project List that have estimated or
actual PTF costs that are greater than or equal to $5M for a specific need. The entire
process can be seen in the flowchart below.

**Asset Condition Project Categories and examples:**

**1.** **For the purpose of this Attachment G, Asset Condition Projects may be**

**categorized as follows:**

  - A substation project is defined as “work done inside the fence” with an expected

PTF cost greater than or equal to $5M for a specified need over the course of a 5
year period or less.

  - A line project is defined as work being done on each line with an expected PTF

cost of greater than or equal to $5M for a specified need over the course of a 5
year period or less.

2. **Asset Condition Projects with an actual PTF cost of greater than or equal to $5M**

for a specified need over the course of a 5 year period, or less, for a specified need:
Even if the estimated PTF costs for an Asset Condition Project were less than $5M for
a specified need, if the actual PTF expenditures are greater than or equal to $5M over
the course of the 5 year, or less, period, then the asset owner is required to submit a
TCA Application and make a presentation at the PAC.

3. **Example - Line work required in addition to that within the original Asset**

**Condition project scope: If the asset owner determines that the scope of Project A is**
to replace 50 structures on a single line with an expected PTF cost of $8M, then they
are required to submit a TCA Application for review and present at the PAC. The
project scope calls for a construction schedule for Project A to have an expected start in
year X and be completed in year X+2. As construction for Project A is ongoing, the
asset owner identifies 20 additional structures as being in need of replacement in years
X+4 and X+5. The 20 additional structures are not considered part of the original
scope Project A, therefore the 20 additional structures will be replaced under Project B.
If Project B has an expected PTF cost of $5M or greater, then a TCA Application
submittal and PAC presentation will be required. If the expected PTF cost of Project B
is less than $5M, then no TCA Application submittal or PAC presentation is required.

**Attachment H**

**Guidance for Submission of TCA Applications for Projects in Flood Hazard Areas**

In order to be eligible for regional cost recovery to elevate PTF equipment, a screening test must be
performed in order to show that the existing sensitive PTF equipment is impacted by the current 100
year flood level as shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FEMA FIRM)[19] maps without any additional adder or sea level rise adder. In addition to the
FEMA FIRM maps, a site specific survey that shows that the location is impacted by flooding when
the FEMA FIRM maps have not been updated to adequately keep up with current conditions may be
provided to the ISO as part of the screening test. A TCA Application for a Project that addresses
equipment impacted by the 100 year flood level shall be accompanied by the results of this screening
test. Failure to provide the screening test may result in Localized Costs.

Regional cost recovery for projects to elevate existing PTF equipment or to add new PTF equipment
impacted by the 100 year flood level shall be considered acceptable under the following conditions:

   - Inland locations – defined as areas that have no chance for “wave action” on the FEMA
FIRM map

             - The elevation level is the higher of the 100 year flood level plus 3 feet or
500 year flood level plus 1 foot

   - Coastal Locations

             - The elevation level is the higher of the 100 year flood level plus 3 feet or
500 year flood level plus 1 foot

             - Plus an additional 1 foot added for sea level rise[20]

_Note: The costs to elevate PTF equipment higher than the above levels shall not be regionalized_

   - For existing PTF equipment that is raised, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs
recovery to elevate the bottom of sensitive equipment[21] to the applicable elevation level
noted above

– Example: The control cabinet of a transformer would be at the elevation listed above

while the lower end of the transformer would be below. The bottom of the
transformer could be submerged in water during storm events

   - For new PTF construction, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs recovery to
elevate the bottom of the equipment to the applicable elevation level noted above

– Example: The bottom of the transformer would be at the higher of the two values

shown above

   - For control houses, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs recovery to elevate the
control house floor to the applicable elevation level noted above for new construction for
both existing PTF and new PTF

[19 FEMA FIRM map address search https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search)
20 In cases where a site-specific survey initiated the work, the additional 1 foot adder for future sea level rise
can only be added if the survey does not already take into account future sea level rise.
21 Sensitive equipment shall mean any equipment that cannot be submerged in water for any amount of time.

_considered eligible for cost recovery if the 100 year screening test is met and the cost is_
_equal to or less than elevating the equipment._
