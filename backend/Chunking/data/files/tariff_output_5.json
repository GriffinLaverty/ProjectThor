That means deciding who pays for regulated (not merchant) transmission projects, in a collaborative and transparent process, as follows:\n\n\n1. Transmission owners (TOs) submit a TCA application for projects that qualify for regional rate recovery.\n2. The ISO reviews all costs proposed to be included in the regional rate, pursuant to the [ISO Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff). Along with deciding whether regional cost support is justified, the ISO will consider whether costs are reasonable and in accordance with good utility practice.\n3. The ISO seeks and considers advisory input from the [Reliability Committee](https://www.iso-ne.com/committees/reliability/reliability-committee) on potential localized costs associated with the project. For larger projects, an open stakeholder meeting may be held at the ISO’s discretion.\n4. The ISO makes a determination of whether the project costs should be regionalized and/or localized:\n* **Regionalized costs**—Projects that will improve reliability throughout the region provide a benefit for all of New England, and their costs are shared by the region. A region’s share of the costs is proportionate to its electricity demand.\n* **Localized costs**—Portions of a project that do not provide a regional reliability benefit are typically the responsibility of the transmission owner. Examples of localized costs can be found in Attachment A of Planning Procedure 4\\.\n\n\nFor details, please see these resources:\n\n\n* [The ISO Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff)\n* [ISO Planning Procedure 4](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2020/02/pp_4_rev9.pdf): Procedure for Pool\\-Supported PTF Cost Review\n* [ISO Planning Procedure 4\\-1](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/pp4_1_rev_2.pdf): Cost Responsibility for Transmission Upgrades With Multiple Needs\n\n\n"},

For the purposes of this\nPlanning Procedure, DER refers any generator or energy storage facility located on the distribution system,\nany subsystem thereof, or behind a customer meter that is capable of providing energy injection, energy\nwithdrawal, regulation or demand reduction.[1] Examples of these DER facilities are: solar photovoltaic\ngeneration (either behind a retail customer’s meter or as a stand-alone facility connecting directly to the\ndistribution system), wind, hydroelectric, combined heat and power, fuel cells, battery energy storage\nsystems, or hybrid facilities containing multiple technologies at a single location. The boundary of a DER\nfacility is considered the point of common coupling between the facility’s equipment and the Distribution\nProvider.\n\nIn light of the large number and cumulative capacity of these resources on New England’s power system, ISO\nNew England collects basic data on these facilities (size, physical location, electrical location, type, in-service\ndate, and other characteristics) for use in many applications. This data is used as an input to both long- and\nshort-term load forecasts, power system modeling, transmission planning and transmission service studies,\noperational studies, and the Energy Management System, among other uses. Availability of this data leads to\nmore accuracy in planning and operating the transmission system, as well as more efficient outcomes of\nthese processes.\n\n#### 2.0 Applicable Entities\n\nThis Planning Procedure is applicable to the following types of entities:\n\n  - **ISO New England: As the Planning Coordinator and Reliability Coordinator for the New England area,**\nISO New England leads the process for DER data collection. ISO New England distributes the initial\nrequest three times per year, screens submissions for conformance with the data format, and sends\ninquiries to Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners as necessary to resolve any missing or\nconflicting data.\n\n  - **Distribution Providers:[2]** As the entities to which DERs connect, Distribution Providers are responsible\nfor providing facility-level data to ISO New England for all DERs connected to their system.\n\n  - **Transmission Owners: Transmission Owners are responsible for providing data used to translate**\nfeeders in the Distribution Providers’ data into locations identified in various frameworks used by ISO\n\n1 Generation or storage facilities that are used solely to provide backup power when a customer is disconnected from the\ndistribution system, and do not inject or discharge power when synchronized with the distribution system, are not considered\nDER for the purposes of this Planning Procedure. Data does not need to be submitted to ISO-NE for these facilities.\n\n2 For the purposes of this planning procedure, a “Distribution Provider” is defined as operating the “wires” between the\ntransmission system and the end-use customer. The term is not defined by a specific voltage, but rather as performing the\ndistribution function at any voltage. Note that while this definition is similar to NERC’s definition of the same term (see NERC\n[Glossary of Terms, https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf), the definition of](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf)\nDistribution Provider for the purposes of this Planning Procedure is not dependent on the Distribution Provider’s peak load\nserved, in contrast to NERC’s use of a minimum size threshold for NERC registration purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### g g Distributed Energy Resources\n\nNew England, including PSS®E bus numbers and substation identifiers used in the Energy\nManagement System and market applications.\n\nUpon mutual agreement between a Distribution Provider and a Transmission Owner, either party may submit\nthe data required in this procedure on behalf of the other.\n\n#### 3.0 Data Collection Timeline\n\nThe collection of DER data shall occur three times per year, according to the following approximate dates.\nDates may be adjusted as needed to avoid conflicts such as weekends and holidays. Data shall reflect all DER\nconnected to the Distribution Provider’s system on the date listed in the second row of the table below, as\nwell as any proposed facilities in the Distribution Provider’s interconnection queue or equivalent list of\ninterconnection requests on that date.\n\n**Procedure Step** **December Data Collection** **April Data Collection** **August Data Collection**\n\nISO-NE distributes data December 15 April 15 August 15\nrequest to Distribution\nProviders and\nTransmission Owners\n\nSubmit all DER December 31 April 30 August 31\ninterconnected and\nproposed as of:\n\nDistribution Providers January 21 May 21 September 21\nand Transmission\nOwners respond to ISONE data request\n\nThe first data collection under this procedure will occur in January 2025, and Distribution Providers and\nTransmission Owners shall submit data by the January 21 due date. As part of that collection, ISO New\nEngland shall work with data submitters after this date to identify any data quality and data formatting issues,\nand these issues may be remedied after the January 21 date. For all subsequent data collections under this\nprocedure, Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners shall submit data in the proper format by the\ndates listed in last row of the table above.\n\n#### 4.0 Data Collection Process\n\n 4.1 Initial Request from ISO New England\n\nISO New England shall request data from Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners according to the\nschedule above. Along with the issuance of the data request, ISO New England shall provide a copy of the\nmost recent version of the feeder information table in Appendix B to this Planning Procedure to each\nTransmission Owner, as a starting point for their submission(s).\n\n|Procedure Step|December Data Collection|April Data Collection|August Data Collection|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|ISO-NE distributes data request to Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners|December 15|April 15|August 15|\n|Submit all DER interconnected and proposed as of:|December 31|April 30|August 31|\n|Distribution Providers and Transmission Owners respond to ISO- NE data request|January 21|May 21|September 21|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### g g Distributed Energy Resources\n 4.2 Distribution Provider Submissions\n\nEach Distribution Provider shall submit the best available[3] data for each DER facility connected to its system.\nThis data shall be submitted in the format given in Appendix A to this Planning Procedure.

When a DER has been disconnected from the\ndistribution system or retired, the Distribution Provider shall include the facility in the following data\nsubmission, with a status of “Retired.” Inclusion of retired DERs in subsequent submissions is at the discretion\nof the Distribution Provider.\n\nAll DERs shall be included in this data submission, regardless of size, type, or other characteristics. Facilities\nthat are already modeled generator assets in ISO-NE systems need not be included, but may be included at\nthe discretion of the Distribution Provider. These modeled generator assets are explicitly modeled in ISO New\nEngland’s Energy Management System and market systems. ISO New England shall account for any overlap\nbetween DER data submissions and modeled generators when processing Distribution Providers’ data\nsubmissions.\n\n#### 4.3 Transmission Owner Submissions\n\nEach Transmission Owner shall submit data describing the electrical location of each feeder listed in the\nDistribution Provider’s submission, according to the format given in Appendix B of this Planning Procedure.\n\n#### 4.4 ISO New England Receipt and Validation of Data\n\nFollowing the submission of data from each Distribution Provider and Transmission Owner, ISO New England\nshall review the data, and return any data determined to be invalid, conflicting, or unclear to the appropriate\nparty for review and revision if necessary. In addition, any new feeders listed in the Distribution Provider’s\ndata shall be submitted to the Transmission Owner, so that data can be provided to ISO-NE for the new\nfeeder according to Appendix B of this Planning Procedure.\n\n#### 5.0 Revision History\n\n Rev. 0 Approved: RC – 7/16/24; NPC – 8/1/24; ISO-NE – 8/14/24\n\n3 The data request as part of this procedure may be compiled from Distribution Providers’ interconnection queues or similar\nrecords, and it is understood that some details (such as in-service dates, maximum DC generation for solar facilities, or installed\nenergy capacity for storage facilities) may change as a project is developed and constructed. ISO New England’s expectation is\nthat distribution providers will provide the most up-to-date information available to them, and there is no requirement for\ndistribution providers to conduct field verification of these quantities, or to retroactively provide unavailable data for\npreviously interconnected facilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### g g Distributed Energy Resources\n\n 6.0 Appendix A: Submission Format for Facility Data\n\nAppendix A is provided in a separate Excel workbook.

Not all applicable entities will be required to\nprovide data from every equipment category outlined in this Appendix. Each TO or Lead MP\nwill be required to provide relevant modeling data for the equipment it is responsible for. As an\nexample, a Lead MP representing a GO that owns only a generator step up transformer with a\nhigh side, wye-grounded winding with terminal voltage greater than 200 kV for interconnecting\na particular generation plant (but does not own a transmission line or substation) will be required\nto provide modeling data only for the generator step up transformer.\n\nAdditional technical details for the modeling data requirements in this Appendix can be found in:\n\n     - NERC’s “Application Guide Computing Geomagnetically-Induced Current in the\n_Bulk-Power System,” which is available at:_\n[http://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Geomagnetic%20Disturbance%20Task%20Force%2](http://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Geomagnetic%20Disturbance%20Task%20Force%20GMDTF%202013/GIC%20Application%20Guide%202013_approved.pdf)\n[0GMDTF%202013/GIC%20Application%20Guide%202013_approved.pdf](http://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Geomagnetic%20Disturbance%20Task%20Force%20GMDTF%202013/GIC%20Application%20Guide%202013_approved.pdf)\n\n     - NPCC “Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) Modeling Data Collection White\n_Paper,” which is available at:_\n[https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/library/publications/other/npcc-gic-data-](https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/library/publications/other/npcc-gic-data-collection-white-paper.pdf)\n[collection-white-paper.pdf](https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/library/publications/other/npcc-gic-data-collection-white-paper.pdf)\n\nModeling data for all relevant equipment owned by the same entity must be submitted in a single\nstandardized Excel file. Appendix 2 includes a link to the standardized Excel file that specifies\nall of the GIC modeling data parameters needed to perform a GMD assessment.\n\nBelow are descriptions of some key parameters required for creating the GMD models. Note that\nsome Lead MPs may not have access to certain data, such as PSS®E bus numbers and ID data\npoints for a particular facility. In those cases, the Lead MP will work directly with the ISO to\ncoordinate the exchange of such modeling data.\n\n**Substation and Bus Data**\n\nThe substation data necessary to complete the analysis includes:\n\na. Substation Number (I): if the substation has multiple bus numbers in the PSS®E\npower flow base case, then the lowest bus number of the highest voltage level in the\nbase case must be used. For example, the Orrington substation comprises multiple\nvoltage levels. For the Orrington substation, the lowest 345 kV bus number used in\nthe PSS®E power flow base cases would be used as the Orrington substation number.\n\nb. List of Buses: a correlation between buses in the PSS®E power flow base case and\ntheir corresponding substation is needed to perform GMD studies. For each\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nSupport Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis\n\nsubstation, each applicable entity should provide a list PSS®E power flow bus\nnumbers that comprise the substation. Buses connected via zero impedance lines,\ntwo-winding, or three-winding transformers are considered by the GIC analysis to be\npart of the same substation.\n\nc. Substation Name (NAME): the name may be up to twelve characters, and the actual\nsubstation name, e.g. ORRINGTON, should be used.\n\nd. Substation Geographic Latitude and Longitude in Degrees (LATITUDE,\nLONGITUDE): this data is used to calculate the length of branches that connect\nbetween substations, and the resulting applied GMD voltage. Such coordinate data\nmust be cross-checked with the corresponding coordinate data in the NX-9\napplication, and any needed corrections must be submitted to the ISO by the\napplicable entity (i.e. TO or a Lead MP for a GO) using the NX-9 application.\n\ne. Substation Grounding DC Resistance in Ohms (RG): this data is needed to calculate\nthe geomagnetically induced current flowing from the various elements connected to\na substation into the substation’s ground. The grounding resistance of the substation\ncan be obtained by direct measurement.\n\nInformation for border buses should be included. Border buses are the artificial buses\nused in the PSS®E power flow cases to identify the borders of a transmission line owned\nby different entities. Border buses connected to substation buses through zero impedance\nbranches will assume the coordinates of the substation. Other border buses will be\nrepresented by artificial substations to assign them coordinates. Border buses shall have a\nsubstation grounding DC resistance value of 99.0 Ω to represent them as ungrounded\nsubstations. Use the same naming convention that the border buses currently used in the\nPSS®E power flow base case.\n\nInformation on taps or switching stations shall also be included. A bus with no grounded\nequipment and that is not connected to a substation via zero impedance line(s) is\nconsidered a tap or switching station. Taps or switching stations shall have a substation\ngrounding DC resistance value of 99.0 Ω to represent them as ungrounded substations.\n\n**Transformer Data**\n\nThe complete modeling of transformers requires a series of data that is not found in the\ndata used in power flow studies. The most common place to find this information is the\nmanufacturer’s transformer test report. Refer to NERC’s “Application Guide Computing\n_Geomagnetically-Induced Current in the Bulk-Power System” for additional technical_\nexplanation of the DC model of transformers and the individual data points required. Key\nparameters for transformer GMD models include:\n\na. DC Resistance of Winding 1, 2, and 3 (for 3 Winding Transformers) (WRI, WRJ,\nWRK): these parameters are specified at nominal tap, in Ohms/Phase at 75 °C.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nSupport Geomagnetic Disturbance Analysis\n\nb. Grounding DC Resistance of Winding 1, 2, and 3 (for 3 Winding Transformers) in\nOhms (GRDWRI, GRDWRJ, GRDWRK).\n\nc. Presence of GIC Blocking Device in Neutral of Winding 1, 2 or 3(GICBDI, GICBDJ,\nGICBDK): this parameter is used to specify if a GIC blocking device is present in the\nneutral windings of a transformer.\n\nd. Vector Group (VECGRP): this parameter is used to specify the transformer winding\ngrounding connections and phase angles.\n\ne. Number of Cores (CORE): this parameter is used to specify the number of cores in a\ntransformer.\n\nf. KFACTOR: this factor is used to calculate transformer reactive power loss from GIC\nflowing through its winding (MVAR/AMP).\n\ng. Transformer Model (TMODEL): this identifier is used to define the configuration of a\ntransformer (e.g. two-winding/three-winding/auto transformer or a T model in DC\nnetwork).\n\nNote: Explicit three-winding transformer models must be provided for three winding\ntransformers.

It is unacceptable to use default parameters.|||\n\n|Requirement|Description|Y/N|Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Have pertinent control or hardware options accessible to the user (e.g. adjustable protection thresholds, real power recovery ramp rates frequency or voltage droop settings, voltage control response time).Diagnostic flags (e.g. flags to show control mode changes or which protection has been activated) should be accessible to facilitate analysis and should clearly identify why a model trips during simulations.|||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Requirement|Description|Y/N|Provide details if requirement not met or not applicable|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2|Be capable of accurately running for a time step of 10 μs or higher and not be restricted to operating at a single time step but within a range (eg. 10μs - 20 μs).Models requiring a smaller time step may mean that the control implementation has not used the interpolation features of PSCAD12 or is using inappropriate interfacing between the model and the larger network. Smaller time step will be considered on a case-by-case basis.|||\n|3|Be capable of initializing itself. Models shall initialize and ramp to full output without external input from simulation engineers. Any slower control functions which are included (such as switched shunt controllers or power plant controllers) must also accept initial condition variables if required13.|||\n|4|Accept external reference values. This includes real and reactive power reference values (for Q control modes), or voltage reference values (for V control modes) and utilize a single parameter for adjusting real power, and separately, a single parameter for adjusting voltage setpoints. Model must accept these reference variables for initialization, and be capable of changing these reference variables mid-simulation, i.e. dynamic signal references.|||\n|5|Allow protection models to be disabled. Many studies result in inadvertent tripping of converter equipment, and the ability to disable protection functions temporarily provides study engineers with valuable system diagnostic information.|||\n|6|Allow the active power capacity of the model to be scaled. This is distinct from a dispatchable power order and is used for modeling different plant capacities (e.g. if a portion of the plant is offline).|||\n|7|Allow the plant to be dispatched at any output within its operating range. If a minimum output is required, sufficient technical justification shall be provided. This is distinct from scaling a plant from one unit to more than one, and is used for testing plant behavior at various operating points.|||\n\n\n12 If power transistor switching frequency prevents accurate switching representation at 10 μs using interpolation, an average source approximation may be used. See Section A, Requirement 2 for more details.\n\n13 Note that during the first few seconds of simulation (eg. 0-2 seconds), the system voltage and corresponding terminal conditions may deviate from nominal values due to other system devices initializing, and the model must be able to tolerate these\n\ndeviations or provide a variable initialization time.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### C.

Introduction**\n\n**1.1 Section I.3.9 Requirement**\n\nUnder Section I.3.9 of the Tariff, each Market Participant or Transmission Owner must submit\nplans for additions to or changes in facilities that might “have a significant effect on the stability,\nreliability or operating characteristics of the Transmission Owner’s transmission system, the\ntransmission facilities of another Transmission Owner or the system of a Market Participant.”\nSection 1 of ISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-1, “Procedure for Review of Market\nParticipant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans”, describes the process and contains the\nprocedures to be followed in complying with the stated requirement. Section 1 also summarizes\nthe information recommended or required for a formal submittal of a Proposed Plan Application.\nPP5-1 also contains the Proposed Plan Application forms and description of the information\nrequired.\n\nThis PP5-3 guideline is intended to be an aid to both the Market Participant or Transmission Owner\nfiling a Proposed Plan Application and the committees who evaluate the effects of proposed\nadditions or changes. To allow opportunity for an orderly and timely review, applicants are\nstrongly recommended to supply supporting information in accordance with these guidelines with\nlead times appropriate for anticipated “Level of Analysis Required” (see PP5-3, Section 3.1.2).\nThe Market Participant or Transmission Owner must confirm with the ISO that information is\ncomplete prior to formal submittal of its Proposed Plan Application.\n\n**1.2 Using the Guidelines**\n\nThese guidelines are structured according to the facility for which an application is required and\nby concerns specific to that type of facility. Each section outlines the information to be provided\nand the measures used to evaluate the information in determining if the proposed facilities will or\nwill not have a \"significant adverse effect\" on the stability, reliability or operating characteristics\nof the electric power system.\n\nGenerating unit operating characteristics and other power supply related concerns are addressed\nin Section 2.0 Generating Units – Power Supply Concerns. Since a generating unit can affect\nthe performance of the integrated generation/transmission bulk power system, the guidelines of\nSection 3.0 also apply for generation Proposed Plan Applications.\n\nTransmission facility additions and changes refer to transmission lines and substation equipment\nfor which Proposed Plan Applications are required, including HVDC terminals and static VAR\ncompensators and are addressed in Section 3.0 Generating Units and Transmission Facilities –\n**Bulk Power System Performance.**\n\nGuidelines for protection and control system changes requiring approval of Proposed Plan\nApplications, including Special Protection Systems (SPSs) and Dynamic Control Systems, are\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\ndiscussed in Section 4.0 Protection Systems and Dynamic Control Systems. A list of defined\nterms utilized in this guide is included in Section 5.0 Definitions.\n\n**2.0 Generating Units - Power Supply Concerns**\n\nMarket Participants or Transmission Owners filing a Proposed Plan Application shall provide all\ninformation requested on the generation Proposed Plan Application, which is Attachment 1 to PP5-1.\nOnly complete applications will be accepted for review. New units are required to meet specific\ncriteria, listed below. Non-compliance with the criteria below will be grounds for rejecting the\nProposed Plan Application. A Proposed Plan Application should be rejected if a significant adverse\nimpact on the existing electric system is identified. The Proposed Plan Application will not be\naccepted until it is modified to eliminate the identified negative impact.\n\na. Both physical and contractual operating characteristics of all units must be reported.\nDuring emergency conditions, including the entire spectrum of load levels from peak to\nlight load, the most restrictive operating limitations, either physical or contractual will be\nused to determine the unit’s operation. Identify the normal and emergency operating\ncharacteristics of the unit from a physical unit characteristic perspective. Also, identify\nthe contractual operating characteristics, if different. Particular attention should be given\nto operating limits (high and low), minimum shut down times, minimum run times, and\nstart up times.\n\nIf unable to complete the NX-12 form, provide a detailed description of the amount of\ndispatch control the ISO will have in determining the operation and/or output of the unit.\nIndicate when, and how frequently the unit can be reduced to its low limit and/or shut\ndown during emergency conditions.\n\nProvide information on any constraints due to waste to energy conversion,\nprimary/secondary steam requirements, or any other physical constraints that determine\noperating flexibility.\n\nb. If a new unit is 10 MW or larger, it must be equipped with a functioning turbine governor.\n\nc. The settings for underfrequency relays must comply with NPCC guidelines and be\napproved by the host utility.\n\n**3.0 Generating Units and Transmission Facilities - Bulk Power System Performance**\n\n**3.1 Classification and Reporting of Analyses**\n\nThis section provides guidance on the bulk power system performance analyses required to support\na generation or transmission Proposed Plan Application. The type of change/addition and its\npotential effects on the interconnected system determines the depth of analysis expected in support\nof a particular Proposed Plan Application. It defines the levels of analysis expected over the range\nof Proposed Plan Applications and guides the applicant to that level best suited to the particular\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\napplication at hand. General guidance on performance measures and expectations is provided in\nSubsection 2.0. Subsections 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 provide specific details on expected studies.\n\n3.1.1 Areas of investigation\n\nA Proposed Plan Application analysis is expected to demonstrate the impact of the\nchange/addition on system performance in two transmission-related areas: area\ntransmission requirements and transmission transfer capabilities. As applicable, the\nanalysis should demonstrate the impact on the power supply concerns detailed in Section\n2.0 above.\n\nImpact on area transmission requirements is investigated by showing that the resultant\nsystem (after the change/addition) has sufficient transmission capacity to serve the area\nloads under the conditions noted below and in Planning Procedure 3 “Reliability Standards\nfor the New England Area Pool Transmission Facilities” (the “Reliability Standards”).\nImpact on inter-Area and intra-Area transmission transfer capability should be\ndemonstrated for the conditions noted below.\n\n3.1.2 Level of analysis required\n\nFour levels of analysis are identified for supporting a particular Proposed Plan Application.\nAdditional analyses may be requested by the Principal Committees or the ISO. Affected\nEntities, [1] in consultation with the ISO, may request analysis necessary to assess the impact\non their respective systems. The levels are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 0: A Proposed Plan Application is not required\n\nLevel I: A Proposed Plan Application is required for information only; reporting of\nstudy results or analysis is not required\n\nLevel II: As appropriate, analyses based on testing such as load flow, short circuit,\ntransient network analysis (TNA), etc. should address one or both of the\nfollowing:\n                 - Area Transmission Steady State Assessment (Reference:\nReliability Standards)\n\n                 - Transfer Capability Assessment (Reference: Transmission Planning\nTechnical Guide Appendix I: Transfer Capability Methodology)\n\nDetailed descriptions will be found in Section 3.3 Steady State Analysis and\nSection 3.4 Other Testing.\n\nLevel III: As appropriate, the analyses should include Level II testing and should address\none or more of the following:\n\n                   - Area Transmission Stability Assessment (Reference: Reliability\nStandards)\n\n1 See ISO New England Planning Procedures No. 5-0, “Procedure for Reporting Notice of Intent to Construct or Change\nFacilities in Accordance with Section I.3.9 of the ISO New England Tariff (Proposed Plan Application Procedure)\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n                   - Dynamic Transfer Capability Assessment (Reference: Transmission\nPlanning Technical Guide Appendix I: Transfer Capability methodology)\n\nDetailed descriptions will be found in Section 3.3 Steady State Analysis\nSection 3.4 Other Testing, and Section 3.5 Stability Analysis.\n\nSection 2.0, Additions or Changes Requiring Proposed Plan Applications, of PP5-1 defines\nitems that may require Proposed Plan Applications. This list has been expanded and\naugmented with a table to guide the Proposed Plan applicant to the appropriate minimum level\nof analysis consistent with the proposed addition or change. [2] The table titled Level of Analysis\nGuideline is in Attachment 1.\n\nThe Proposed Plan applicant first determines the facility and the action applied to the facility\ne.g. add, replace, or remove to name a few. Next through a list of questions and thresholds,\nthe appropriate level of analysis is determined.\n\nIt should be noted that the Level of Analysis Guideline table is a guide and ISO-NE may\nrequire a higher level of analysis than the level of analysis determined from the guideline table.\n\nFor the more complex Level II analyses and those of Level III, a single scope of work should\nbe submitted for review by the ISO. This scope should include the items listed in Sections\n3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 below: a brief description of the facility changes and a description of the\nsystem representation to be used in the study, including all major assumptions regarding test\nconditions for load flow, dynamics and/or other studies. Periodic status reports to the ISO,\nsummarizing testing and results to date, will assist in completing these complex analyses in a\ntimely manner.\n\nBased on past analyses, the expected amount of time generally needed from initial submission\nof study work to completion of review (and formal submittal of application) is as follows:\n\nLevel I: No study work submitted\nLevel II: 1 to 4 months, depending on complexity\nLevel III: 3 to 12 months, depending on complexity\n\n3.1.3 Reporting\n\nThis section contains guidelines for the content of reports submitted in support of Proposed\nPlan Applications. Materials submitted with a Proposed Plan Application must be adequate to\nsupport the proposal. It is recognized that it may be necessary to conduct a Proposed Plan\nstudy using preliminary data describing transmission line and machine parameters. Using\nsuch data implies an obligation to provide more specific information at a later time.\n\n3.1.3.1 Description of Proposed Facility(ies)\n\n2 NERC Standard FAC-002-4, Facility Interconnection Studies, introduces a new term, Qualified Change, which is defined\nby ISO-NE as an interconnection of new generation, transmission, or electricity end-user facilities or change of an existing\ninterconnection of generation, transmission, or electricity end-user facilities that requires Level II or Level III analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDescribe the proposed facilities including how the modified system will be operated\nand a brief reason for the proposal.\n\nProvide a map showing geographical location, a one-line diagram of the affected\nportion of the power system, and a switching diagram including the proposed facility\nand nearby facilities.\n\n3.1.3.2 Description of System Representation Used in Studies\n\nFor Level II and III analyses, as appropriate, provide:\n\n3.1.3.2.1 Load flow Studies - Year, season, load level, base interchanges, list of future\nfacilities represented, source of representation and pertinent test assumptions\nas described in Section 3.1.1, Conditions to be Tested (below).\n\n3.1.3.2.2 Dynamics Studies - Source of machine data and other dynamics modeling and\ndata, load model, special protection systems and other pertinent assumptions\nas described in Section 3.5.1, Conditions to be Tested (below).\n\n3.1.3.2.3 Other Testing (transient network analysis, short circuit analysis, etc.) - Source\nof representation, including machine data and network equivalents. Other\npertinent test assumptions should be noted where they differ from those\ndescribed above for load flow studies.\n\n3.1.3.2.4 Analysis and Reporting of Results\nFor Level II and III analyses, as appropriate, provide a description of the\nbaseline performance without the modification, a summary of the tests\nconducted with the modification and the resulting system performance in\nterms of its conformance to the Reliability Standards. Information of interest\nis discussed below in Section 3.3.1.2, 3.3.1.3 and 3.3.1.4 and Section 3.3.2 for\nSteady State Analyses, Section 3.5.1.2, 3.5.1.3 and 3.5.1.4 and Section 3.5.2\nfor Stability Analyses and Section 3.4.0 for Other Testing. This information\nshould be sufficient to clearly demonstrate system performance without\nincluding exhaustive details of all results.\n\n3.1.3.2.5 Conclusions\nPresent arguments for approval of application consistent with Section 3.3.3\nfor steady state analyses, Section 3.5.3 for stability analyses and Section 3.4\nfor other testing.\n\n**3.2 Evaluation**\n\nThe Reliability Committee and the ISO will evaluate a number of aspects of the studies submitted\nin support of a Proposed Plan Application. As deemed appropriate by the ISO in accordance with\napplicable codes of conduct and confidentiality requirements, including the “ISO New England\nInformation Policy” in Attachment D of the Tariff, the ISO will consult with Affected Entities\nregarding testing and aspects of the proposed plan that are specific to their respective systems.\nThe evaluation of the acceptability of the proposed changes or additions begins with review of the\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nadequacy and acceptability of testing and test results. The results of tests performed and submitted\nin support of proposed additions or changes in facilities should clearly demonstrate compliance\nwith the desired level of reliability as outlined in the Reliability Standards. The level of\nperformance expected is intended to: 1) assure the reliability of the overall interconnected system\nand minimize the risk of widespread cascading outages due to overloads, instability or voltage\ncollapse; and 2) demonstrate that the Nuclear Plant Interface Requirements (NPIRs) as\ndocumented in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission\nOperations, Attachments C and D, are met. The Reliability Standards establish a minimum design\ncriteria by outlining representative contingency tests and assessment.\n\nDemonstration of acceptable system performance under the enumerated conditions and\nassumptions should be considered the minimum level of compliance. Additional testing,\nevaluations or adjustments to assumptions may be deemed necessary to either assure the adequacy\nof system performance or to distinguish a sensitivity to one particular condition from a more\ngeneral system weakness. The final conclusions and recommendations should be based on the\ninformed engineering judgment of the Reliability Committee with the objective of assuring that\nproposed changes or additions in facilities will not have a significant adverse impact on the\nstability, reliability or operating characteristics of the interconnected bulk power system.\n\nGenerally, if results of testing indicate that the system is not sufficient to accommodate the\nproposed changes or additions in facilities, system reinforcements or other mitigating measures\nwill be required. These reinforcements or mitigating measures should fully alleviate all adverse\nimpacts which were introduced by the proposed change or addition.\n\nOccasionally, testing may identify weaknesses in the system prior to introduction of the proposed\nchange or addition in facilities. The degree to which the proposed change or addition further\ndegrades the stability, reliability or operating characteristics of the system will be of primary\nconcern. Where no significant impact is identified, it may be possible to conclude that the\nproposed change or addition does not degrade system reliability. This judgment should take into\naccount the frequency, duration, magnitude and consequences of any conditions where reliability\nviolations occur both prior to and subsequent to the proposed changes or additions.\n\n**3.3 Steady State Analysis**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting the Proposed\nPlan Application to identify the most severe conditions that can reasonably be expected to exist.\nIt must be demonstrated that under such conditions, the proposed additions or changes will not\nhave any significant adverse impact upon the reliability or operating characteristics of the bulk\npower system; otherwise, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner must propose system\nmodifications, protection systems and/or operating restrictions on the proposed addition which\nwill eliminate such adverse impact. Studies demonstrating steady state performance must then\nsimulate normal conditions as well as conditions that stress the system beyond \"typical\"\ncombinations of load level, generation dispatch and power transfers. Since it is necessary for\nsupporting studies to reflect conditions expected to exist at the time of a future system\nmodification, such conditions might include other future facilities with or without Proposed Plan\napproval that may be installed by about the same point in the future. Upon request, the ISO will\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nassist the Market Participant or Transmission Owner in identifying reasonably stressed conditions\nfor testing.\n\n3.3.1 Conditions to be Tested\n\n3.3.1.1 Assumptions\n\na. Selection of Year or Year(s) to Model - The initial year chosen for study is\nnormally that of the anticipated system modification. However, the following\nmatters may need to be considered:\n\n                   - other facilities coming on-line in the same time period; and\n\n                   - other influences in the area, such as changes in contracts.\n\nThe Reliability Committee and the ISO will provide guidance in selecting the year(s)\nand related conditions to be studied.\n\nb. Source of Base Case - The base case should have its origin from the ISO’s library\nof cases, with changes or modifications as necessary.\n\nc. Other Proposed Facilities - Inclusion of planned or proposed facilities in a study\nis subject to the status of other Proposed Plan Applications, and the System Impact\nStudy queue. Consequently each proposed or planned facility must be\nindividually identified in the scope of the study with the aid of the ISO prior to the\nstart of the study. Having identified the planned or proposed facilities to include\nin the study, the study can be done with either or both of the following approaches:\n1) the facility assumed installed in the base condition with tests determining the\nsensitivity of system response without the facility, or 2) as not installed in the base\ncondition, but with sensitivity tests conducted with the facility included. The\nMarket Participant or Transmission Owner conducting the analysis should judge\nwhich approach is appropriate for the evaluation.\n\nd. Modeling Devices - Models for devices of particular concern, such as HVdc\nterminals, are available from the ISO. It is the responsibility of the Proposed Plan\napplicant to properly represent these devices where appropriate.\n\ne. Load Level - Disturbances should be studied at peak load levels since they usually\npromote more pronounced thermal and voltage response within the New England\nControl Area than at other load levels. However, other load levels may be of\ninterest in a particular analysis. This should be determined and, as appropriate,\nadditional studies should be conducted.\n\nf. Generation Dispatch - Testing should not be restricted to only typical dispatch;\nrather the dispatch(es) should be developed to reasonably test the proposed\nadditions or changes. For example, for an export condition within the study area,\nthe dispatch should model the maximum number of fully loaded generators\nexpected to be in-service unless constrained by the transfer limits of an interface.\nFor an import condition, unit outages simulated within the study area should\nreflect must-run, spinning reserve and minimum reactive support requirements of\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nsystem operation. All dispatches are subject to review by the ISO. The ISO will\nconsult with Affected Entities regarding dispatches that are relevant to potential\nproposed plan impact on their respective systems.\n\ng. Modeling of Transfer Conditions - Generally, intra-Area transfers will be\nsimulated at or near their established limits (in the direction to produce \"worst\ncases\" results) and sensitivities to inter-Area transfers will be determined as\nappropriate. The rationale for maintaining these transfer levels before and after\nthe addition of the proposed facility should be discussed. The ISO has developed\nand maintains a list of intra-Area interfaces used in operations.\n\n3.3.1.2 Baseline Performance\n\nUsing the supplied and/or modified library case, testing should be conducted to\ndetermine pre-addition system performance. This testing will:\n\n           - validate the representation of the case used; and\n\n           - establish a baseline of performance from which the direct impact of the proposed\nmodification can be demonstrated.\n\n3.3.1.3 Contingency Selection\n\nThe applicant should develop a specific list of contingencies that comply with each\nsection of the Reliability Standards which applies, including extreme contingencies.\nAdditional contingency tests, consistent with those standards may be requested by\nISO.\n\n3.3.1.4 Tests With A Line Out Of Service\n\nApplications for major changes in transmission or generation facilities should\ninclude tests of system performance with selected lines out of service assuming that\nthe area resources and power flows are adjusted between outages. These tests should\nidentify and evaluate potential constraints to future system operation.\n\n3.3.2 Results Reporting\n\nThe applicant should provide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate\nsystem performance under both normal and stressed conditions. This would include:\n\n3.3.2.1 Summary of load flow tests conducted and their results, with and without the\nproposed modifications, showing at a minimum the following information:\n\n           - Load level, generation dispatch and pertinent major interface loadings (both interArea and intra-Area);\n\n          - Contingencies tested;\n\n           - A single summary of lines loaded to 95% or more of their applicable rating;\n\n           - Bus voltages outside a range of .95 to 1.05 p.u.;\n\n           - Interactions with existing special protection systems; and\n\n         - Observed results and related comments, including impact on NPIRs, as\nappropriate.\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3.3.2.2 Summary of results from any other pertinent testing performed such as the analyses\ndescribed in Section 3.4, Other Testing.\n\n3.3.2.3 One line diagrams showing flows and voltages with and without the proposed\nchanges or additions for the following conditions:\n\n           - Normal generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service;\n\n           - Stressed generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service; and\n\n          - All significant contingency conditions for both normal and stressed generation\ndispatch cases.\n\n3.3.2.4 Clear, concise narrative interpreting the above results and leading to the conclusion\nthat installation of the subject facility(ies) will have no significant adverse effect on\nthe reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.\nAlso, any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with the\nproposed facility should be fully documented and explained.\n\n3.3.3 Steady State Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of steady state analyses submitted in support of Proposed Plan Applications\nwill be based on the considerations and expectations described in Section 3.2, Evaluation.\nAdditionally, the two aspects noted below will be of primary concern to the Reliability\nCommittee and the ISO during their review.\n\n3.3.3.1 Was the analysis conducted according to generally accepted practice?\n\n           - Were assumptions and test conditions as outlined in Section 3.3.1?\n\n           - Were tools and procedures applied properly and were they sufficient to provide a\ncomplete analysis?\n\n3.3.3.2 Do results of the analysis support the conclusion that the change(s) will: 1) result in\nno significant adverse effect on the reliability of the bulk power system; and 2) meet\nthe NPIRs? If the analyses indicated any problem areas, how were they resolved?\n\nIn particular, the ISO will review each analysis, and consult with Affected Entities as\nnecessary, to ensure that all of the applicable conditions specified in the Reliability Standards\nare satisfied. The recommendation of the ISO to the Reliability Committee will be based on\nthe applicant having satisfied the applicable conditions required in the Reliability Standards.\n\n**3.4** **Other Testing**\n\nStudies demonstrating system performance may occasionally require other testing, in addition to\nthe load flow testing described in Section 3.3 above, to adequately assess the effects of proposed\nfacility changes or additions on the reliability and operating characteristics of the bulk power\nsystem. The need for this other testing, such as transient network analysis, short-circuit analysis,\nand/or reactive power and voltage (Q/V) analysis, depends on the specific project involved. These\nthree analyses, while dealing with dynamic phenomena, do not involve the detailed time\nsimulation of a stability analysis; rather, each is a single snapshot of the ability of the power system\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nto withstand events such as loss of components, short-circuits or unanticipated demand. It is the\nresponsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting the Proposed Plan\nApplication to consider the need for these tests when preparing the Proposed Plan supporting\nanalysis and include them as appropriate. The Reliability Committee or the ISO may request any\none or more of these other tests, or in the course of their review of the supporting analysis, may\nrequest other testing not described in this guideline. The ISO will consult, as necessary, with\nAffected Entities regarding the need for additional testing relevant to the potential impact of the\nproposed plan on their respective systems. Each Market Participant or Transmission Owner that\nis a Nuclear Plant Generator Operator is expected to have its Reliability Committee representative\nreview the reporting of analysis of a proposed plan and request any additional analysis to address\nmeeting any applicable NPIRs.\n\n3.4.1 Transient Network Analysis (TNA)\n\nTransient Network Analysis studies are typically performed as part of the detailed design\nengineering of a project where there may be concern for transient or temporary\novervoltages, voltage flicker, arrester capabilities or insulation coordination. Sudden\nchanges in circuit conditions, such as switching operations, lightning strikes, sudden loss\nof load or inrush currents (e.g., from a cable, capacitor bank or transformer energization or\nde-energization) can lead to this type of overvoltage, whose effects are usually confined to\nan area localized to the switching station. As such, those projects where this would be a\nconcern typically include a TNA study as part of the design process but do not usually\ninclude the TNA results as part of the Proposed Plan study.\n\nIn those situations where a neighboring Affected Entity is close enough to be potentially\naffected (typically no more than two busses away from the switching location), the\napplicant and the Affected Entity should engage in a joint review of the base case models\nto be used in the TNA study. Then, in the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should\nprovide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate system performance\nunder both normal and stressed conditions. This would normally include a summary of\nall TNA tests conducted and their results, generally in the form of peak overvoltages or\npercent voltage change at selected busses and a clear, concise narrative interpreting these\nresults and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have\nno significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section\nI.3.9 of the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated\nwith the proposed change or addition should be fully documented and explained.\n\n3.4.2 Short-Circuit Analysis\n\nProjects such as the addition of a generator or a transmission element can have a significant\nimpact on the short-circuit duty at substations in the vicinity of the proposed facilities. For\nthose projects where this would be a concern, the applicant should include an analysis of\nthe incremental effects of the project on short-circuit interrupting duty in the vicinity of\nthe proposed change or addition. In those situations where a neighboring Affected Entity\nis close enough to be significantly affected, the applicant and the other Affected Entity(ies)\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nshould engage in a joint review of the capabilities of the equipment in the area prior to\nsubmission of the Proposed Plan analysis.\n\nIn the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should provide sufficient details and information\nto clearly demonstrate system performance with respect to short-circuits. This would\nnormally include a summary of the short-circuit tests conducted and their results, generally\nin the form of duty at selected busses, and a clear, concise narrative interpreting these\nresults and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject facility(ies) will have\nno significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9\nof the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with\nthe proposed change or addition should be fully documented and explained.\n\n3.4.3 Q/V Analysis\n\nVoltage and reactive power performance of the bulk power system varies according to the\nload, transmission and generation in each area. It cannot be predicted system-wide by a\nsingle type of facility change or addition. Rather, the impact on the bulk system of a\nparticular change or addition is evidenced by a high sensitivity of voltage at key busses in\nthe system to changes in load, circuit conditions, or reactive compensation. For those\nprojects where this would be a concern, the applicant should include an analysis of the\neffects of the proposed change or addition on the reactive power and voltage performance\nof the bulk power system.\n\nIn the Proposed Plan study, the applicant should provide sufficient details and information\nto clearly demonstrate reactive power support and voltage performance under both normal\nand stressed conditions. This would normally include a summary of all tests conducted\nand their results, generally in the form of Q/V (or P/V) curves or another measure of\nreactive power and voltage margin in the affected area and a clear, concise narrative\ninterpreting these results and leading to the conclusion that installation of the subject\nfacility(ies) will have no significant effect on the reliability of the bulk power system as\nspecified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff. Any actions required to mitigate adverse system\nbehavior associated with the proposed change or addition should be fully documented and\nexplained.\n\n**3.5 Stability Analysis**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting a Proposed\nPlan Application to identify the most severe conditions that can reasonably be expected to exist.\nIt must be demonstrated that under such conditions, the proposed additions or changes will not\nhave any significant adverse impact upon the stability, reliability or operating characteristics of\nthe bulk power system; otherwise, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner must propose\nsystem modifications, protection systems and/or operating restrictions which will eliminate such\nadverse impact. Studies demonstrating dynamic performance must then simulate conditions that\nstress the system beyond \"typical\" combinations of load level, generation dispatch and power\ntransfers. Further, while the dynamic response of an individual proposed generating unit is of\ninterest, the response of the bulk power system is of primary importance. Since it is necessary for\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nsupporting studies to reflect conditions expected to exist at the time of a future system\nmodification, such conditions might include other future facilities with or without Proposed Plan\napproval that may be installed by about the same point in the future. Upon request, the ISO will\nassist the Market Participant or Transmission Owner in identifying reasonably stressed conditions\nfor testing.\n\n3.5.1 Conditions to be Tested\n\n3.5.1.1 Assumptions\n\na. Selection of Year(s) to Model - The initial year chosen for study is normally that\nof the anticipated system modification. However, the following matters may need\nto be considered:\n\n            - other facilities coming on-line in the same time period; and\n\n            - other influences in the area, such as changes in contracts.\n\nThe Reliability Committee and the ISO will provide guidance in selecting the year\nand related conditions to be studied.\n\nb. Source of Base Case(s) - The base case(s) should have its origin from the ISO’s\nlibrary of cases, with changes or modifications as necessary.\n\nc. Other Proposed Facilities - Inclusion of planned or proposed facilities in a study\nis subject to the status of other Proposed Plan Applications, and the System Impact\nStudy queue. Consequently each proposed or planned facility must be\nindividually identified in the scope of the study with the aid of the ISO prior to the\nstart of the study. Having identified the planned or proposed facilities to include\nin the study, the study can be done with either or both of the following approaches:\n1) the facility assumed installed in the base condition with tests determining the\nsensitivity of system response without the facility, or 2) the facility not installed\nin the base condition, but with sensitivity tests conducted with the facility\nincluded. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner conducting the analysis\nshould judge which approach is appropriate for the evaluation.\n\nd. Modeling Devices - Models for devices of particular concern, such as HVdc\nterminals, are available from the ISO. It is the responsibility of the Proposed Plan\napplicant to properly represent these devices where appropriate.\n\ne. Load Level - Disturbances should be studied at light load levels since they usually\npromote more pronounced dynamic response within the New England Control\nArea than at other load levels. However, other load levels may be of interest in a\nparticular analysis. This should be determined and, as appropriate, additional\nstudies should be conducted.\n\nf. Generation Dispatch - Testing should not be restricted to only typical dispatch;\nrather the dispatch(es) should be developed to test the proposed modification under\nstressed conditions. For example, an export condition would be tested by\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nmodeling the maximum number of fully loaded generators expected to be inservice in the exporting area unless constrained by the transfer limits of an\ninterface. This will demonstrate if groups of machines in such areas could\naccelerate and lose synchronism with the bulk power system. At the same time, a\n\"reasonable\" number of units should be dispatched within the importing areas.\nThese units need not be fully dispatched but they should reflect must-run, spinning\nreserve and minimum reactive support requirements of system operation. All\ndispatches are subject to review by the ISO. The ISO will consult with Affected\nEntities regarding dispatches that are relevant to potential proposed plan impact\non their respective systems.\n\ng. Modeling of Transfer Conditions - Transfer levels should be selected to produce\naccentuated dynamic response. Generally, intra-Area transfers will be simulated\nat or near their established limits (in the direction to produce \"worst cases\" results)\nand sensitivities to inter-Area transfers will be determined as appropriate. The\nrationale for choosing particular interface loadings before and after a modification\ndue to a proposed facility should be discussed. The ISO has developed and\nmaintains a list of interfaces used in operations.\n\n3.5.1.2 Baseline Performance\n\nUsing the supplied and/or modified library case, testing should be conducted to\nvalidate the representation of the case and dynamics modeling used. If contingency\ntesting indicates a problem, pre-addition testing will be needed to establish a baseline\nof performance from which the direct impact of the proposed modification can be\ndemonstrated.\n\n3.5.1.3 Contingency Selection\n\nThe applicant should develop a specific list of contingencies that comply with each\nsection of the Reliability Standards which applies, including extreme contingencies.\nAdditional contingency tests, consistent with those standards may be requested by\nthe ISO. To assist in understanding the selection of contingencies, the applicant\nshould provide a general description of the relay systems at 115 kV stations and\nabove in the vicinity of the proposed change.\n\n3.5.1.4 Tests With A Line Out Of Service\n\nApplications for major changes in transmission or generation facilities should\ninclude tests of system performance with selected lines out of service assuming that\nthe area resources and power flows are adjusted between outages. These tests should\nidentify and evaluate potential constraints to future system operation.\n\n3.5.2 Results Reporting\n\nThe applicant should provide sufficient details and information to clearly demonstrate system\nperformance under both normal and stressed conditions. This would include:\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3.5.2.1 Summary of dynamic tests conducted and their results, with and without the proposed\nmodification, showing at a minimum the following information:\n\n           - Load level, generation dispatch and major interface loadings;\n\n          - Contingencies tested, with assumed sequence of events and associated times;\n\n           - Interactions with existing special protection systems; and\n\n          - Observed results and related comments as appropriate.\n\n3.5.2.2 One line diagrams showing at a minimum flows and voltages with and without the\nproposed modifications for the conditions tested, including:\n\n           - Normal generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service;\n\n           - Stressed generation dispatch conditions with all lines in service; and\n\n             - Conditions tested with lines out of service.\n\n3.5.2.3 Plots demonstrating that stability is maintained in the area of the modification, in\nother areas of New England and in neighboring systems. Enough information must\nbe provided to demonstrate no other dynamics problems are encountered, such as\nunacceptable voltage or frequency excursions, undamped oscillations, control\nsystem problems, etc.\n\n3.5.2.4 Clear, concise narrative interpreting the above results and leading to the conclusion\nthat installation of the subject facility(ies) will have no significant adverse effect on\nthe reliability of the bulk power system as specified in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff.\nAlso, any actions required to mitigate adverse system behavior associated with the\nproposed facility should be fully documented and explained.\n\n3.5.3 Stability Evaluations\n\nEvaluations of stability analyses submitted in support of Proposed Plan Applications will\nbe based on the considerations and expectations described in Section 3.2. Additionally,\nthe two aspects noted below will be of primary concern to the Reliability Committee and\nthe ISO during their review.\n\n3.5.3.1 Was analysis conducted according to generally accepted practice?\n\n          - Were assumptions and test conditions as outlined in Section 3.5.1?\n\n          - Were tools and procedures applied properly and were they sufficient to provide a\ncomplete analysis?\n\n3.5.3.2 Do results of analysis support conclusion that the change(s) will: 1) result in no\nsignificant adverse effect on the reliability of the bulk power system; and 2) meet the\nNPIRs? If the analyses indicated any problem areas, how were they resolved?\n\nThe ISO will review each analysis, and consult with Affected Entities, as necessary, to ensure\nthat all of the applicable conditions in the Reliability Standards are satisfied. The\nrecommendation of the ISO to the Reliability Committee will be based on the applicant having\nsatisfied the applicable conditions required in the Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**4.0 Protection Systems and Dynamic Control Systems**\n\nSections 2.6 and 3.3 of PP5-1 indicate the protection system additions/changes for which Proposed\nPlan Applications are required. These fall into two categories: fault clearing and special protection\nsystems (SPSs).\n\nProposed Plan Applications for additions/changes in protection systems designed for fault clearing\nshould include assurance that:\n\n     - the protection system is designed in accordance with the NPCC Bulk Power System Protection\nCriteria;\n\n     - the associated fault clearing time will not degrade system reliability performance; and\n\n     - the NPIRs will be met.\n\nA Level III analysis, as described in Section 3.0, may be needed to demonstrate the effects of increased\nfault clearing times.\n\nApplications for SPSs require analyses similar to that of a generation or transmission application and\nthe guidelines of Section 3.0 apply. In addition to compliance with the Reliability Standards and\nNPCC Bulk Power System Protection Criteria, the following factors will be considered in evaluating\nan application for an SPS:\n\n     - Is the SPS initiated by a normal contingency or an extreme contingency?\n\n     - How many events trigger the SPS? Are the triggers local or remote?\n\n     - What are the monitoring requirements?\n\n     - How selective are the triggers (i.e., monitor system parameters vs. breaker contact)?\n\n     - Is the response local or remote?\n\n     - How many inputs, decisions and actions are involved?\n\n     - What is potential for interaction with other SPSs?\n\n     - Is the SPS required to control dynamic, voltage or thermal response?\n\n     - What actions are taken (load rejection, generation rejection, opening of a transmission line)?\n\n     - What is the probability that the SPS will be required to operate?\n\n     - What are the implications of inadvertent operation or misoperation (local vs. widespread\neffects)?\n\n     - Operational considerations (operator's view of requirements and constraints).\n\n     - Anticipated life of the SPS - is it meant to be temporary or permanent?\n\n     - What operating options are available if planning assumptions do not materialize?\n\n     - What are modeling requirements; when will they be provided?\n\n     - Economic tradeoffs with other alternatives.\n\n     - Will the NPIRs be met?\n\nDynamic control systems such as voltage regulator/exciter systems, power system stabilizers and\ngovernors on generators can have a significant effect on the stability, reliability or operating\ncharacteristics of the bulk power system. Such dynamic control systems and their attendant effects\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nare to be included in the analyses conducted in support of new generator additions. Effects of changes\nin dynamic control systems should normally be determined in the course of design studies and a\nProposed Plan Application should be submitted if such a change could have a significant effect on the\nperformance of the bulk power system. In such cases, a stability analysis may be requested as outlined\nin Section 3.5.\n\n**5.0 Definitions**\n\nIf appropriate definitions were available from the Reliability Standards they are used in this section.\nThe source of the definition is shown in parenthesis. Following these existing definitions, additional\ncomments are included to assist the reader in interpreting them.\n\nFor those cases where no formal definition exists, the one used here is based on a review of existing\nISO New England and NPCC documents.\n\n5.1 Applicable Emergency Limit\n\nTransmission circuit loading limits have been established for use under both normal and\nemergency conditions. In general, normal ratings are used for \"All lines in\" conditions. Under\nemergency conditions, long term emergency ratings (LTE) may be used for up to one daily load\ncycle assuming no contingency would cause the loading to go above LTE. Short term emergency\nratings (STE) may be used following a system disturbance for up to fifteen minutes. The STE\nratings may only be used in situations where the component loading can be reduced below the\nLTE ratings within fifteen minutes by operator corrective action.\n\nIn actual system operations, under emergency conditions, drastic action limits (DAL) may be used\nwhere preplanned immediate post contingency actions can reduce loadings below LTE within five\nminutes. These DAL limits are only used as a last resort during actual system operations. They\nshould not be used in testing the system adequacy in the Proposed Plan Application studies.\n\nEmergency voltage limits have also been established for system operation under emergency\nconditions. These limits recognize that voltages should not drop below those voltages required\nfor acceptable system stability performance, acceptable operation of generating auxiliaries,\nacceptable operation of other electrical equipment, operation well above the knee of the voltage\ncurve, and for meeting the NPIRs. Also, the voltage should not rise above the maximum rating of\nelectrical equipment.\n\n5.2 Reasonably Stressed Conditions\n\nReasonably stressed conditions are those severe load and generation system conditions which have\na reasonable probability of actually occurring. Generally both import and export conditions should\nbe addressed. The purpose of testing these conditions is to identify potential weaknesses in the\nsystem and not to test the worst imaginable extreme.\n\n5.3 Operating Characteristics\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP5-3: Guidelines For Conducting And Evaluating\nProposed Plan Application Analyses\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe actual operation of the interconnected system requires that each component of the system\nmust be capable of operating in such a manner as not to adversely affect the system operation.\nAny additions to the system must be able to operate in such a manner so as not to degrade the\npresent operating flexibility of the system. Operating Characteristics include, but are not limited\nto: dispatchability, including constraints on economic dispatch, voltage control, flicker,\nharmonics, black start capability, environmental limitations, maintenance scheduling, TV and\nradio interference, audible noise, and under frequency load shedding.\n\n5.4 Significant Adverse Effect (Section I.3.9 of the Tariff)\n\nThe existing system is designed and operated to meet specific criteria as contained in the various\ndocuments referenced through this guideline. After the addition it must be demonstrated that there\nhas been no significant degradation in the level of system performance.\n\n5.5 Normal Dispatch Conditions\n\nNormal Dispatch Conditions refers to the economic dispatch of all New England Control Area\ngeneration with appropriate allowance for scheduled maintenance and forced outages. Applicable\nfirm contractual transfers, both purchases and sales, should be included.\n\n5.6 Remedial Action Schemes\n\nSee PP5-5 Requirements and Guidelines for Application of Remedial Action Schemes and\nAutomatic Control Schemes.\n\n**Document History[3]**\n\nRev. 0: Rec.: RTPC – 1/18/00; App.: PC – 2/4/00\n\nRev. 1: Rec.: RC – 11/14/00; App.: PC 12/1/00\n\nRev. 2: Eff.: 2/1/05\n\nRev. 3: Rec.

A Category C Project\nrefers to a Generating Facility classified as Category C pursuant to Schedule 11 of the\nOATT, as well as an Elective Transmission Upgrade.\n\nPursuant to Section II.46 of the OATT, an addition or modification to the New England\nTransmission System may be required to accommodate the interconnection of a new or\nmodification to a Generating Facility or an Elective Transmission Upgrade pursuant to\nSchedules 22, 23, and 25 of the OATT. The additions or modifications necessary to\naccommodate a Generating Facility are collectively defined as Generator Interconnection\nRelated Upgrades. The additions or modifications necessary to accommodate an Elective\nTransmission Upgrade are referred to as Elective Transmission Upgrade related upgrades.\nA Reliability Transmission Upgrade (Reliability Upgrade), Market Efficiency\nTransmission Upgrade (Economic Upgrade), or Public Policy Transmission Upgrade\n(Public Policy Upgrade) may be required or proposed pursuant to the Regional System\nPlan (RSP) in Attachment K of the OATT. The cost allocation treatment of these upgrades,\nmodification or additions to the transmission system in New England is governed by\nSchedules 11 and 12 of the OATT.\n\n1\nCapitalized terms used in this Procedure are intended to have the same meaning given to such terms in Sections I.2.2\nof the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (the Tariff).\n2 Section II of the Tariff contains the Open Access Transmission Tariff (the OATT).\n\nJune 27, 2023 3\n\nISO- NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPP 4-1 – Implementation of Cost Responsibility Determination for Schedule 11 Category C Project\nTransmission Upgrades in Circumstances of Multiple Needs\n\nFor a Category C Project under Schedule 11 of the OATT, if a Generator Interconnection\nRelated Upgrade is required in order to satisfy the Capacity Capability Interconnection\nStandard or the Network Capability Interconnection Standard (or its predecessor standard)\nthe Generator Owner shall be obligated to pay all of the cost of such upgrade, including all\nDirect Interconnection Transmission Costs and any applicable tax gross-up amounts, to the\nextent such costs would not have been incurred “but for” the interconnection; provided\nthat, if ISO determines that a particular Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade\nprovides benefits to the system as a whole as well as to particular parties, then the cost of\nsuch Upgrade shall be allocated in the same way as Reliability Transmission Upgrades.[3]\n\nBased on Schedule 11 of the OATT, interconnection costs assigned to Generator Owners,\nas well as Elective Transmission Owner Interconnection Customer (ETU IC), for Category\nC Projects may be affected by whether an upgrade needed for the interconnection of the\nGenerating Facility or the Elective Transmission Upgrade has already been included in the\nRSP or RSP Project List for reasons other than the Generating Facility or Elective\nTransmission Upgrade interconnection. For example, if an upgrade identified as required\nto accommodate the Generating Facility or Elective Transmission Upgrade interconnection\nis already in the RSP Project List as a Reliability Upgrade or Economic Upgrade, as\ndescribed more fully below, its costs (depending on the project status level of the upgrade\nlisted in RSP or RSP Project List) potentially may not be assigned to the Generator Owner\nor ETU IC even if the same upgrades would be required for the Generating Facility or ETU\ninterconnection.\n\n**2.** **Cost Responsibility for Category C Project’s Interconnection-Related Upgrades**\n\n**With Multiple Needs**\n\nIf the upgrade needed for the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard or the Network\nCapability Interconnection Standard (or its predecessor standard) in connection with a\nCategory C Project is the same, or is similar to and provides a similar system benefit (a\n\n3 A Reliability Transmission Upgrade has costs allocated as specified in Schedule 12 and Planning Procedure 4.\n\nJune 27, 2023 4\n\nISO- NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPP 4-1 – Implementation of Cost Responsibility Determination for Schedule 11 Category C Project\nTransmission Upgrades in Circumstances of Multiple Needs\n\n“Similar Upgrade”), in whole or part, as a Transmission Upgrade included in the RSP or\nRSP Project List for Reliability, Economic or Public Policy reasons with a “Planned” or\n“Proposed”[4] status before the Interconnection Agreement is finalized, the cost (or the\napplicable portion of the cost) of the Generator Interconnection Related Upgrade or\nElective Transmission Upgrade related upgrade will be paid for under Schedule 12 (see\nPlanning Procedure 4[5] for further information) of the OATT.\n\nAn upgrade does not qualify as a Similar Upgrade if it involves situations such as:\n(1) re-conductoring rather than changing reactive compensation equipment;\n(2) building a new substation rather than a new transmission circuit;\n(3) installing a new transformer rather than re-conductoring; or\n(4) any changes, including cancellation, of projects in the RSP or the RSP Project List\n\nresulting from a Generating Facility or Elective Transmission Upgrade’s\ninterconnection (that are not Similar Upgrades as described above).\n\n**Document History**\n\nRev. 0 Rec.: RC – 4/27/01; App.: PC – 5/9/01\nRev. 1 Eff.: 2/1/05\nRev. 2   REC: RC – 8/24/2017; PC- 9/15/2017; ISO-NE 9/26/2017\nRev. 3   REC: RC – 5/16/2023; PC- 6/27/2023; ISO-NE 6/27/2023 – updates to footnotes 4 and 5\n\n4 Attachment K of the OATT specifies four levels of classification for a Transmission Upgrade: Proposed, Planned,\nUnder Construction, and In Service\n5 [https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2020/02/pp_4_rev9.pdf](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2020/02/pp_4_rev9.pdf)\n\nJune 27, 2023 5\n\nISO- NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\n"},

**Introduction**\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to describe the scope of Interconnection Studies conducted pursuant to\nSchedule 22 (“Large Generator Interconnection Procedures” or “LGIP”), Schedule 23 (“Small Generator\nInterconnection Procedures” or “SGIP”) and Schedule 25 (“Elective Transmission Upgrade\nInterconnection Procedures” or “ETU IP”) of Section II of the ISO New England Transmission, Markets\nand Services Tariff (the “Tariff”). One objective of this document is to provide guidance which ensures\nthat the Network Capability Interconnection Standard (“NCIS”) is consistently applied in defining the\nscope and study assumptions for generator and ETU Interconnection Studies. While not all ETUs are\neligible for Network Import Interconnection Service (“NIIS”), all are interconnected in a manner that, at\na minimum, meets the requirements of the NCIS. A second objective of this document is also to provide\nguidance which ensures that the scope and study assumptions for preliminary nonbinding analyses for\ngenerators and certain External ETUs that are eligible to request interconnection under the Capacity\nCapability Interconnection Standard (“CCIS”) are consistently applied.\n\nStudies conducted in accordance with this procedure are also used to support applications made\npursuant to Section I.3.9 (“Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans”) of the Tariff, [1] including\nstudies of proposed distributed energy resources that are processed under state interconnection\nprocedures. [2]\n\nThis document (and the relevant documents referenced herein) describes the interconnection\nrequirements and procedures for coordinated studies of new or materially modified existing Generating\nFacility and ETU interconnections and their impacts on affected system(s) as required by NERC FAC-001,\nFacility Interconnection Requirements. Those responsible for the reliability of affected system(s) of new\nor materially modified existing interconnections are notified in accordance with the “coordination with\naffected systems” provisions of the interconnection procedures.\n\nThe studies conducted in accordance with this procedure also serve to meet the requirements of NERC\nFAC-002, “Facility Interconnection Studies”, to demonstrate that the proposed Generating Facility or\nETU has been comprehensively studied to identify any reliability impact of the new interconnection, or\nmaterially modified existing interconnection, on affected system(s). As described in this document,\nstudies shall include steady-state, short-circuit, dynamics and other studies, as necessary, to evaluate\nsystem performance under both normal and contingency conditions and to ensure that the proposed\nimplementation will not cause non-compliance with the applicable NERC Standards including TPL-001,\n“Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements”.\n\nStudies that follow the guidance provided by this document will typically be sufficient to comply with\nTariff requirements; however, that does not preclude the possibility that some situations may require\nadditional analyses.\n\n1 Additional information on the relevant planning procedures is found in Planning Procedures PP5-1 and PP5-3.\n2 Studies of proposed distributed energy resources (DER) are sometimes referred to as “affected system operator”\nstudies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**1.1** **Interconnection Standards**\n\nNCIS describes the minimum requirements to interconnect a proposed new Generating Facility in the\nNew England Control Area, to interconnect an Eligible External ETU, [3] to materially change an existing\nGenerating Facility, to materially change an Eligible External ETU, or to increase the capability of an\nexisting Generating Facility or Eligible External ETU.\n\nThe NCIS is defined in the LGIP, the SGIP and the ETU IP of the Tariff.\n\nThe basic principle underlying the study approach to making the determination of no significant adverse\nimpact is that the energy, incrementally injected by Generating Facilities or injected by virtue of the\nrequested objective associated with an ETU, is allowed to be dispatched in an economic, securityconstrained manner provided that there is no significant adverse impact on the reliability of the system,\nand that the ability to reliably and practicably operate the system is not compromised. Thus, when the\nnew Generating Facility or ETU is added to the system models used in the study, energy injections from\nother Generating Facilities, external transactions, other interface transfers or ETUs generally may be\nreduced by an amount not more than the net energy injection associated with the new Generating\nFacility or ETU, adjusted for changes in system losses caused by the redispatch.\n\nCCIS is defined in the LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP of the Tariff. [4]\n\n**1.2** **Interconnection Studies**\n\nAn Interconnection Study is an Interconnection Feasibility Study, an Interconnection System Impact\nStudy, an Optional Interconnection Study or a re-study thereof. The scopes of these studies are\ndescribed in the LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP of the Tariff. An Interconnection System Impact Study, or a restudy thereof, shall meet all of the requirements of this procedure. When the alternative\nInterconnection Feasibility study scope is elected, the analysis may consist of a limited subset of the\nanalyses in this procedure, focusing on the issues that are expected to be most significant for the\nproposed Generating Facility or ETU.\n\n**1.3** **Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Requests**\n\nThe approach used in the study of an Interconnection Request for an ETU will differ depending on the\ntype of ETU.\n\nWhen addition of a specific technology is identified in an ETU Interconnection Request, the study will\ntake into account the type of the facility and the project’s performance objective.\n\nWhen a performance objective associated with a specific Generating Facility(s) is identified in an ETU\nInterconnection Request, the study will take into account both the generation and the objectives.\n\n3 External ETUs eligible for NIIS are controllable Merchant Transmission (MTF) or Other Transmission Facility (OTF).\nIn this Planning Procedure, these External ETUs are referred to as “Eligible External ETUs.”\n4 The details regarding the conduct of the CCIS test are contained in Planning Procedure PP-10\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a performance objective of increasing transfer capability between points is identified in an ETU\nInterconnection Request, the study, while meeting the requirements of Section 7 of this procedure, will\naddress what is specified for:\n\n    - Transfer points (from/to)\n\n    - Transfer capability increase and direction(s) of flow\n\n**2.0** **Requirements for Interconnection Studies**\n\n**2.1** **General Requirements**\n\nThe Interconnection Studies of all Interconnection Requests for Generating Facilities and ETUs, conducted\nin accordance with Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7 of this procedure, shall identify the minimum required upgrades\nto meet all of the following requirements:\n\n    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must satisfy the requirements of ISO New England\nPlanning Procedure 3: “Reliability Standards for the New England Area Pool Transmission\nFacilities” (the “Reliability Standards”) and NPCC Directory 1, “Design and Operation of the\nBulk Power System” on a regional (i.e., New England Control Area) and sub-regional basis,\nsubject to the conditions analyzed; and shall not compromise the ability of the system to\nmeet NERC TPL-001: “Transmission System Planning Performance Requirements”.\n\n    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must not diminish system transfer capability,\nwhether limited by an individual constrained element or a relevant interface, below the\nlevel of achievable transfers during reasonably stressed conditions[5] and does not diminish\nthe reliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk power supply\nsystem and its component systems.\n\n    - For a proposed new Generating Facility in an exporting area, or ETU with a terminal in an\nexporting area, an increase in the transfer capability out of the exporting area is not\nrequired to meet this interconnection standard unless the transfer capability needs to be\nincreased to allow the proposed new Generating Facility or ETU to operate at the requested\nmaximum output even after the allowed redispatch described in this procedure.\n\n    - The proposed Generating Facility or ETU must not diminish system transfer capability,\nwhether limited by an individual constrained element or a relevant interface, below the\nlevel of possible imports into an importing area during reasonably stressed conditions and\ndoes not diminish the reliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk\npower supply system and its component systems.\n\n    - The addition of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU does not create a significant\nadverse effect on the ISO’s or local Transmission Owner’s ability to reliably operate and\nmaintain the system. Creation of new constraints, particularly due to stability or dynamic\nvoltage performance, may likely be deemed to be unacceptable, as this compromises the\nability to operate the system, especially where the number of existing interfaces cannot be\n\n5 Reasonably stressed conditions are defined in PP5-3 as “those severe load and generation system conditions\nwhich have a reasonable probability of actually occurring.” Reference PP5-3 for additional information\n\n\n-----\n\nincreased due to operating complexity. Creation of operating limitations, particularly those\ncaused by short circuit contribution or equipment with limited voltage ratings are also likely\nbe deemed unacceptable.\n\n**2.2** **System Configuration**\n\nAnalyses shall be performed with the existing system facilities and topology, with the addition of all\nPlanned transmission projects (those with approved Proposed Plan Applications under Section I.3.9 of\nthe Tariff) and with all relevant Generating Facilities and ETUs with active Interconnection Requests\nalong with their associated upgrades in the Interconnection Queue ahead of the Generating Facility or\nETU under study. [6]\n\nIn situations where some of the above projects have later in-service dates than the Generating Facility\nor ETU under study, the Interconnection Study may need to analyze the topology when the Generating\nFacility or ETU goes into service and the topology when all of the above projects are planned to be in\nservice. In addition, sensitivity analysis shall be performed as appropriate for proposed transmission\nfacilities that are relevant to the Interconnection Study for the Generating Facility or ETU under study. [7]\n\n**2.3** **Load Levels**\n\nThe following load levels may be utilized in Interconnection Studies:[ 8]\n\n    - Peak load: Load shall be at 100% of the projected (“90/10 forecast”) peak New England\nControl Area load for the year the Generating Facility or ETU is projected to be in service\n\n    - Intermediate Load: 18,000 MW New England Control Area load\n\n    - Light Load: 12,500 MW New England Control Area load\n\n    - Nighttime Minimum Load: 8,000 MW New England Control Area load\n\n    - Daytime Minimum Load: 12,000 MW New England Control Area load\n\n**2.4** **Resources** **[9]**\n\nFor steady-state and stability analysis performed at summer peak load levels, the maximum output for a\nGenerating Facility shall be its summer Network Resource Capability (“NRC”) value, its maximum output\nat fifty degrees Fahrenheit or higher. For steady-state and stability analysis performed at intermediate,\nlight and minimum load levels, the maximum output for a Generating Facility shall be its winter NRC\nvalue, its maximum output at zero degrees Fahrenheit or higher. For controllable ETUs, steady-state and\nstability analysis shall be done with the maximum flow (in one direction if unidirectional or in each\n\n6 Reference Section 2.1 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n7 Reference Sections 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional\ninformation\n8 Reference Section 2.2 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n9 Reference Section 2.3.1 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information on NRC and\nSection 2.3 for additional information on treatment of different types of resources\n\n\n-----\n\ndirection if bidirectional) described in the requested objective.

[10]\n\n**2.5** **Second Contingency Testing**\n\nSufficient steady state and stability N-1-1 testing to assess performance relative to NERC, NPCC and ISO\nNew England criteria shall be performed. [11]\n\n**2.6** **Data Provision**\n\nThe LGIP, SGIP and ETU IP specify data submittal requirements for the associated stages of each\nprocedure. Starting with the submission of the Interconnection Request and before the completion of\nthe System Impact Study, resources undergoing the Interconnection Procedures, shall submit all data\nthrough the Interconnection Request Tracking Tool (IRTT)[12]. NERC Standard MOD-032[13] requires that\ndynamic models be provided for Generating Facilities, HVDC lines, and other power electronic devices\nthat are a part of the Bulk Electric System. ISO Operating Procedure OP-14 Section II.A.6 also requires\ndynamics models for Generating Facilities that are 5 MW or greater in size when ISO New England\ndetermines it to be necessary for the ISO to carry out its responsibility to reliably and efficiently operate\nthe power system.\n\nAppendix B describes the usability and acceptability requirements for PSS/E models for use in\nInterconnection Studies and in accordance with NERC Standard MOD-026 and MOD-027.\n\nResources undergoing the ISO Interconnection Procedures, shall submit the as-studied data through the\nDynamics Data Management System (DDMS) and Short Circuit Data Management System[14] after the\nSystem Impact Study results have been accepted by the Interconnection Customer at the System Impact\nStudy Results Meeting.\n\n**3.0** **Steady-State Analysis**\n\n**3.1** **Steady-State Criteria**\n\nSteady-state analyses shall be performed to demonstrate compliance with applicable voltage and\nthermal loading criteria and shall identify any system upgrades required to satisfy these criteria.\n\n**3.2** **Steady-State Stresses**\n\nSteady-state studies shall be performed with a dispatch of Generating Facilities, with flows on\ncontrollable ETUs, and with imports and exports such that it stresses power flows across applicable\n\n10 Reference Appendix K of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n11 Reference Section 3.4 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n12 The IRTT system can be accessed from the ISO New England website at: http://www.iso-ne.com/systemplanning/transmission-planning/interconnection-request-queue\n13 Refer to ISO New England Compliance Bulletin - MOD-032 – Model Data Requirements and Reporting\nProcedures for additional information on generator characteristics located at:\nhttp://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc\n14 The DDMS and SDMS systems can be accessed via the SSO/SMD home page by selecting the Dynamic Data\nManagement System application or Short Circuit Data Management System application. Instructions will be\nprovided to Interconnection Customers during the interconnection process.\n\n\n-----\n\ntransmission lines or interfaces. A stressed line or interface shall, to the extent reasonable, be at or near\ntheir ratings or transfer limits.\n\nA reasonable condition when power flows may not be at or near their transfer limits would exist when\nthe maximum number of fully loaded Generating Facilities and ETUs that may reasonably be expected to\nbe in service does not result in stressed power flows.\n\n**3.3** **Steady-State Redispatch**\n\nThe steady-state portion of an Interconnection Study typically includes an analysis of the transmission\nsystem without the proposed Generating Facility or ETU (pre-project case) and an analysis of the\ntransmission system with the proposed Generating Facility or ETU in service (post-project case). The\nchange to output of Generating Facilities and external controllable ETUs from the values in a pre-project\ncase to the values in the post-project case is commonly referred as redispatch.\n\nAs a result of the addition of the proposed project, the maximum collective change in the output of\nother generation and changes to the flows of controllable external ETUs (the maximum redispatch) to\nmeet the Reliability Standards must not exceed the capacity of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU,\nas measured by its intended high limit.\n\nIf the request for interconnection involves multiple generating units at a Generating Facility and the\napplicant for interconnection controls all the existing generating units at that Generating Facility, the\napplicant for interconnection shall specify the desired maximum output for the Generating Facility in the\nInterconnection Study Agreement and the design of the interconnection shall be based on this specified\nmaximum output.\n\nIn addition, the following restricts the pre-contingency redispatch of Generating Facilities or external\nETUs for first contingency (N-1) conditions:\n\n    - Redispatched Generating Facilities and redispatched ETUs and the new Generating Facility\nor ETU must be able to be automatically monitored and observed for purposes of system\noperation and unit commitment (for example a facility monitored and controlled by the\nSystem Operator via SCADA and security constrained economic dispatch), and,\n\n    - Generating Facility and ETU redispatch is not acceptable for limiting system constraints that\noccur on sub-transmission or lower voltage (less than 100 kV) facilities.\n\nSecond contingency (N-1-1) testing considers two initiating events that can occur close together in time.\nFollowing the first initiating event, system adjustments can be made in preparation for the next\n\n\n-----\n\ninitiating event.[ 15] In the case of pre-second contingency Generating Facility or ETU runback and/or\ntripping after a first contingency to be secure for N-1-1 conditions:\n\n    - The runback and/or tripping that can be assumed to be achievable in 30 minutes following\nthe first contingency shall utilize available replacement operating reserves consistent with\nPP3.\n\n    - Generating Facilities and ETUs that are assumed to be runback or tripped (which may\ninclude the new Generating Facility or ETU) must be able to be automatically monitored and\nobserved for purposes of system operation and unit commitment (for example a facility\nmonitored and controlled by the System Operator via security constrained economic\ndispatch), and, Generating Facility and ETU runback or tripping is not acceptable for limiting\nsystem constraints that occur on sub-transmission or lower voltage (less than 100 kV)\nfacilities, except as follows;\n`o` where the first and second contingencies are not contingencies listed in PP3 and where\nthe potential performance violation is for a facility that is not a Pool Transmission\nFacility, runback or tripping of non-market generation and/or Settlement Only\nGenerators may also be assumed in the assessment. The assessment must confirm that\nsuch redispatch is operable [16] and does not introduce any other performance violations.\n\n**3.4** **No Increase in Conditional Dependence**\n\nIf no existing Generating Facility or ETU is required to be in service to avoid criteria violations for the\nconditions studied prior to placing the new Generating Facility or ETU in service, no existing Generating\nFacility or ETU can become required to operate as a condition for acceptable operation of the new\nGenerating Facility or ETU for that study condition. If an existing Generating Facility or ETU is required\nto be in service to avoid criteria violations for the conditions studied prior to placing the new Generating\nFacility or ETU in service, the existing Generating Facility or ETU may continue to be modeled as required\nto avoid criteria violations, but such reliance shall not be increased. Generating Facilities and ETUs that\ncontinue to be required to be in service to avoid criteria violations for the conditions studied shall not be\nreduced, by redispatch in the study, below the level required for system reliability before the addition of\nthe Generating Facility or ETU. Studies must examine relevant stressed existing Generating Facility and\nETU outage conditions in addition to outages or reductions that have been considered as part of\nGenerating Facility and ETU redispatch.\n\n**3.5** **Post Contingency Resource Adjustments**\n\nNo Generating Facility or ETU can be manually tripped or manually ramped down to relieve any first\ncontingency facility loading in excess of the more limiting of either the Short Time Emergency Ratings or\nany other applicable Transmission Owner-specific emergency ratings. Manually ramping down\nGenerating Facilities or ETUs to relieve first contingency overloads within the more limiting of the Short\nTime Emergency ratings or any other applicable Transmission Owner specific emergency ratings can only\nbe applied to the Generating Facility or ETU under study, provided that the Generating Facility or ETU\nreduction is acceptable to the ISO. If a reduction in Generating Facility or ETU output is required in the\n\n15 Reference Section 3.4 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n16 For example, the constraints and generation output levels may need to be fully observable to, and controllable by,\nthe operator and the implementation must be scalable and manageable in the context of reliable operating practice.\n\n\n-----\n\npre-project system in order to relieve overloads the same reduction shall be allowed in the post project\ncase.\n\n**3.6** **Steady-State Load Levels**\n\nSteady-state analysis shall be performed at the following load levels and in accordance with Table 3-1\nbelow. Not all scenarios will be studied for every project. Scenarios will be selected as part of the project\nstudy scoping process:\n\n    - Analysis shall be performed at Peak Load with the Generating Facility or ETU operating at\nfull capability.\n\n`o` Four scenarios may be analyzed:\n\n           - An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, low solar, and energy\nstorage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are\navailable up to their full capability.\n\n           - An evening peak scenario characterized by high load, no solar, and energy\nstorage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are\navailable up to their full capability[17]\n\n           - A mid-day peak scenario, characterized by high load, high solar, and energy\nstorage unavailable, while wind and conventional resources are available up\nto their full capability\n\n           - A mid-day peak scenario, characterized by high load, high solar, and energy\nstorage available for charging, while wind and conventional resources are\navailable up to their full capability\n\n    - Analysis shall be performed at Intermediate Load with the Generating Facility or ETU\noperating at full capability in the cases where conditions such as the preservation of transfer\ncapability are a concern.\n\n`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:\n\n           - A shoulder load scenario characterized by intermediate load, no solar, and\nenergy storage available for charging, while wind and conventional\nresources are available up to their full capacity\n\n           - A shoulder load scenario characterized by intermediate load, no solar, and\nenergy storage available for discharging, while wind and conventional\nresources are available up to their full capacity\n\n    - Analysis shall be performed at Light Load as required by the ISOto identify any upgrades that\nare required to allow the Generating Facility or ETU to operate at the requested output level\nwhile no other nearby generating facilities (that would contribute to any identified\nviolations) are operating.\n\n`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:\n\n           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, high solar, and energy\nstorage available for charging, while wind and conventional resources are\navailable up to their full capacity\n\n17 The evening peak with no solar scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project\n\n\n-----\n\n           - A light load scenario characterized by light load, no solar, and energy\nstorage available for discharging, while wind and conventional resources are\navailable up to their full capacity\n\n    - Analysis shall be performed at Minimum Load in cases where the Generating Facility or ETU,\nand its Interconnection Facilities and Network Upgrades, add a significant amount of\ncharging current to the system or in areas where there are significant resources without\nsignificant voltage control.\n\n`o` Two scenarios may be analyzed:\n\n           - A Day-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, high\nsolar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional\nresources are available up to their full capacity\n\n           - A Night-Time minimum load scenario characterized by minimum load, no\nsolar, and energy storage unavailable, while wind and conventional\nresources are available up to their full capacity[18]\n\n    - Co-Located or Hybrid facilities may be required to analyze the combination of all scenarios\nlisted under the different resources of which they are comprised\n\n    - Other Load levels and resource scenarios may be added at the discretion of the ISO where\nneeded.\n\n    - BTM-DERs and other non-Modeled assets will be modelled as dispatched at the resource\navailability level as shown in table 3-1 below\n\n_Table 3-1 - Steady State Scenarios[192021]_\n\n**_Available Scenarios/For_** Solar Availability Across Batteries/Stored Wind Conventional\n**_Consideration_** NE (Both Market and Hydro Availability Resources\n\nBTM) Availability Availability\n\nPeak Load 90/10 (Gross) 26% 100% 100% 100%\nLow Solar Discharging\n\nPeak Load 90/10 (Gross) 85% 0% 100% 100%\nHigh Solar OFF\n\nPeak Load 90/10 (Gross) 85% 100% 100% 100%\nHigh Solar Charging\n\n18 The night time minimum load scenario may be required if there are topology changes associated with the project.\n19 Availability is interpreted as projects under their respective fuel types are able to be dispatched anywhere between\na projects minimum power (PMIN) and the level listed multiplied by the projects maximum power (PMAX).\n20 Intermittent resources that are dispatched at a lower level than their max availability will not be assumed to be\navailable for re-dispatching post N-1\n21 Gross is interpreted as prior to the addition of the DER, netting down of the load. As where Net is interpreted as\nthe load post addition of the DER. For example, the daytime minimum load scenario lists 12000MW (Gross), if\n5000MW of DER is added, the net load is then 7000MW. For the light load scenario with high solar, 12,500 (NET)\nis listed, if 5000MW of DER is added, the net load would be 7,500MW, so the scalable load would need to be scaled\nup commensurate to the DER added, to meet the required 12,500MW NET level. In the cases where NET=Gross is\nlisted, this means there is no netting of the load due to the DER because there is no DER assumed.\n\n|Available Scenarios/For Consideration|Solar Availability Across NE (Both Market and BTM)|Batteries/Stored Hydro Availability|Wind Availability|Conventional Resources Availability|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Peak Load 90/10 (Gross) Low Solar|26%|100% Discharging|100%|100%|\n|Peak Load 90/10 (Gross) High Solar|85%|0% OFF|100%|100%|\n|Peak Load 90/10 (Gross) High Solar|85%|100% Charging|100%|100%|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Peak Load 90/10 (NET = Gross) No Solar|0%|100% Discharging|100%|100%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Shoulder Load 18,000MW (NET = Gross)|0%|100% Charging|100%|100%|\n|Shoulder Load 18,000MW (NET = Gross)|0%|100% Discharging|100%|100%|\n|Light Load 12,500 (NET)|100%|100% Charging|100%|100%|\n|Light Load 12,500 (NET = Gross)|0%|100% Discharging|100%|100%|\n|N-Minload 8,000MW (NET = Gross)|0%|0% OFF|100%|100%|\n|D-Minload 12,000MW (Gross)|100%|0% OFF|100%|100%|\n\n\n**4.0** **Stability Analysis**\n\n**4.1** **Stability Criteria**\n\nStability analyses shall be performed to demonstrate compliance with applicable criteria and shall\nidentify any system upgrades required to satisfy these criteria.\n\n**4.2** **Stresses in Stability Analysis**\n\nFor normal contingency testing, power flows across applicable transmission lines or interfaces shall be at\nthe most limiting of the existing stability or thermal (set using winter transmission equipment ratings,\nwith appropriate margin, for light load testing) transfer limits.

A Generating Facility that\nhas notified the ISO that it will retire will not be included in short circuit studies for timeframes beyond\nits retirement date.\n\n**6.0** **Other Requirements**\n\n**6.1** **Voltage Control and Reactive Power Requirements**\n\nWhere specified in Schedule 22, 23 or 25, Generating Facilities, ETUs and their associated\nInterconnection Facilities, that are capable of voltage control, are required to be capable of a composite\n\n25 Availability is interpreted as projects under their respective fuel types are able to be dispatched anywhere between\na projects minimum power (PMIN) and the level listed multiplied by the projects maximum power (PMAX).\n26 Intermittent resources that are dispatched at a lower level than their max availability will not be assumed to be\navailable for re-dispatching post N-1\n27 Reference Section 4.3 of the ISO New England Technical Planning Guide for additional information\n\n|Available Scenarios/For Consideration|Solar Availability Across NE (Both FERC and Non- FERC)|Batteries/Stored Hydro|Wind Availability|Conventional Resources Availability|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Peak Load 90/10 (Gross) Low Solar|26%|Discharging|100%|100%|\n|Peak Load 90/10 No Solar|0%|Discharging|100%|100%|\n|Light Load 12,500 (NET)|100%|Charging|100%|100%|\n|Light Load 12,500 (NET = Gross)|0%|Discharging|100%|100%|\n|N-Minload 8,000MW (NET = Gross)|0%|OFF|100%|100%|\n|D-Minload 12,000MW (Gross)|100%|OFF|100%|100%|\n\n\n-----\n\npower delivery at their maximum rated power output (maximum MW) at the Point of Interconnection\n(or at the high side of the station transformer, or at the Point of Interconnection if there is no station\ntransformer, in the case of a non-synchronous Generating Facility) at both the power factor of 0.95\nleading and 0.95 lagging. Further, all Generating Facilities equal to or greater than 5 MW will be required\nto be capable of a composite power delivery at their maximum rated power output (maximum MW) at\nthe Point of Interconnection[28] (or at the high side of the station transformer, or at the Point of\nInterconnection if there is no station transformer, in the case of a non-synchronous Generating Facility)\nat both the power factor of 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging. The Interconnection Study shall verify this\ncapability.\n\nSystem Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the voltage control capability with the\nrequirements of OP-14. For all generating facilities equal to or greater than 5 MW, the study will assume\nthat the Generating Facility’s responsiveness to voltage changes is active and in-service, unless the study\nidentifies that such responsiveness cannot be activated (for example because of the pre-existing voltage\ncontrol strategy for a distribution feeder).\n\nWhile it shall be identified in the Interconnection Study if the voltage control strategy must be designed\nwith the purpose of maintaining a scheduled voltage at the Point of Interconnection (or some other\nappropriate point), it shall be acceptable for the resource to dynamically control its terminal voltage\nunder transient conditions, unless the Interconnection Study identifies a reliability issue that requires\nthe resource be capable of controlling voltage at another point, such as the Point of Interconnection.\n\nThe power factor evaluation shall be conducted with the new Generating Facility or Eligible ETU\nmodeled at unity terminal voltage and maximum rated power output. The maximum leading and\nlagging reactive power capabilities at maximum rated power output shall be taken from the associated\nfacility “D-Curve” or similar specification. At both the maximum leading reactive output and at the\nmaximum lagging reactive output, the real and reactive power losses in the step-up transformer(s) and\nother interconnection facilities, station service real and reactive load, as well any additional reactive\ncontribution provided by project auxiliary reactive devices, shall be calculated. The resulting net real\nand reactive power at the Point of Interconnection (or the high side of the station transformer in the\ncase of a wind generating facility) shall be required to meet the 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging dynamic\nreactive power standards. Generating Facilities that operate in a combined mode (such as combined\ncycle generation) shall be evaluated on an overall combined basis.\n\nSystem Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the voltage ride-through capability with\nthe requirements of NERC PRC-024, Generator Frequency and Voltage Protective Relay Settings.\n\n**6.2** **Governor Control/Frequency Response**\n\nSystem Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the new Generating Facility frequency\nresponse with the droop, deadband and overall response requirements of OP-14. Testing shall include\nan appropriate frequency changing event such as a large loss of load or generation.\n\nSystem Impact Study testing shall evaluate the compliance of the frequency ride-through capability with\nthe requirements of NERC PRC-024-1, Generator Frequency and Voltage Protective Relay Settings.\n\n28 The term “point of common coupling” is more commonly used for distribution-connected resources and will serve\nas the point of measurement for the purposes of this requirement for resources that are not interconnected pursuant\nto Schedule 23 (Small Generator Interconnection Procedures).\n\n\n-----\n\n**6.3** **Shaft Torque (Delta P) Testing**\n\nWhere there is a likelihood of large angular difference across an open transmission line, or of a large\nchange in power flow when closing a transmission line, an Interconnection Study for a Generating\nFacility shall include determination of the largest change in power (Delta P) that the Generating Facility,\nand other Generating Facilities in proximity, could experience as the result of reclosing following an N-1\ncontingency. The value of Delta P shall be included in the Interconnection Study report. The Generating\nFacility or ETU shall be required to mitigate any unacceptable consequence of increased Delta P which\nthey cause.\n\n**6.4** **Subsynchronous Resonance and Subsynchronous Torsional Interaction Screening**\n\nAn Interconnection Study for an HVDC facility or any project that includes a series-connected capacitor\nin Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades shall include screening for the potential of causing\nsubsynchronous stresses on nearby generation. This screening shall examine N-1, N-1-1 and other\npotential contingent or operating conditions specified by the ISO. The results of this screening shall be\nincluded in the Interconnection Study report.\n\n**6.5** **Electromagnetic Transient Testing**\n\nAny inverter-based Generating Facility, including DER, an ETU that includes power electronics as part of\nthe facility or a Generating Facility or ETU that includes power electronics as part of Interconnection\nFacilities or Network Upgrades shall provide a Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) model(s) useable in\nPSCAD, of that equipment. The need for a EMT model will be discussed at the Scoping Meeting for noninverter based technology.. The EMT study shall examine N-1, N-1-1 and other potential contingent or\noperating conditions specified by the ISO. Guidance regarding the requirements for PSCAD model\nsubmittals and for EMT testing is provided in Appendix C. [29]\n\nThese EMT requirements shall not apply to wind or inverter based Generating Facilities that are not\nconnected to the PTF and that are not subject to the requirements of Schedules 22 or 23 of the OATT,\nunless ISO New England identifies that the EMT requirements are needed to be met by the Generating\nFacility for reliability reasons.\n\n**6.6** **Operating Procedure Requirements**\n\nAn Interconnection Study shall ensure that the Generating Facility or ETU satisfies the relevant\nequipment design requirements in Operating Procedures OP-12, OP-14 and OP-19.\n\n**6.7** **IEEE 2800 Requirements**\n\nNon-synchronous resources participating in the first ISO-NE Cluster study, pursuant to FERC Order No.\n2023, (and all subsequent clusters) must meet the requirements of Appendix F.\n\n29 Only state jurisdictional projects that are part of studies that will start after the initiation of the Transition Cluster\nStudy pursuant to FERC Order No. 2023 will be required to meet section 6.5\n\n\n-----\n\n**7.0** **Additional Considerations for Studies of ETUs**\n\nThe appropriate study of an Interconnection Request for an ETU will differ depending on the type and\nobjective of the ETU.\n\n**7.1** **Eligible External ETUs**\n\nThe scope of study of Eligible External ETUs is described in Section 2 of this procedure. The analysis of\nETUs that have one or more terminals outside of the New England Control Area shall be coordinated\nwith the other Control Area(s). The analysis at the point of injection to the New England transmission\nsystem shall be performed similar to the analysis of a Generating Facility connecting at that terminal.\nThe impact of loss of the ETU when it is operating at full output shall be analyzed.\n\nThe analysis of a new Eligible External ETU shall include analysis with relevant existing external\ninterfaces modeled with imports and exports at the maximum levels used in planning studies.\n\n**7.2** **Internal Controllable ETUs**\n\nA controllable ETU could be a HVDC line or an AC line with a phase-angle regulator or other control\ndevice.\n\nIn a manner consistent with other parts of this procedure, the Interconnection Customer shall identify\nthe generator dispatch or dispatches that will be used to provide the energy and/or capacity transmitted\nby the ETU at each terminal which is drawing power from the transmission system. The analysis shall\nidentify the system upgrades required to maintain the reliability of the sending area in accordance with\nNew England planning standards. This analysis shall be similar to the analysis that would be conducted if\na new load was added at the point of withdrawal from the New England system.\n\nThe analysis at the point of injection to the transmission system shall be performed similar to the\nanalysis of a Generating Facility connecting at that terminal. The analysis shall identify the system\nupgrades required to maintain the reliability of the receiving area.\n\nThe impact of loss of the ETU when it is operating at full output shall be analyzed.\n\n**7.3** **Non-controllable ETUs Involving Specified Equipment Additions without Associated**\n**Specified Objectives**\n\nThe analysis of a non-controllable ETU involving specified equipment additions without specified\nobjectives shall be conducted consistent with the analysis of transmission additions pursuant to PP5-3.\n\n**7.4** **ETUs Involving Specified Objectives**\n\nAn ETU Interconnection Request may not always specify the equipment that it wishes to install. For\nexample, a request may have the objective to increase the transfer limit across an interface by a certain\namount. When an ETU Interconnection Request specifies an objective without specifying facilities, the\nstudy shall identify the solution necessary to satisfy the needs identified in the Interconnection Request\nand shall identify the transmission upgrades required. Section 3.1 of the Elective Transmission Upgrade\nInterconnection Procedures states that the ISO, at its sole discretion, determines if a proposed objective\nis appropriate to propose in a single Interconnection Request.\n\n\n-----\n\n**8.0** **Preliminary Nonbinding Overlapping Impact Studies**\n\nAn Interconnection Customer with a Capacity Network Resource Interconnection Service (“CNRIS”)\nRequest or a Capacity Network Import Interconnection Service (“CNIIS”) Request may request that the\nFeasibility Study or System Impact Study include a preliminary, non-binding, analysis to identify\npotential upgrades that may be necessary for the Interconnection Customer’s Generating Facility or\nExternal ETU to qualify for participation in a Forward Capacity Auction (“FCA”) under Section III.13 of the\nTariff, based on a limited set of assumptions to be specified by the Interconnection Customer.\n\nThe preliminary, non-binding analysis shall use the same criteria and assumptions that are prescribed in\nthe analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts in Planning Procedure 10: Planning Procedure to\nSupport the Forward Capacity Market (“PP10”). The starting point for the base case to be used in the\npreliminary analysis shall be the latest developed base case that has been prepared, pursuant to PP10,\nfor the analysis of New Generating Capacity Resources seeking to participate in an FCA.\n\nThe set of additional assumptions that may be specified by the Interconnection Customer are limited to\nadditional transmission projects and/or generation projects with active Interconnection Requests under\nthe L/SGIP that the Interconnection Customer requests to be added to the base case.\n\nTo the extent the Interconnection Customer requests a preliminary non-binding analysis of Overlapping\nInterconnection Impacts under the CCIS, a report shall contain the results of the requested preliminary\nanalysis, along with an identification of potential upgrades that may be necessary for the\nInterconnection Customer’s Generating Facility to qualify for participation in a FCA pursuant to Section\nIII.13 of the Tariff.\n\nAn Interconnection Customer with an ETU Interconnection Request may specify as its performance\nobjective a capacity transfer capability increase. As part of the Feasibility Study or the System Impact\nStudy for this Interconnection Request, as requested by the Interconnection Customer; an analysis\nsimilar to a preliminary, non-binding analysis shall be performed to verify the increase in capacity\ncapability. In this case, the study shall include all relevant Generating Facilities and ETUs with earlier\nqueue positions and all Planned transmission projects.\n\n**9.0** **Operational Considerations**\n\nAs appropriate, the analysis shall include an assessment of the operating constraints of the proposed\ntransmission and generation system without identifying the additional upgrades (beyond those\nidentified pursuant to Section 2 of this procedure) necessary to reduce the operating constraints. The\nanalysis shall determine the estimated magnitude of required redispatch of generation under typical\nand reasonably stressed conditions. If requested by the ISO, limited operating studies may be required\nto demonstrate viable operability of the proposed Generating Facility or ETU and provide some\nindication of the system conditions for which the Generating Facilities or ETU’s operation may be\nrestricted. The conditions to be considered in these studies shall be coordinated through the ISO.\nExamples of studies that may be expected include, but are not limited to:\n\n   - Examination of the operation of the proposed transmission or generating facilities over\nexpected or suspected constrained conditions with examination of the limiting performance\nconcern (for example thermal, voltage or stability issues). Hour-to-hour operability or\nperformance over longer periods may be considered. Light, intermediate or peak load levels\nmay be considered. Any increased need for operational oversight of the system, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nresource operating restrictions, atypical switching or the creation of additional procedures\nunder outage conditions shall be noted.\n\n   - Determination if the system adjustments required to reliably serve the area of interest within\n30 minutes following the first contingency change significantly, or are no longer effective,\ngiven the proposed change.\n\n(Note: Extensive operating studies, separate from the Interconnection Studies, may be necessary prior\nto actual operation.)\n\n**10.0** **Additional Considerations for Generating Facilities that include Storage**\n\nThe study of the discharging (i.e. generating) operating condition of a proposed electrical storage facility\nshall use the study approaches described in this procedure. The study of the charging (i.e. absorbing)\noperating condition of a proposed electrical storage project shall use the study approaches described in\nthis procedure except that it will not be studied under any of the Peak Load scenarios listed in section\n3.6.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Document History[30]**\n\n**Rev.

This document describes only the general transmission\nsystem design requirements for new Generating Facilities and ETUs to interconnect to the Pool\nTransmission Facilities (PTF). Additional technical and design requirements related to resource\ninterconnection and operation may also apply.\n\n**Point of Interconnection**\nThe following shall be applied to the design of a new Generating Facility (resource) or ETU\ninterconnection:\n\n1. All new Generating Facilities or ETUs shall be connected to the system at a new or existing\nstation on the existing Administered Transmission System.\n\n2. The station shall be designed to provide independent switching of each Generating Facility or\nETU interconnection to the system and each transmission line terminating in the station. The\nintent is to design the interconnection in a manner that does not adversely affect the ability to\nmaintain major components of the transmission system.\n\n3. A ring bus or breaker-and-a-half connection shall be used at the point of Generating Facility or\nETU interconnection with the transmission system. Transmission system needs and use may\nrequire a breaker-and-a-half arrangement. Alternative interconnection designs to Non-PTF\nfacilities shall be considered where appropriate. Additionally, two circuit breakers placed in\nseries may be required to mitigate the consequences of a stuck breaker that would otherwise\nresult in an unacceptable system performance.\n\n4. Transmission system circuit breakers shall not be used for synchronization of new Generating\nFacilities.\n\n**Interconnection Design – Loss-of-Source**\nThe interconnection shall be designed such that, with all lines initially in service, there is no normal\ndesign contingency or common mode transmission system, station, or internal plant failure which could\nresult in a net loss of more than 1,200 MW of resources, except in the case of an increase of no more\nthan 2% above the maximum capability, in place at the time of the original incorporation of this\nprovision into PP5-6 in June 2016, of an existing facility that already corresponded to a loss of more than\n1,200 MW of resource for a normal design contingency.\n\n**Out of Step Protection**\nEach PTF connected synchronous generating resource shall be required to have out-of-step protection\ninstalled. This protection shall detect an out-of-step condition and trip the Generating Facility to protect\nthe transmission system against adverse impact associated with the Generating Facility losing\nsynchronism with the system. Additionally, the Transmission Owner and/or the ISO may require that\nsupplementary supervisory detection be used in conjunction with the out-of-step protection when\nnecessary to prevent unnecessary and undesirable out-of-step protection operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Transmission Circuit Breakers**\nAll new 345 kV and, where identified as necessary, 230 kV and 115 kV, circuit breakers must meet the\nrequirements of Planning Procedure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix B – Requirements of PSS/E Models**\n\nAll power flow and dynamic models must be made available for use in the version of PSS/E that is in use\nby ISO New England and must accurately model all of the relevant control modes and characteristics of\nthe equipment, such as:\n\n  - All available voltage/reactive power control modes\n\n  - Frequency/governor response control modes (which may be provided by a park controller)\n\n  - Low voltage ride through characteristics, if applicable\n\n  - Low frequency ride-through characteristics, if applicable\n\n  - Park controller or group supervisory functionality (e.g. for a wind farm)\n\n  - Appropriate aggregate modeling capability (e.g. for a wind farm)\n\n  - Charging or pumping mode, if applicable (e.g., for a battery energy storage device or pumped\nstorage hydro Generating Facility)\n\n**Standard Dynamics Models**\nFor all Interconnection Studies all models must be standard library models in PSS/E or applicable\napplications. Where applicable, the most up-to-date revision of the models must be used. User-written\nmodels will not be accepted.\n\n**User-Written Dynamics Models**\nA user written model is any model that is not a standard Siemens PSS/E library model. For all\nInterconnection Studies commencing before January 1, 2017, when no compatible PSS/E standard\ndynamics model(s) can be used to represent the dynamics of a device, accurate and appropriate user\nwritten models can be used, if accepted by ISO New England after testing.\n\nUser-written models for the dynamic equipment and associated data can be in either dynamic model\nsource code (.lib) or dynamic model object code (.obj) or dynamic linked library (dll):\n\n  - User-written source code, object code, and parameters shall be updated for the latest PSS/E\nversion in use and specified by ISO New England:\n\na. Dynamics models related to individual units shall be editable in the PSS/E graphic user\ninterface. All model parameters (CONS, ICONS, and VARS) shall be accessible and shall\nmatch the description in the model’s accompanying documentation. Certain CONEC or\nCONET models may be acceptable.\n\nb. Dynamics models shall have all their data reportable in the “DOCU” listing of dynamics\nmodel data, including the range of CONS, ICONS, and VARS numbers. Models that apply\nto multiple elements (e.g., park controllers) shall also be fully formatted and reportable\nin DOCU.\n\nc. Dynamics models shall be capable of correctly initializing and run through the simulation\nthroughout the range of expected steady state starting conditions without additional\nmanual adjustments.\n\nd. Dynamics models shall be capable of allowing its accompanying element or elements to\nbe switched out-of-service (including when the bus is disconnected) in the steady-state\nnetwork without additional steps and without errors. Documentation of any special\nrequirements for this condition shall be clearly defined in the model documentation.\n\ne. Dynamics models shall be capable of allowing all documented (in the model\ndocumentation) modes of operation without error.\n\n\n-----\n\nf. A park controller model to control more than one generator (e.g., in a wind farm or\nphotovoltaic park) shall be able to accurately control multiple equivalent generators.\nThe relative reactive output of each generator shall be correctly representative of its\nrepresentation of number of units and impedance data. The park controller shall be\nable to regulate a minimum of eight equivalent generator units.\n\ng. Dynamic models shall be coded in such way that any internal changes of model variables\nor parameters incurred in one simulation run shall not be automatically passed on to\nthe same models in subsequent simulation runs given both load-flow file and snapshot\nfile are restored in the same PSS/E application.\n\n  - Models requiring allocation of bus numbers shall be compatible with the New England bus\nnumbering system, and shall allow the user to determine the allocation of the bus numbers.\n\n  - Models shall initialize correctly and be capable of successful “flat start” and “ring down” testing\nusing the following guideline (models shall be capable of meeting these requirements when\noperating at full rated (nameplate) power, and also at partial power within the physical\noperating range of the equipment, across a range of feasible reactive power output conditions\nand terminal voltages):\n\na. 20 Second No-Fault Simulation (a/k/a “flat start”): This test consists of a 20 second\nsimulation with no disturbance applied. The test will be considered to be passed if the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n\ni. No generator MW change of 0.1 MW or more\n\nii. No generation MVAR change of 0.1 MVAR or more\n\niii. No line flow changes of 0.3 MW or more\n\niv. No line flow changes of 0.3 MVAR or more\n\nv. No voltage change of 0.0001 p.u. or more\n\nb. 60 Second Disturbance Simulation (a/k/a “ring down”): This test consists of the\napplication of a 3-phase fault for a few cycles at a key transmission bus, followed by\nremoval of the fault without any lines being tripped. The simulation is run for 60\nseconds to allow the dynamics to settle and will be considered to be passed if the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n\ni. No generator MW change of 1 MW or more from pre-fault to steady-state postfault conditions\n\nii. No generator MVAR change of 1 MVAR or more, except for exciters with dead\nband control (typically IEEE Type 4) from pre-fault to steady-state post-fault\nconditions\n\niii. No voltage change of 0.0001 p.u. or more, except in vicinity of exciters with\ndead band control from pre-fault to steady-state post-fault conditions\n\niv. No undamped oscillations related to the addition of the new user-written model\n\nUser-written model(s) shall be accompanied by the following documentation:\n\n  - A user’s guide for each model\n\n  - Appropriate procedures and considerations for using the model in dynamic simulations\n\n  - Technical description of characteristics of the model\n\n  - Block diagram for the model, including overall modular structure and block diagrams of any submodules\n\n  - Values, names and detailed explanation for all model parameters\n\n  - Text form of the model parameter values (PSSE dyr file format)\n\n  - List of all state variables, including expected ranges of values for each variable\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix C – Requirements of PSCAD Models**\n\n**1.0** **EMT model requirement**\n\nAs the penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) and distributed energy resources (DER) continues\nto grow, EMT models are required to support current and future study efforts which are required to\nmaintain a reliable power system. Models are required for one or more of the following reasons. Other\nspecialty studies may also be performed from time to time.\n\n   - Integration of IBR into low system strength networks\n\n   - Sub-synchronous control interactions (plant-to-grid)\n\n   - IBR controls interactions (plant-to-plant and within the plant)\n\n   - IBR controls stability (large and small disturbance)\n\n   - IBR frequency and voltage ride-through capability and performance\n\n   - IBR short-circuit current analysis\n\n   - Power quality studies (e.g., harmonics, rapid voltage change)\n\n   - Black start and system restoration studies\n\n   - Benchmarking and verifying RMS positive sequence dynamic models\n\n**2.0** **EMT Model Requirements**\n\nAs mentioned above, specific model requirements for a EMT study depend on the type of study being\ndone. A study with a scope covering weak system interconnection, ride-through, voltage control and\nevent response, and islanding performance (for example) would require a model which must meet the\nrequirements stated in Appendix C-1, and unless specified otherwise, this type of model is what is\nrequired.\n\n**3.0** **Model Submission Report Requirements**\n\nStudies utilizing electromagnetic transient tools such as PSCAD rely heavily on model accuracy and\nquality to be conducted in a timely manner.

A set of representative plots\nshall be provided to demonstrate performance [33].\n\n**Important Note**\nThese basic tests are requested to provide basic quality control and site-specific testing of the plant\nmodel. More detailed studies are required to analyze the phenomena described above, and the results\nof these studies may indicate problems which are not evident in these basic tests. For example,\ninteractions with nearby devices will be impossible to test in a simple model without detailed models of\nthe nearby devices available. Other issues may be found as more detailed system models and network\nconditions are tested.\n\n**3.5.1** **Detailed Instructions for the conduct of benchmarking analysis to confirm acceptable**\n**performance of the PSS/E model in comparison to the PSCAD model**\n\n**PSS/E Simulation**\n\n1.

Full dynamic testing to meet the requirements of this Planning Procedure\n\n**Use of Aggregate Models for Collector-Based Generating Facilities**\nFor the steady-state portion of the System Impact Study, including the detailed collector system analysis\ndescribed below, a fully explicit model of the collector system, including all branch connections and\nstep-up transformers shall be used.\n\nFor the stability portion of the System Impact Study, an equivalent model shall be used for each major\nfeeder branch of the Generating Facility. The following figure provides a representation of the\nappropriate equivalent to be used.\n\n**Collector system/GSU tap setting/voltage control strategy calculation**\nA detailed evaluation using a fully explicitly modeled collector-based Generating Facility allows for\nanalysis of voltage control strategies by showing the real and reactive power flow and losses across\nevery element of the facility. Being able to monitor the terminal voltage at each individual generating\nunit makes it possible to ensure each unit remains within a reasonable voltage range to avoid tripping.\nAll collector branches, junctions, individual high and low voltage busses (including the GSUs and\ngenerating units) shall be modeled using the configuration, network impedances, generating unit\nreactive capabilities and facility ratings for the project.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The following voltage regulation modes should be reviewed as appropriate:\n\n`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a remote bus\n`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a Park transformer high side bus\n`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a Park transformer low side bus\n`o` Generating units regulating voltage at a fixed power factor\n\n**Step 1 – Reactive Power Capability**\nThis step investigates the reactive power range of the overall Generation Facility and seeks to determine\nif the collector system design allows full reactive power capability. It also tries to determine what unit\nand station transformer taps allow for the largest reactive power injection range of the generating units.\n\n  - The POI may be modeled as a swing bus for this analysis. A fictitious machine may be placed at\nthe swing bus to consume the Project output and to allow for adjustment of transmission\nsystem voltages.\n\n  - Testing is performed to determine if the generating units would violate any voltage trip settings\ngiven the full leading and lagging reactive power range of the generating units.\n\n  - The reactive power output of the generating units is ramped to the maximum leading negative\nMVAR and to the maximum lagging capability positive MVAR for various system voltages and\ntransformer tap settings.\n\n  - If any bus voltage within the Project or collector system is outside of the specified range, the\ngenerating unit reactive power output for the wind park should be recorded along with the first\nbus that showed a voltage outside of the range. This information is used to determine which\ntransformer tap settings result in the greatest usable reactive power range of the generating\nunits as a way to pre-screen the testing required for Step 2.\n\n**Step 2 – Collector System Voltage Range**\nThe goal of this testing is to develop a strategy to maintain sufficient margin to the generating unit trip\nsettings and if possible maintain a preferred Generation Facility terminal voltage range (typically 0.95 to\n1.05pu) for any transmission system voltage (typically 0.9 pu to 1.1 pu).\n\n  - Testing is performed at different plant output levels 0% to 100% output in 10% intervals with\nequal loading across all individual generating units.\n\n  - For each of the applicable control strategies described above, and optimum tap settings from\nStep 1, a voltage profile is created and the minimum and maximum voltages within the facility is\nrecorded.\n\n**Step 3 – VAR impact to the System and Voltage Schedule Margin**\n\n  - The goal of this testing is to identify a strategy that will minimize the reactive power demand\nfrom the system under normal conditions, but also provide VAR support under low voltage\nconditions and consume MVAR under high voltage conditions.\n\n  - To ensure there is proper margin with the scheduled voltage (as determined by ISO during the\nstudy), +/-2% from scheduled voltage is evaluated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix E – Procedures for Material Modification Determinations**\n\nThis Appendix E provides implementation guidance in the application of the material modification\nprocedures contained in Schedules 22, 23 & 25 of the OATT.\n\nDifferent thresholds for determining Material Modification of a Generating Facility or ETU depend on\nthe stage of the project:\n\n1.

The process outlined in\n\nthis document will help enable consistency in Participating Transmission Owners’ project cost\n\nestimates, increase project costs transparency, and provide regular information about the\n\ntransmission investments made in the region and the impact to rates.\n\n2 **TERMS AND DEFINITIONS**\n\n2.1 Cost engineering definitions\n\nCost Estimate: A prediction of quantities, cost, and/or price of resources required by the scope of\n\nan asset investment option, activity, or project. As a prediction, an estimate must address risks\n\nand uncertainties. Estimates are used primarily as inputs for budgeting, cost or value analysis,\n\ndecision making in business, asset and project planning, or for project cost and schedule control\n\nprocesses. Cost estimates are determined using experience and calculating and forecasting the\n\nfuture cost of resources, methods, and management within a scheduled timeframe.\n\n  - Base Estimate: The Base Estimate is the original estimate (without contingency) in any\n\nestimate class (A, B, C or D). The Base Estimate will not change while the project is in the\n\nparticular estimate class and all cost adjustments will be based on this estimate. For a\n\nBase Estimate to change the project will need to be moved to a differed Estimate Class\n\n  - Escalation: The provision in actual or estimated costs for an increase in the cost of\n\nequipment, material, labor, etc., over that specified in the purchase order or contract due\n\nto continuing price level changes over time. Inflation may be a component of escalation,\n\nbut non-monetary policy influences, such as supply-and-demand, are often components.\n\n\n-----\n\nContingency: An amount added to an estimate to allow for items, conditions, or events for\n\nwhich the state, occurrence, or effect is uncertain and that experience shows will likely\n\nresult, in aggregate, in additional costs. Typically estimated using statistical analysis or\n\njudgment based on past asset or project experience.\n\nProject: For the purpose of this document, a Project shall mean a RBU developed though\n\nthe Solutions Study process pursuant to Section 4.2 of Attachment K of the OATT, or\n\nreconstructions/replacements of Pool Transmission Facilities included in the Regional\n\nSystem Plan and/or the ISO-NE Asset Condition List. Projects are broken down by\n\ncomponents in the RSP listing (Lines & Substations) but are typically permitted and\n\nreviewed as a whole for efficiency and resource/costs savings.\n\n- Project Scope: The sum of all that is to be or has been invested in and delivered by the\n\nperformance of an activity or project. In project planning, the scope is usually documented\n\n(i.e., the scope document).\n\n- Project Components: The breakdown of the Project into a subset. Examples of project\n\nelements would be a transmission line, substation, switching station, underground\n\ntransmission line, etc. As described above, these will typically correspond to an individual\n\nRSP Project ID number or Asset Condition List Project ID number.\n\n- Change in Scope: A change in the defined deliverables or resources used to provide them.\n\n- Right of way cost: All costs associated with the acquisition of new right of way including\n\neasements, land purchases, and associated agent, surveying (relative to land acquisition)\n\nand recording fees (as defined by FERC 350 account definition).\n\n- Level of Project Definition: This characteristic is based upon percent complete of project\n\ndefinition (roughly corresponding to percent complete of engineering). The level of project\n\ndefinition defines maturity or the extent and types of input information available to the\n\nestimating process. Such inputs include project scope definition, requirements documents,\n\nspecifications, project plans, drawings, calculations, learning’s from past projects,\n\nreconnaissance data, and other information that must be developed to define the project.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.2 Examples of Contingency & Scope Change\n\nThe variance to the cost estimate baseline falls into the two categories defined in section 2.1,\n\ncontingency or scope changes. Contingency typically reflects the risks associated with some of\n\nthe project elements. These risks are identified, quantified and a cost is associated with these\n\nrisks. Scope changes on the other hand accounts for project costs incurred as a result of changes\n\nto the project itself. The following list gives a few examples of each of these cost categories.\n\nSome examples for transmission project contingency are:\n\n      - Field condition design adjustment (e.g. field conflict)\n\n     - Incremental change to cost estimate (e.g. unit price increase) excluding general\n\nescalation.\n\n     - Estimating variances (e.g. quantity, equipment)\n\n     - Design development and changes within the original scope (e.g. pole placement\n\nless than 50ft)\n\n     - Market & vendor variations (e.g. price delta between vendors)\n\n     - Reasonable environmental condition or customer request adjustments (e.g.\n\navoiding stream)\n\n     - Weather impact on construction (limited to minor delays of few days or less)\n\n     - Permitting requirements (e.g. working hour restrictions, rare plants and species\n\nprotection measures)\n\nContingency usually excludes:\n\n     - Major scope changes such as changes in end product specification, capacities,\n\nbuilding sizes, and location of the asset or project;\n\n      - Extraordinary events such as major strikes and natural disasters;\n\n      - Escalation and currency effects.\n\nSome of the items, conditions, or events for which the state, occurrence, and/or effect is\n\nuncertain include, but are not limited to, planning and estimating errors and omissions,\n\nminor price fluctuations (other than general escalation), design developments and changes\n\n\n-----\n\nwithin the scope, and variations in market and environmental conditions. Contingency is\n\ngenerally included in most estimates, and is expected to be expended.\n\nSome examples for transmission project Scope changes are:\n\n     - Substation site relocation\n\n     - Design criteria change\n\n     - Currency effects\n\n     - Regulatory & permitting project definition changes (e.g. undergrounding\n\ntransmission or distribution lines, Army Corps of Engineer construction\n\nrequirements)\n\n     - Project re-Routes or relocation from the original Scope\n\n     - Changes to the project to accommodate compliance measures (Environmental,\n\nLand impact mitigation)\n\n     - Significant project delays (cost incurred through the escalation cost and the\n\ncarrying charges for the project, including capital interest)\n\n     - Major schedule changes\n\n\n-----\n\n3 **COST ESTIMATING PROCESS**\n\n3.1 Development of the cost estimate\n\nThe development of initial cost estimates takes place early in the regional planning process to\n\nallow for alternative comparison as well as alternative cost/benefit evaluation. As the project goes\n\nthrough its life cycle, different grade of estimates are developed and released. The different types\n\nof estimates are:\n\n    \n   - Conceptual Estimate[1]\n\n   - Planning Estimate\n\n   - Engineering Estimate\n\n   - Construction Estimate\n\nThe level of detail in the estimate will increase as the project develops. The level of project\n\ndefinition also varies depending on the stage of the project. The following shows the expected\n\nlevel of definition on various project phases and the corresponding estimate types:\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimate types per project phase\n\n3.1.1 Cost estimate components\n\nBase Estimate Development\n\nThe project estimate depends on the level of project definition as well as the type of estimate being\n\ndeveloped. At a minimum the cost estimate should be broken down by project elements (e.g. line\n\nsegments, substations etc…). The estimate shall conform to the template as described in section\n\n1 For Asset Condition Projects only.\n\n\n-----\n\n4 of this document. The following information and level of details should be provided at the different\n\nproject stages of the estimate development process:\n\n  - Concept project: Cost broken down by project elements (lines, substations, etc…).\n\nAnalogous cost estimating practices may be used to developed conceptual stage estimates\n\n(using similar past projects as a reference).[2]\n\n  - Proposed Project: Project characteristics should be refined (e.g. line mileage, major\n\nequipment specifications, etc…) so to achieve a project level of definition sufficient to\n\nachieve the level of accuracy targeted. Some preliminary engineering, field recognition may\n\nbe necessary to refine project knowledge.\n\n  - Planned Project: One line diagrams and preliminary design with proposed project location\n\nand equipment specifications need to be developed in order to increase the level of project\n\ndefinition. These requirements are already in place to enable Proposed Plan Application\n\n(PPA) approval and for the ISO to authorize the project to proceed.\n\n  - Transmission Cost Allocation (TCA): For TCA approval a. detailed estimate should be\n\ndeveloped and broken down by the following cost categories:\n```\n     o Material\n     o Labor\n     o Right of way costs\n     o Engineering, Permitting (Including administrative & legal cost) and Indirects\n     o Financing cost (AFUDC & Interest Costs)\n     o Escalation (using Handy Whitman or similar)\n     o Contingency\n\n```\nAt a minimum the project scope of work shall be developed and provided with the estimate (See\n\nreporting template for details in section 4 of this document)\n\nEscalation\n\nAt each of these stages costs should be calculated and the estimate expressed in year-of\nexpenditure dollars to reflect escalation. This can be done by assigning an inflation rate per year\n\n2 To be used for Asset Condition projects only.\n\n\n-----\n\nfor the different project cost elements. The selected year-of-expenditure should reflect a realistic\n\nscenario, taking into account project planning and permitting durations, as well as construction\n\ntimeframe. Inflation rates may be different for specific cost elements (e.g. substation vs.\n\ntransmission lines). Handy Whitman is a custom tailored index for the utility industry where\n\nupdates are released twice a year. This index follows the Uniform System of Accounts as defined\n\nby the Electric Code of Federal Regulations (Title 18) and is used by the utility companies for tax\n\npreparation and depreciation purposes. Despite its historical basis it does provide accurate trends\n\nthat may be used to anticipate inflation rates. Estimates should clearly specify how inflation is\n\nconsidered in the estimate and clearly state that the estimate is expressed in year-of-expenditure\n\ndollars. Multiple sources may be used for determining the inflation rate, including other nationwide\n\nand local references.\n\nContingency\n\nReasonable contingencies should be developed and evaluated for each project cost estimate.\n\nContingency captures uncertainties and cost risks within an estimate. The contingency should\n\nadhere to the definition as provided in Section 2 of this document and is dependent on the level\n\nof project definition. Some general guidelines for contingency have been developed based on\n\nAACE definitions by EPRI and the Department of Energy and are shown in Table 1 above.\n\nMajor and more complex projects may include higher contingency levels based on increased\n\nproject risks and challenges. Typically, as the project is refined, the contingency should reflect the\n\nshift of contingencies into actual cost categories. Transmission Owners should manage risks and\n\nuncertainties to reduce the contingency used. However, per the AACE definition, historically,\n\ncontingency is expected to be expended and should be included in the estimates.\n\n3.2 Cost Estimate Accuracy & Contingency\n\nContingency and accuracy should not be confused. Where contingency reflects an amount added\n\nto a project cost estimate for project unknown and risks identified, accuracy reflects the probability\n\nthat the estimate will come within a predefined parameter (e.g. 90% confidence). Accuracy is\n\ndefined by the width of the bell curve distribution of the cost estimate. Contingency is fully part of\n\nan estimate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**AS THE PROJECT EVOLVES, THE COST ESTIMATE IS REFINED AND THE ACCURACY**\n\n**CHANGES AS FOLLOW:**\n\n\n**Most Likely**\n\n**Final Stage**\n\n**Accuracy Range**\n\n**-10 to +10%**\n\n\n**Most Likely**\n\n**Most Likely**\n\n**Most Likely**\n\n\n**Proposed Stage**\n\n**Accuracy Range**\n\n**-25 to+50%**\n\n\n**Planned Stage**\n\n**Accuracy Range**\n\n**-25 to +25%**\n\n\n4 **PROJECT COST ESTIMATES UPDATES**\n\n4.1 Submission of Project Cost Estimate Updates.\n\nFor Projects that are a Category 4 or 5 TCA (as identified in Section 1.5, Table 1, of Planning\nProcedure No. 4), a Project Cost Estimation Update must be submitted at least once a year to\nthe ISO and the RC. The update should correspond with the RSP Project List update and\n[should be sent to TCApps@iso-ne.com.](mailto:TCApps@iso-ne.com)\n\n4.2 Project Cost Estimate Template\n\nThe Project Cost Estimate Template will be used the first time a Project is reviewed. The Project\nCost Template will be completed one time and not changed unless the Project estimate’s class\nchanges. It is not necessary to submit a Project Cost Estimation Change Reporting Template\nwhen completing this template.\n\n4.3 Project Cost Estimate Change Reporting Template\n\nThe Project Cost Estimate Change Reporting Template will be used to update project costs and\ncompletion percentage. This is the template that will be used once a Project Cost Estimation\nTemplate has been completed. It is not necessary to update the Project Cost Estimation\nTemplate when completing this Template.\n\n\n-----\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATE & SCHEDULE SHEET\n\nTransmission Owner: RSP or ACL Project ID #’s:\n\nProject Name: Date:\n\nEstimate Grade: PPA # PPA Approval:\n\n1.

outlines the requirements, procedures, and application forms to be used in the\nsubmission and review of proposed plans pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the ISO New England\nTransmission, Markets and Services Tariff (the “Tariff”).\n\nEach submittal shall include an applicable completed application. Blank application form(s) are\nprovided in Attachments 1, 2, and 3 of this document.\n\nProposed plans submitted for review pursuant to Section I.3.9 must be supported by information\nand analysis. PP5-3 \"Guidelines for Conducting and Evaluating Proposed Plan Application\nAnalyses\" provides guidance on what information and analysis should be available to support a\nsubmittal. The completed applications and supporting materials describing and assessing the\nimpact of the proposed plans together shall constitute submittal of a Proposed Plan Application\n(PPA).\n\nEstablishment and maintenance of approval of a PPA establishes the determination that\nimplementation of the proposed plan will not have a significant adverse effect upon the reliability\nor operating characteristics of the Market Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s system or of the\nsystems of one or more other Affected Entities [1] and the Market Participant or Transmission Owner\nis free to proceed with the proposed plan.\n\nAs prescribed per this document, a Market Participant or Transmission Owner will submit a PPA to\nthe ISO. Where a non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner is involved, the non-Market\nParticipant or non-Transmission Owner must meet the same requirements as for a Market\nParticipant or Transmission Owner, except that a Market Participant or Transmission Owner on\nbehalf of the non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner must submit any PPAs. Typically,\nthe Transmission Owner that interconnects with the non-Market Participant or non-Transmission\nOwner will submit the PPA for the interconnection. If transmission facility changes are required to\ninterconnect non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner facilities, the Market Participant\nor Transmission Owner who owns, or will own, the facilities at the Point of Interconnection with\nthe non-Market Participant or non-Transmission Owner facilities is responsible for submission of\nthe Transmission PPAs. Joint Applications may need to be filed if systems of others are involved.\n\nMarket Participants or Transmission Owners must follow the “PPA Submittal Procedure” contained\nin Attachment 5 to this procedure for their submittal of PPAs to the ISO. This attachment details\nthe flow of information required under this planning procedure and Planning Procedure 5-3,\n“Guidelines for Conducting and Evaluating PPA Analysis,” to promote a smooth PPA review by the\nReliability Committee and review and approval by the ISO.\n\n**1.1** **Description of the Proposed Plan Application Process**\n\nThe ISO will coordinate the PPA process.\n\n1 See ISO New England Planning Procedures No. 5-0, “Procedure for Reporting Notice of Intent to Construct or Change Facilities in\nAccordance with Section I.3.9 of the ISO New England Tariff (Proposed Plan Application Procedure)\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\n**1.1.1** **Initial Assessment**\n\nThe complexity of proposed changes to the system can range from minor changes to major\nalterations. The intention of the Proposed Plan process is to match study effort and review effort\nappropriate to the complexity of the proposed change. In PP5-3 “Guidelines for Conducting and\nEvaluating Proposed Plan Application Analyses”, guidance relative to study effort is provided\nthrough a discussion of different study levels. PP5-3 defines four levels of analysis: Level 0, Level I,\nLevel II, and Level III. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner must discuss proposed plans\nearly in the process with the ISO and, as necessary, the host Transmission Owner for guidance\nregarding the appropriate level of study required or whether a PPA is needed.\n\nThe ISO will examine the proposed plans and evaluate the potential for significant adverse impact\non the stability, reliability, or operating characteristics of the interconnected system. Based on\nthis examination, the ISO will advise the Market Participant or Transmission Owner regarding\nwhether input should be solicited from other committees or any Affected Entity. Other\ncommittees include, but are not limited to, the Principal Committees.\n\nThe ISO will engage potentially technically impacted Affected Entities during the conduct of the\nstudies that will be used to support a PPA.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\n**1.1.2** **Submittal of a Proposed Plan Application**\n\nAll required materials, as described below, shall be sent with supporting documentation to the ISO\nwho will collect, distribute, and provide a record of the PPA to a Reliability Committee meeting for\nwhich action is expected. Submittals of PPAs or supporting materials that are received by the ISO\nafter the deadlines described below shall result in deferral of review to a following noticed\nReliability Committee meeting that satisfies the submission timing requirements of this procedure,\nunless, it is decided at the discretion of the officers of the Reliability Committee, to conduct the\nreview at the requested meeting.\n\nIn order for the ISO to conduct its review, the Market Participant or Transmission Owner shall\nprovide modeling data adequately representing the planned facility to the ISO prior to the\nsubmittal of the PPA documentation.

The schedule of milestones will be used to demonstrate due diligence to the Reliability\nCommittee and the ISO.\n\n**1.1.3** **Review and Consideration of a Proposed Plan Application**\n\nThe ISO will supply the Reliability Committee brief statements describing the ISO’s\nrecommendation on PPAs that require Level II or Level III analysis, including any opinions\nexpressed by Affected Entities regarding significant impacts that they believe to be insufficiently\naddressed. Such recommendations are preferably provided to the Reliability Committee with the\n\n9 For equipment installed with a new type of technology that cannot be represented by PSS/E standard library models, refer\nto OP-16 Appendix J and Planning Procedure 5-6 (PP5-6) Appendix B, which address user-written models.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\ndistribution of the meeting material and agenda. If any of the recommendations are not available\nat the time of the distribution of the meeting material and agenda, the recommendations should\nbe provided prior to the Reliability Committee acting on the PPA. If the recommendations are not\navailable by the time the Reliability Committee is prepared to act on the application, the\ncommittee may elect to defer action subject to the time constraints defined in Section 1.1.2.\n\nA draft motion describing the conditions of the approval for the PPA consistent with the Technical\nCommittee Bylaws will be distributed by the ISO.\n\nIf in reviewing the application and associated information, the Reliability Committee decides\nadditional information, review, or study is required prior to acting on the application, the\nReliability Committee may elect to defer action and solicit supplementary information, review, or\nstudy as required. Sources for such additional information may be, but are not limited to, the\nMarket Participant or Transmission Owner sponsoring the application, other Market Participants\nor Transmission Owners, the ISO, and other committees.\n\nThe actions the Reliability Committee may take are to defer action, recommend approval by the\nISO, or recommend disapproval by the ISO. The Reliability Committee is expected to act on all\nPPAs that require Level II or Level III analysis. Applications requiring Level I analysis do not need\napproval, but do need Reliability Committee concurrence that only Level I analysis is required.\n\nReliability Committee members will be responsible for establishing an understanding of each\napplication through their own knowledge, review of the documentation provided with the\napplication, and/or consultation with the ISO, and/or other committees.\n\nThe Secretary of the Reliability Committee will notify the Members and Alternates of the\nParticipants Committee and the ISO of the actions taken by the Reliability Committee. This written\nnotice will be delivered prior to the end of the fifth (5th) business day following a meeting of the\nReliability Committee as specified by the Technical Committee Bylaws. This notification will\nconstitute formal confirmation that such action was taken. The ISO will consider the\nrecommendations of the Reliability Committee in the process of approving/disapproving each PPA.\nThe ISO will transmit an official letter to the Market Participant or Transmission Owner submitting\nthe Application noting such approval or disapproval. Upon approval the Market Participant or\nTransmission Owner shall be free to implement the proposed plan in accordance with the Tariff,\nincluding compliance with any additional requirements contained therein, e.g. the requirements of\nthe process for the interconnection of new generating resources or modification of existing\ngenerating resources pursuant to Schedules 22 and 23 of Part II of the Tariff, subject to the terms\nof this document. If any Reliability Committee member provides a written objection to a PPA,\nsuch objection will be conveyed to the ISO. In the event that another Market Participant or\nTransmission Owner objects to the actions of the ISO, the Tariff specifies avenues for resolution of\nthe objection.\n\n**1.1.4** **Withdrawal of a Proposed Plan Application**\n\nWithdrawal of a PPA is indication that a Market Participant or Transmission Owner no longer\nintends to pursue a proposed plan. Should a Market Participant or Transmission Owner wish to\nwithdraw its PPA, a letter to that effect should be sent to the ISO. The ISO will distribute the\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\nnotice of withdrawal to the appropriate committees. Consideration as to which committees\nshould be notified will be subject to the stage of the processing of the application. PPAs associated\nwith projects that have withdrawn from the interconnection queue shall be considered\nautomatically withdrawn.\n\n**1.1.5** **Currency of Approved Applications**\n\nFollowing review and approval of the proposed plans associated with one or more PPAs,\nimplementation of the proposed plans must continue to be actively pursued for such applications\nto remain current. Any of the following conditions may result in a determination that approval of\nsuch applications is revoked:\n\na. Two years have elapsed from the proposed in-service date on the approved PPA(s) and the\n\nMarket Participant or Transmission Owner has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuit of\npermitting, licensing and construction of the approved proposed plans. For proposed\nplans associated with an application submitted pursuant to the Tariff (\"Tariff Application\"), a\nvalid and current Tariff Application shall constitute due diligence in pursuit of\nimplementation of the proposed plans.\n\nb. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner has not sufficiently modified the proposed\nplans as required to address the difference between the modeled and actual or expected\nsystem.\n\nc. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner has elected not to pursue completion of the\nproposed plans described in the approved PPA(s).\n\nd. The Market Participant or Transmission Owner makes a change in the scope of the proposed\nplans described by the original PPA.\n\ne. The PPAs were submitted for review and approved more than 5 years in advance of the\nproposed in-service date, and the Market Participant or Transmission Owner has not\ndemonstrated due diligence in pursuit of permitting, licensing and construction of the\napproved proposed plans through annual progress reports. For proposed plans associated\nwith an application submitted pursuant to the Tariff (\"Tariff Application\"), a valid and current\nTariff Application shall constitute due diligence in pursuit of implementation of the proposed\nplans.\n\nThe ISO, in consultation with the Reliability Committee, will notify the Market Participant or\nTransmission Owner where such conditions have led to the conclusion that the approval of the\nassociated PPAs may be revoked. However, within 90 days following notification of such action\nthe Market Participant or Transmission Owner may submit studies and/or information for review\nand approval by the ISO that addresses the issues leading to this conclusion in order to maintain\napproval of such applications. The ISO may modify the time limits identified above as appropriate.\n\nStudies must be updated and proposed plans modified accordingly if the actual or expected\nsystem is, as of the proposed plans’ actual in-service date, sufficiently different from what was\nmodeled in the analysis supporting the approved PPA(s). The updated studies will identify\nwhether a part of a proposed plan that is no longer being pursued, as identified per this\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\nProcedure, is a necessary component or condition of another proposed plan that has maintained\nits currency. In this case, a Proposed Plan approval associated with the necessary component or\ncondition will remain current.\n\n**1.2** **Time Limits Prescribed in Section I.3.9 of the Tariff for Review of a Proposed Plan**\n**Application for a New Plan or a Revised Proposed Plan Application for a Revised Plan**\n\nSection I.3.9 of the Tariff [10] requires each Market Participant or Transmission Owner to submit a\nPPA to the ISO at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed in service date. In the case of\ntransmission facilities developed through the Solutions Study process or the competitive solution\nprocess, no significant action (other than engineering reasonably necessary to support the\nSolutions Study or competitive solution process) shall be taken.\n\nAny revisions to a previously approved PPA proposed for implementation prior to the in-service\ndate of such previously approved Proposed Plan must be specified on a revised PPA form. The\ncompleted PPA form for a new plan or a revised PPA for a revised plan requiring analysis must\ninclude documentation of the analyses that have been determined to be required by the ISO, in\nconsultation with Affected Entities, as necessary, or the Reliability Committee. If during the PPA\nreview process a significant adverse impact on the New England Control Area system or any\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s system is identified, then the PPA will be rejected.\n\nDue to the amount of time required for the Proposed Plan process, Market Participants or\nTransmission Owners are strongly recommended to supply appropriate data, with adequate lead\ntimes for performance and completion of any anticipated analyses and its review by ISO as\ndescribed in “Level of Analysis Required” (see PP5-3, Section 3.1.2), prior to formal submittal of a\nPPA to the ISO. If the appropriate data is not supplied with adequate lead times for performance\nand completion of any anticipated analyses and its review by ISO, then implementation of the\nproposed plans may be delayed or rejected regardless of their stage of physical completion.\n\n**1.3** **Issues Not Covered by These Procedures**\n\nFor issues not covered by these or any other documented procedure, Market Participants or\nTransmission Owners are expected to discuss pertinent issues with, and seek guidance first from\nthe ISO. If the issue involves a policy decision, the ISO may suggest an approach for addressing the\nissue. Such approach may involve raising the issue for discussion, guidance, or decision from one\nor more committees.\n\n10 See also Section 2.06 of the Transmission Operating Agreement.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\n**2.0** **Additions or Changes Requiring Proposed Plan Applications**\n\nThis section identifies when a PPA is required based upon the type and/or size of facility.\n\n**2.1** **Generation Additions or Changes in Net Station Output**\n\nThe following table describes the PPA requirements and the level of analysis required for all new\ngeneration or changes in station output that meet the defined conditions.\n\n**Proposed Plan** **Study and** **Level of**\n\n**Modeling**\n\n**Generation Change[11][,]** **[12][,][13]** **Application** **Performance** **Analysis**\n\n**Requirements**\n\n**Required?** **Requirements** **Required[14]**\n\nRequirements of Requirements of\n\nNew or Increased Generation\nYes Planning Procedure Planning Procedure Level III\n≥5MW[15]\n\n5-6 and 5-3 5-6\n\n≥ 5 MVAR Unit or ≥ 10 MVAR Requirements of Requirements of\n\nStation Change in Reactive Yes Planning Procedure Planning Procedure Level III\n\nCapability [16] 5-6 and 5-3 5-6\n\nNone, unless the None, unless the\n\nNo. Notification Level 0 - Unless\n\nISO identifies that ISO identifies that\n\nForm[17] only is the ISO\n\na PPA is required, a PPA is required,\n\nNew or Increased Generation Required – Unless identifies that a\n\nin which case in which case\n\n>1MW and < 5 MW the ISO identifies PPA with Level\n\nRequirements of Requirements of\n\nthat a PPA is III analysis is\n\nPlanning Procedure Planning Procedure\n\nrequired required\n\n5-6 and 5-3 5-6\n\nNew or Increased Generation\n\nNo None None None\n≤1MW\n\nThis language only encompasses requirements related to the submission of PPAs under Section 3.9\nof Part I of the Tariff.

Transmission Applications\nmust be approved by the ISO.\n\nFor all major changes to transmission facilities with design voltages at or above 69 kV, the Market\nParticipant or Transmission Owner will supply the results of completed studies to the ISO\nsufficiently in advance of the Proposed Plan Transmission Application so that sufficient time for\nreview is allowed. This includes changes to generator leads and their associated equipment, such\nas a GSU. [18]\n\nPPAs associated with Elective Transmission Upgrades shall be submitted in accordance with this\nPlanning Procedure within 30 calendar days from the end of the Interconnection Customer’s\ncomment process following the completion of a System Impact Study pursuant to Schedule 25 of\nthe ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff.\n\n**2.3** **Demand Resource Additions and/or Incremental Updates**\n\nAny generation additions or changes, including Distributed Generation, should follow the\ngeneration submittal and notification requirements of this PP5-1, even if they are intended to\nparticipate in ISO New England markets as demand resources. No notification or submittal is\nrequired pursuant to this PP5-1, for demand resources that are not comprised of generation.\n\n**2.4** **Protection Systems**\n\nAny addition of, functional change in, or retirement of a Remedial Action Scheme or Automatic\nControl Scheme (as described in Section 1 of Planning Procedure 5-5) requires submission of a\nPPA. Such application will be treated the same as Section 2.2.\n\n**2.5** **Interconnections Operating at 69 kV or Above with Non-Market Participants or Non-**\n**Transmission Owners**\n\nInterconnections operating at 69 kV or above with non-Market Participants or non-Transmission\nOwners (such as a new connection with a neighboring Control Area) require a PPA to be approved\nby the ISO.\n\n**2.6** **Dynamic Controls System**\n\nAny addition or significant change in a continuously acting control system and associated devices\nthat respond to normal and abnormal system conditions or events, so as to change the stability,\nreliability, or operating characteristics of the bulk power system requires submission of a PPA. Any\n\n18 Major change, as used in this sentence, is equivalent to a Qualified Change.

This includes, but is not limited to significant changes in control\nsystems associated with static var and synchronous compensators, HVdc, generator excitation\nsystems, power system stabilizers and turbine governor systems. Please note that the provisions\nof Schedule 22, 23 and 25 of the ISO Open Access Transmission Tariff regarding modifications to\nexisting generators and Elective Transmission Upgrades must also be observed.\n\n**3.0** **Retirements**\n\nThis section identifies when a PPA is required based upon the type and/or size of facility.\n\n**3.1** **Requirements**\n\nGenerator retirements do not require the submission of a PPA. However, all requirements in the\nISO New England Manual for Registration and Performance Auditing (M-RPA) must be met.\nRetirement of a capacity resource must follow the requirements of Section III.13 of the Tariff.\n\n**4.0** **Facility Changes That Do Not Require Proposed Plan Applications or Revisions to**\n**Previously Approved Proposed Plan Applications**\n\nFacility changes, such as but not limited to the following, do not require PPAs or revisions to\npreviously approved PPAs:\n\n    - Routine protection and relaying changes only if there will be no increase in the fault\nclearing times and no material change in elements tripped for all events that would be\nanalyzed pursuant to the PPA process.\n\n    - Minor adjustments of parameters of continuously acting control systems from what\nhad been previously approved under a PPA (However, such adjustments must be\nconveyed to the ISO as part of the Applicant’s ongoing data provision requirements.)\n\n    - Disconnect switches\n\n    - Replacement in kind or with greater energy dissipation of surge arrestors\n\n    - Station automation\n\n    - SCADA\n\n    - Communications\n\n    - Metering\n\n    - Rehabilitation with like equipment that does not affect transmission capability\n\n    - Static wire changes\n\n    - Counterpoise changes\n\n    - Replacement in kind of line terminal equipment and bus conductor to increase thermal\ncapability (Such changes however require the Market Participant to submit revised\nNX-9 data to the ISO in accordance with OP 16 “Transmission System Data”)\n\n    - Reductions in capability that result from the retirement of the resource/asset\n\n\n-----\n\ng g\nMarket Participant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans\n\n**5.0** **Application Forms**\n\nAttachments 1, 2 and 3 are forms to be used to notify the ISO of proposed generation and\ntransmission changes.\n\n**5.1** **Summary Statement**\n\nEach application will include a summary statement describing the proposed change and its\npurpose, and explaining its impact on the system, if any.\n\n**5.2** **Design Voltage versus Initial Operating Voltage**\n\nWhere a transmission line will be operated initially at a voltage lower than its design voltage, both\nvoltage levels will be specified in the space provided. The procedure to be followed is determined\nby the initial operating voltage. A separate PPA is required when the line is to be converted to the\nhigher voltage.\n\n**5.3** **Protection System and Dynamic Control System Descriptions**\n\n**5.3.1** **Protection System Description**\n\nThe relaying section of the transmission form will describe the types of line relaying, backup\nrelaying, communications and reclosing to be installed. Breaker failure protection also will be\ndescribed. Any protective system that requires remote tripping, runback, or fast valving of\ngenerating equipment must be described in detail.\n\n**5.3.2** **Dynamic Control System Description**\n\nIf applicable, a description of the equipment and design considerations must be provided.

**Purpose**\n\nThis document details requirements and procedures, as well as provides sample forms to be used\nin planning activities that are conducted pursuant to Section III.12 of the Tariff - Calculation of\nCapacity Requirements and Section III.13 of the Tariff - Forward Capacity Market.\n\nThe ISO will update the base case model to be used in the activities described in this Planning\nProcedure based on transmission upgrades, load forecast and other system changes as\nappropriate. The ISO will also calculate inter-area and inter-zonal transfer limits as needed to\nsupport the Forward Capacity Auction (FCA).\n\nFor New Generating Capacity Resources,[1] seeking qualification to participate in an FCA, an initial\ninterconnection analysis is required if the project is not in possession of a completed Feasibility or\nSystem Impact Study under Schedule 22 -Large Generator Interconnection Procedures (LGIP) and\nSchedule 23 Small Generator Interconnection Procedures (SGIP) of Section II of the Tariff\n(collectively, (L/SGIP)). Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all New\nGenerating Capacity Resources where the total requested output is above the Capacity Network\nResource Capability (CNRC). Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all new\nActive Demand Capacity Resources. No overlapping impact analysis is performed in the case of\nimports qualifying for the Forward Capacity Market as Import Capacity Resources using existing\nimporting interfaces. For new Import Capacity Resources associated with an External Elective\nTransmission Upgrade (External ETU) that is eligible for Capacity Network Import Interconnection\nService (CNIIS), [2] seeking qualification to participate in an FCA, an initial interconnection analysis is\nrequired if the project is not in possession of a completed Feasibility or System Impact Study under\nSchedule 25 - Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Procedures (ETU IP) of Section II of\nthe Tariff. Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts is required for all Import Capacity\nResources associated with an Eligible External ETU where the total requested output is above the\nCapacity Network Import Capability (CNIC) of the Eligible External ETU. Also, de-lists and demand\nbids seeking participation in either an FCA or an Annual Reconfiguration Auction may be rejected\nfor reliability reasons.\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the conduct of these transmission planning\nstudies. Note that completion of studies in accordance with this guidance does not preclude the\npossibility that some results may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\n1 For clarity, a New Generating Capacity Resource includes a New Generating Capacity Resource that is associated with an Internal\nElective Transmission Upgrade (Internal ETU) in accordance with Schedule 22 or 23 of Section II of the Tariff.\n\n2 External ETUs eligible for CNIIS are controllable Merchant Transmission (MTF) or Other Transmission Facility (OTF). In this Planning\nProcedure, these External ETUs are referred to as “Eligible External ETUs.”\n\nISO-NE Public 5\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**2.0** **Timeline**\n\nNetwork topology development and power system base case development will be performed in\npreparation for each FCA and Annual Reconfiguration Auction in accordance with the procedures\noutlined in this document. A load forecast for the New England Control Area, States, and sub-areas\nfor the appropriate Capacity Commitment Period will be represented in the base case model.\nTransmission Owners will submit materials in support of transmission projects that are anticipated\nto be in service by the start of the relevant Capacity Commitment Period. The ISO will update the\nnetwork topology model based on these submissions and other system changes as appropriate.\n\nForward Capacity Auction qualification analyses for New Generating Capacity Resources, new\nActive Demand Capacity Resources and new Import Capacity Resources are initiated by the\nsubmittal of a New Capacity Show of Interest Form by the Project Sponsor of the resource. New\nCapacity Show of Interest Forms are due approximately 10 months prior to the FCA.\n\nParticipants submitting Ambient Air Static De-List Bids must submit qualification materials to the\nISO by the Existing Capacity Qualification deadline, which is approximately eight months before\nthe FCA.\n\nParticipants submitting Static De-List Bids, Export Bids, and Administrative Export De-List Bid must\nsubmit qualification and cost materials to the ISO by the Existing Capacity Qualification deadline,\nwhich is approximately eight months before the FCA.\n\nParticipants submitting Permanent De-List Bids, Retirement De-List Bids or substitution auction\n(SA) demand bids must submit qualification and cost materials (as applicable) to the ISO by the\nExisting Capacity Retirement Deadline, which is approximately 11 months before the FCA.\n\nDynamic De-List Bids are not qualified in advance of the auction and can be submitted during any\nround of the primary auction of the Forward Capacity Auction in which prices are below the\nDynamic De-List Bid Threshold.\n\nThe timeline depicted in Table 1 shows the major planning activities and contingent system\nplanning activities associated with New Capacity Resource qualification and de-list bid review in\npreparation for a single FCA.\n\nISO-NE Public 6\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**Table 1**\n**Timeline of New Capacity Resource Qualification and De-List Bid Review Activities**\n\n**Year N-5** **Year N-4** **Year N-3**\n\n**Activities in preparation for a single FCA**\n**(Capacity Commitment Period N)** Oct.

This list is the most current\nRegional System Plan Project List (“RSP Project List”), which is deemed, by the ISO,\nadequate to build the updated network model.\n\nb) The most current list of certified projects and/or project components.\n\nEach Transmission Owner shall review the lists and certify project(s) and/or project component(s)\nbased on their determination that a particular project or component will:\n\n  - Achieve, or not, an in-service date no later than the first day of the relevant Capacity\nCommitment Period, and\n\n  - Have, or not, a material impact on the final network model and the studies performed with\nit.\n\nThe responsible Transmission Owner(s) shall certify the project(s) and/or project component(s)\nwith the ISO by providing the detailed information described below, only if that information was\nnever provided as part of a prior certification or if the prior certification needs to be updated.\n\nFor each major project and/or project component being certified, the detailed information to be\nprovided to the ISO consists of:\n\n  - For each component of the project, a Critical Path Schedule as described in the template\nprovided in “Template Schedule” in Appendix E of this procedure,\n\n  - A FCM Network Topology Statement Letter, as contained in Appendix E, from a company\nofficer verifying that he/she has reviewed the schedule of each project component\nsubmitted to the ISO, that he/she concurs that the schedule is achievable, and that it is the\nintent of the Transmission Owner company to build the proposed transmission project in\naccordance with that schedule.\n\nThis detailed information shall be delivered to the ISO no later than fifteen calendar days after the\nrequest for certification by the ISO. If further requested by the ISO, the responsible Transmission\nOwner(s) shall also provide incremental data needed to update the ISO’s network model.

The ISO will use the evaluation criteria\ncontained in Section III.12 of the Tariff to determine whether to include the transmission project\nor element of the transmission project in the final network model for the relevant Capacity\nCommitment Period.\n\nOnce this step is complete, the ISO will assemble the final network model for use in the relevant\nCapacity Commitment Period studies described in this procedure.\n\n**4.0** **Transmission Interface Limit Analysis**\n\nThe methodology used to determine transfer limits is contained in Appendix I of the Transmission\nPlanning Technical Guide.\n\n**5.0** **Analysis of New Capacity Resources**\n\nAny New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible\nExternal ETU has a number of potential transmission planning impacts, as described in Table 3,\nwhich must be studied before it can interconnect. A valid Interconnection Request for Capacity\nNetwork Resource Interconnection Service, submitted and accepted in accordance with Schedule\n22 (LGIP) or 23 (SGIP) or 25 (ETU IP) of Section II of the Tariff, is required in order to seek\nqualification for the FCA. In the absence of a completed Feasibility Study or a completed System\nImpact Study, an initial interconnection analysis under the Network Capability Interconnection\nStandard (NCIS) is required for FCA participation. Analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts\nunder the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard (CCIS) is required for all New Generating\nCapacity Resources and Eligible External ETUs associated with Import Capacity Resources seeking\nqualification for the FCA, other than imports seeking to qualify as Import Capacity Resources using\nexisting importing interfaces. Table 3 compares the scope of an initial interconnection analysis\nunder FCM with the full list of potential impacts studied under a System Impact Study.\n\nAll potential impacts of New Generating Capacity Resources and ETUs, including changes to\nExisting Capacity if appropriate, are studied under either the L/SGIP or ETU IP. Analysis of New\nGenerating Capacity Resources and ETUs does not bypass the L/SGIP or ETU IP. Accordingly, all\nNew Generating Capacity Resources must complete the L/SGIP and all ETUs must complete the\nETU IP before becoming interconnected.\n\nISO-NE Public 10\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**Table 3**\n**New Generating Capacity and Import Capacity Resource associated with Eligible External ETU**\n**Potential Impacts and Interconnection Analysis Scope**\n\n**Potential System Impact**\n\n**Interconnection Analysis** **Scope of Analysis Required**\n**FCM Market Element**\n\n**under FCM** **before the project can**\n\n**Interconnect**\n\n**New Generating Capacity** -

New Generating Capacity\nResources and Import Capacity Resources associated with Eligible External ETUs will be\ndetermined to be in a single Load Zone if it can serve incremental load in that Load Zone, while\nsatisfying the deterministic criteria of PP3, NPCC Directory 1 and NERC TPL-001.\n\n**5.7** **Initial Interconnection Analysis under the Network Capability Interconnection Standard**\n\nUsing the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form, including the\ninformation provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP,\nas appropriate, initial interconnection analysis is performed consistent with criteria and conditions\ndescribed in ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-6 (PP5-6): Interconnection Planning\nProcedure for Generation and Elective Transmission Upgrades. The initial interconnection analysis\nof a New Generating Capacity Resource or an Eligible External ETU will be performed at the\nrequested Network Resource Capability (NRC) or NIC of the proposed project, respectively.\n\nFor the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU, if the following\nanalysis has not been or will not be conducted as part of a Feasibility or System Impact Study\nunder the L/SGIP or ETU IP, the objective of the initial interconnection analysis is to identify if any\nupgrades are needed to meet all of the following requirements:\n\na) Satisfy the thermal and short circuit performance requirements of PP3, NPCC Directory 1\nand NERC TPL-001 on a regional (i.e., New England Control Area) and sub-regional basis,\nsubject to the conditions analyzed.\n\nb) As a result of the addition of the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible\nExternal ETU, the maximum collective change in the amount by which other Resources must\nbe re-dispatched to meet the Reliability Standards, does not exceed the capacity of the New\nGenerating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU, as measured by its intended high\nlimit. If the request for interconnection involves multiple generating units at a plant and the\napplicant for interconnection controls all the existing generating units at that plant, the\nProject Sponsor for interconnection shall specify the desired maximum output for the plant.\n\nc) The proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU does not diminish\nthe transfer capability across any transmission line or relevant interface below the level of\nachievable transfers during reasonably stressed conditions and does not diminish the\nreliability or operating characteristics of the New England Area bulk power supply system\n\nISO-NE Public 15\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nand its component systems. For a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource in an\nexporting area, an increase in the transfer capability out of the exporting area, beyond the\nexisting export capability, is not required to meet this interconnection standard.\n\nd) The addition of the proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU\ndoes not create a significant adverse effect on the ISO’s ability to reliably operate and\nmaintain the system.\n\ne) Short Circuit analyses will demonstrate that short circuit duties will not exceed equipment\ncapability. All Resources that can physically and concurrently be in service, including those\nwith approved deactivated reserve status, will be modeled in service.\n\nSection 5.7.1 contains a detailed discussion of the application of initial interconnection analysis if\nthe above analysis has not been or will not be conducted as part of a Feasibility or System Impact\nStudy under the L/SGIP or ETU IP. If such analysis determines that violations occur for a proposed\nNew Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU which cannot be fixed in time for the\nrelevant Capacity Commitment Period, the resource will be qualified to participate in that FCA up\nto the amount that the resource can operate without fixing the observed violations, unless that\nlevel is less than the Resource’s Economic Minimum Limit. Section 5.10 contains supplemental\nguidelines for determining if a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) could or could not be\nimplemented in time for the Capacity Commitment Period.\n\n**5.7.1** **Detailed Methodology for Initial Interconnection Analysis under the Network Capability**\n**Interconnection Standard**\n\n**5.7.1.1.** **Network Capability Interconnection Standard Screening**\n\nThe goal of the NCIS screening portion of this procedure is to develop a list of potential\ntransmission line, equipment or interface loading problems, pre- or post-contingency, associated\nwith the New Generating Capacity Resource or Eligible External ETU. The New Generating Capacity\nResource or Eligible External ETU that is modeled in the base case is called a “study resource.” [9] All\nof the transmission lines, equipment and interfaces that are monitored for potential loading\nproblems are called “monitored elements.” These potential monitored element loading problems\nare identified by developing stressed transfer conditions to the starting base case[10] and then\ndetermining which monitored elements have the potential to overload due to the addition of a\nstudy resource.\n\n9 An Eligible External ETU will be modeled as an injection at the proposed interconnection point to the New England Control Area. The\ncontingency loss of the Eligible External ETU will model the effect of the loss of the relevant facility(ies) in the external control area.\n\n10 The base case is developed in accordance with Section 3 and Section 5.3 of this procedure.\n\nISO-NE Public 16\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nUsing the list of existing generators in New England, the NCIS screen sorts the list of generators\nfrom highest positive distribution factor (DFAX) [11] to highest negative DFAX for each monitored\nelement, pre- and post-contingency. The distribution factors are a measure of the responsiveness\nor change in electrical loadings on monitored elements due to a change in output from each\ngenerator in New England. The DFAX is expressed as a percent of the change in generation output.\nThe generators with a positive distribution factor DFAX are referred to as “harmer” generation\nbecause increasing the output of these generators results in more flow on the monitored element\nfor the specified contingency. The generators with a negative DFAX are referred to as “helper”\ngenerators because increasing the output of these generators reduces the flow on the monitored\nelement for the specified contingency. The NCIS screen is performed by completing a transfer\nfrom a source of harmer generation to a sink of helper generation for each monitored element.\nThe study resource is included in the model in this step of the screen to ensure that cases are\nidentified where the study resource can act as a harmer generator on a potentially overloaded\nmonitored element. A list of potentially overloaded monitored elements is saved for use in the\nremainder of the NCIS test.\n\n**5.7.1.2.** **Network Capability Interconnection Standard Test**\n\nThis portion of the NCIS procedure starts from the list of potential monitored element problems\nidentified during the NCIS screening. A more reasonable set of stressed conditions, described in\nthe following paragraphs, are then applied to these monitored elements to determine if any\nsystem problems are attributable to the study resource.\n\nThe percent loading on each monitored element is determined without the resource under study.\nThis will provide a base reference loading for the monitored element. The reference loading will be\ndeveloped by completing a transfer from a source of all harmer generation to a sink of all helper\ngenerators. If there is not sufficient helper generation to turn off to accommodate the increase to\nall harmer generation, then the transfer will continue from the worst harmer generators (highest\nDFAX) to the harmer generators with the lowest DFAX. The transfer will be limited when any\nmonitored element that was listed as a potential overload in the NCIS screen reaches a loading of\n100%.\n\nNext, the percent loading on each monitored element that was listed as a potential overload in the\nNCIS screen will be calculated by adding the additional flow resulting from the resource under\nstudy to the base reference loading. The additional loading caused by the study resource is\ncalculated based on a transfer from the study resource to the next available helper generator. If all\nhelper generation was already reduced as part of the base reference transfer then additional\nloading caused by the study resource will be calculated based on a transfer to the lowest DFAX\n\n11 Unless otherwise explicitly stated, distribution factors are calculated using New England load as a reference.\n\nISO-NE Public 17\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nharmer that was not already used as part of the base reference transfer. If no monitored elements\nare overloaded, the resource has passed this test.\n\nIf any monitored elements are overloaded after the addition of the study resource, it will be\ndetermined for each overloaded monitored element whether an equal or lesser amount of\ngeneration can be reduced such that the loading on that monitored element is brought below the\napplicable rating. For this re-dispatch test, helper generation should be increased in reverse order\nfrom the helper generation that was reduced when the study resource impacts were determined.\nIf the monitored element loading can be brought below the applicable rating then this unique\ndispatch will be applied to all other monitored elements to determine if any overload condition\nexists on the other monitored elements. If any other overloads occur, then a different re-dispatch\nsolution will be reviewed to determine if all overloads can be alleviated. In all cases, re- dispatched\ngeneration will be limited such that the total amount of MWs to be turned off to eliminate all\noverloads does not exceed the size of the study resource. Thus, the unique dispatch is tested\nagainst monitored elements that were listed as potential overloads in the NCIS screen associated\nwith the study resource.\n\n**5.8** **Analysis of Overlapping Interconnection Impacts**\n\nUsing the information contained within the New Capacity Show of Interest Form, including the\ninformation provided pursuant to an active Interconnection Request under the L/SGIP or ETU IP as\nappropriate, the analysis of overlapping interconnection impacts under FCM is intended to\ndetermine if a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource, an Eligible External ETU associated\nwith an Import Capacity Resource or new Active Demand Capacity Resource provides incremental\ncapacity to the system in manner that meets CCIS established in the L/SGIP or ETU IP. This means\nthat a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource or a proposed Import Capacity Resource with\nan Eligible External ETU will be qualified at the level at which it can operate without re-dispatch of\nother capacity resources as described in Section 5.8.1. New Active Demand Capacity Resources will\nbe analyzed in accordance with Section 5.8.4.\n\nThe qualification analysis of an Eligible External ETU will be performed at the lower of either the\nrequested CNIC of the Eligible External ETU or the MW quantity for the new Import Capacity\nResource associated with the Eligible External ETU. In the case where an Eligible External ETU has\nmultiple new Import Capacity Resources associated to it, the qualification analysis will be\nperformed at the lower of either the requested CNIC associated with the Eligible External ETU or\nthe sum of the MW quantities for the new Import Capacity Resources associated with the Eligible\nExternal ETU.\n\nISO-NE Public 18\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**5.8.1** **Detailed Methodology for Overlapping Interconnection Impacts Analysis**\n\nThe overlapping interconnection impacts analysis is performed in the form of a group study\ndefined as the Capacity Network Resource (CNR) Group Study under the L/SGIP and ETU IP. The\nCNR Group Study shall include: (i) all Interconnection Requests for CNR Interconnection Service\nand CNIIS associated with New Capacity Show of Interest Forms submitted to the ISO during the\nNew Capacity Show of Interest Submission Window for the purpose of qualifying resources for\nparticipation in the related FCA in accordance with Section III.13 of the Tariff; (ii) Long Lead Time\nFacilities (Long Lead Facilities), in accordance with Section 3.2.3 of the LGIP and ETU IP, and (iii) all\ninterconnection requests submitted to Interconnecting Transmission Owners or their distribution\ncompany affiliates pursuant to the applicable state tariff, rules or procedures associated with New\nCapacity Show of Interest Forms submitted to the ISO during the New Capacity Show of Interest\nSubmission Window for the purpose of qualifying resources for participation in the related FCA in\naccordance with Section III.13 of the Tariff. Section 4.1.1 of the LGIP, Section 1.5.2 of the SGIP and\nSection 4.1.1 of the ETU IP describe how CNR Group Study order is established. Performance of\nthe CNR Group Study commences at the close of the Show of Interest Submission Window.\n\nWhere a relationship between an Internal ETU and a specific Generating Facility seeking CNRIS has\nbeen established, the Queue Position rules in the L/SGIP and ETU IP determine the relevant order\nin which the Generating Facility’s Interconnection Request and the Interconnection Request for\nthe associated Internal ETU will be included in the CNR Group Study to assess the Generating\nFacility’s qualification in the FCM. When the Generating Facility and the associated Internal ETU\nare at different Queue Positions, the Generating Facility’s and the associated Internal ETU’s\nInterconnection Request will be included in the CNR Group Study at the lower of the Generating\nFacility’s or the associated Internal ETU’s Interconnection Request Queue Position. It is possible\nthat an Internal ETU may support more than one Generating Facility seeking CNRIS. Where the\nQueue Position for the Internal ETU’s Interconnection Request is lower than that of the associated\nGenerating Facilities, the Queue Positions for the Generating Facilities’ Interconnection Requests\nwill be used as a tie breaker to dictate the relative order in which the Generating Facilities’\nInterconnection Requests will be included in the CNR Group Study.\n\nTable 4 illustrates the examples of the resulting CNR Group Study Queue Positions in the case of a\nsingle Generating Facility Interconnection Request associated with a single Internal ETU.\n\nISO-NE Public 19\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**Table 4**\n**Overlapping Interconnection Impacts Analysis with ETU Study Order Example**\n\n**5.8.1.1.** **Testing and Re-dispatch Restriction**\n\nThe percent loading on each monitored element[12] is determined without the study resource. This\nwill provide a base reference loading for the monitored element. The reference loading will be\ndeveloped by completing a transfer from a source of all harmer generation with a distribution\nfactor (DFAX) of 3% or greater for the given monitored element to a sink of all other generators.\nThis transfer will be limited when a monitored element including a modeled intrazonal stability or\nvoltage limited interface reaches a loading of 100% or when all harmer generation with a\ndistribution factor of 3% or above have been turned on up-to their established CNRC in the case of\nan existing generator or at the requested CNRC in the case of a new generator.\n\nNext, the percent loading on each monitored element will be calculated by adding the additional\nflow resulting from the study resource to the base reference loading. The additional loading\ncaused by the study resource is calculated based on a transfer from the study resource to\ngeneration that is not included in the list of harmer generation with a distribution factor (DFAX) of\n3% or greater for the given monitored element.\n\n**5.8.1.2.** **Transfer Level Test Conditions**\n\nIn order to determine the base dispatch within the Load Zone under study, the generators will be\ndispatched, up to their CNRC, in a manner that reasonably stresses the system. Internal transfers\nwill be modeled to reflect various conditions ranging from 0 MW transfer up-to their transfer\nlimits. Imports from External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various conditions changing\n\n12 As defined in Planning Procedure No. 10, Section 5.7.1\n\nISO-NE Public 20\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nfrom 0 MW transfer up-to the associated capacity import limit. Internal transfers that are\nconstrained by the system’s voltage or stability performance will be monitored through the use of\ninternal proxy interfaces.\n\n**5.8.1.3.** **Qualification Transmission Upgrade Identification**\n\nFor each dispatch that is simulated per Sections 5.8.1.1 and 5.8.1.2 above, when the study\nresource is delivering its output, the list of those new overloads that result from the addition of\nthe study resource and any existing overloads that are worsened due to the addition of the study\nresource will be recorded. The list will identify each recorded overload that meets at least one of\nthe following thresholds:\n\n - An overload greater than 10 MVA above the applicable thermal rating of the transmission\nelement; or\n\n - An overload greater than or equal to 2% above the applicable thermal rating of the\ntransmission element; or\n\n - A transfer above the interface transfer capability of the modeled intrazonal stability or\nvoltage-limited interface.\n\n - The study resource will be responsible for recorded overloads that meet any of the abovelisted thresholds where, in relation to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting:\n\n   - The study resource has an observed distribution factor (DFAX) [13] greater than or equal to\n3%; or\n\n   - The study resource has an observed impact (as measured by DFAX times proposed MW)\ngreater than or equal to 3% of the applicable thermal rating of the transmission\nelement.\n\nThe study resource will not be responsible for increasing the transfer capabilities of interfaces that\nform the boundaries between existing Load Zones. Where the addition of the study resource,\nhaving been added as described in Section 5.8.1.1 above, results in a transfer across an interface\n(that forms the boundary between existing Load Zones) that is higher than the interface transfer\ncapability, then other harmer resources with the lowest DFAX located on the same side of the\ninterface may be reduced to bring the transfer level back to the interface transfer capability.\n\n**5.8.2** **Qualified New Generating Capacity Resources and Conditional Qualified New Capacity**\n**Resources**\n\nIf the analysis determines that violations occur for a proposed New Generating Capacity Resource\nor Eligible External ETU that is associated with a single Import Capacity Resource which cannot be\nfixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, the resource will be qualified to\nparticipate in the FCA up to the level that meets the CCIS without fixing the observed violations,\n\n13 In this section exclusively, distribution factors are calculated using the study resource’s Load Zone as a reference.\n\nISO-NE Public 21\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nunless that level is less than the Resource’s Economic Minimum Limit. Section 5.10 contains\nsupplemental guidelines for determining if a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) could or\ncould not be implemented in time for the Capacity Commitment Period.\n\nIf the ISO determines that because of overlapping interconnection impacts, New Generating\nCapacity Resources or an Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU that\nhave otherwise met the requirements to participate in the FCA in accordance with SectionIII.13 of\nthe Tariff cannot provide the full amount of capacity that they each would otherwise be able to\nprovide in the absence of the other relevant Existing Generating Capacity Resources and New\nGenerating Capacity Resources seeking to qualify for the FCA, those New Generating Capacity\nResources will be qualified for participation in the FCA on the basis of their Queue Position, as\ndescribed in the L/SGIP and ETU IP, with priority given to resources that entered the queue earlier.\n\nA New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible\nExternal ETU that meets the requirements of Section III.13 of the Tariff, but that would not be\naccepted for participation in the FCA as a result of overlapping interconnection impacts with\nanother resource having a higher priority in the Queue may be accepted for participation in the\nFCA as a Conditional Qualified New Capacity Resource.\n\n**5.8.3** **Detailed Methodology for restudy based on the results of the Forward Capacity Market**\n\nThe ISO shall complete a post-FCA restudy of the applicable Interconnection Studies and CNR\nGroup Study to determine the cost responsibility[14] for facilities and transmission upgrades\nnecessary to accommodate the Interconnection Request based on the results of the FCA or\nReconfiguration Auction through which the generator or Import Capacity Resource associated with\nan Eligible External ETU received a Capacity Supply Obligation.\n\nThe restudy (to be conducted in accordance with the L/SGIP and ETU IP for the purposes of\ndetermining the facilities and transmission upgrades required to meet the CCIS) shall include: (i) all\nInterconnection Requests for CNR Interconnection Service that obtained a Capacity Supply\nObligation in the FCA or Reconfiguration Auction; and (ii) Long Lead Facilities, as provided in\nSection 3.2.3 of the LGIP and ETU IP. Study resources will be included in the analysis based on their\nQueue Position in the L/SGIP and ETU IP interconnection queue as described in Section 5.8.1 of\nthis procedure.\n\nThe restudy shall include cleared Retirement and Permanent De-List Bids and SA demand bids\nfrom the FCA, when the inclusion of these cleared Retirement and Permanent De-List Bids and SA\n\n14 Cost estimates for the facilities and upgrades identified in the post-FCA restudy are provided by the applicable Transmission\nOwner.\n\nISO-NE Public 22\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\ndemand bids will reduce or remove the need for transmission upgrades identified in the pre-FCA\ngroup study described in Section 5.8.1 of this procedure.\n\nNote that the provisions of the L/SGIP and ETU IP are used to determine the transmission\nupgrades required to meet the Network Capability Interconnection Standard. However, as a result\nof the restudy, upgrades associated with earlier/higher-queued Generating Resources or Eligible\nExternal ETUs may need to be advanced, in accordance with the provisions of construction\nsequencing, by the study resource in order to achieve all its critical path schedule milestones in\ntime for its associated Capacity Commitment Period.\n\nThe results of the restudy will be included in the corresponding Interconnection Study report, as\nappropriate.\n\nThe restudy results will provide the list of transmission upgrades required to meet CNR\nInterconnection Service. These transmission upgrades must be included in the critical path\nschedule of the New Capacity Resource in accordance with Section III.13.3 of the Tariff, where\nprogress on the completion of these transmission upgrades must be reported by the Project\nSponsor, not the interconnecting Transmission Owner(s).\n\n**5.8.4** **Detailed Methodology for the Overlapping Interconnection Impact Analysis of New**\n**Demand Capacity Resources**\n\nStarting with the qualification review for the fifth Forward Capacity Auction for Capacity\nCommitment Period beginning June 1, 2014, new Active Demand Capacity Resources will be\nanalyzed for overlapping interconnection impacts. New On-Peak Demand Resources and New\nSeasonal Peak Demand Resources (collectively “Passive Demand Capacity Resources”) will not be\nanalyzed for overlapping interconnection impacts.\n\nUsing the methodology contained in Section 5.8.1, each Dispatch Zone will be analyzed to identify\nwhether any new resource could deliver capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is\ninterconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting. In those Dispatch Zones where,\nbecause violations occur which cannot be fixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment\nPeriod, no new resource could deliver capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is\ninterconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting, then, no new Active Demand\nCapacity Resources within that Dispatch Zone will be qualified to participate in the FCA (or\napplicable Annual Reconfiguration Auctions). To the extent that the new Active Demand Capacity\nResource could, without the inclusion of any other new resources submitted for qualification in\nthat Dispatch Zone, deliver any portion of its capacity from the Dispatch Zone to which it is\ninterconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting, then the full proposed amount of\nthe new Active Demand Capacity Resource shall qualify under the provisions of this Section.\n\nISO-NE Public 23\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nUsing the methodology contained in Section 5.8.1, any individual new Active Demand Capacity\nResource that is identified as interconnecting at a single nodal location from which no new\nresource could deliver capacity to the Load Zone to which it is interconnecting (because violations\nare identified which cannot be fixed in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period) will not\nbe qualified to participate in the FCA (or applicable Annual Reconfiguration Auctions). To the\nextent that the new Active Demand Capacity Resource could, without the inclusion of any other\nnew resources submitted for qualification at that nodal location, deliver any portion of its capacity\nfrom the nodal location to which it is interconnecting to the Load Zone to which it is\ninterconnecting, then the full proposed amount of the new Active Demand Capacity Resource shall\nqualify under the provisions of this Section.\n\n**5.9** **New Generating Capacity Resources and Import Capacity Resources associated with**\n**Eligible External ETUs seeking Qualification to submit a Supply Offer for an Annual**\n**Reconfiguration Auction**\n\nNew Generating Capacity Resources and Eligible External ETUs associated with an Import Capacity\nResource are analyzed for their ability to meet the CCIS in the FCA CNR Group Study and restudy\nprocesses described in this Planning Procedure. A New Generating Capacity Resource or an Import\nCapacity Resource associated with Eligible External ETUs that qualifies for an FCA but does not\nachieve a Capacity Supply Obligation may elect to have its critical path schedule monitored by the\nISO pursuant to the provisions of Section III.13 of the Tariff.\n\nA New Capacity Resource with a critical path schedule that is being monitored by the ISO and is\nexpected to achieve all its critical path schedule milestones (including completion of any\ntransmission upgrades necessary for the resource to obtain the requisite interconnection service)\nprior to the start of the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, and for which the Project Sponsor\nhas met all relevant financial assurance requirements, will be qualified to take on a Capacity\nSupply Obligation in an annual reconfiguration auction.\n\n**5.10** **Supplemental Guidelines for determining if a QTU could or could not be implemented in**\n**time for the Capacity Commitment Period**\n\nAround July 15[th] of each year, the ISO shall provide the Transmission Owners with:\n\n - The preliminary list of violations from the initial interconnection analyses [15] that resulted or\nwere worsened from the proposed addition of New Generating Capacity Resource(s) and/or\nEligible External ETU(s) associated with an Import Capacity Resource in their respective\nterritory.\n\nUpon receipt of the violations, each Transmission Owner shall review their list and perform an\nimplementation assessment identifying whether (1) sufficient transmission planning analysis has\n\n15 The initial interconnection analyses for a New Generating Capacity Resource are described in Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of this procedure.\n\nISO-NE Public 24\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\ntaken place to identify a qualification transmission upgrade (QTU) that addresses a given violation\nand (2) if a QTU has been identified whether or not that QTU could or could not be achieved in\ntime for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period.\n\nThe responsible Transmission Owner shall provide the detailed information described below to the\nISO:\n\n - For each violation, a “QTU Implementation Assessment” as provided in the template form in\nAppendix F of this procedure.\n\n - In cases where the Transmission Owner indicates in the QTU Implementation Assessment that\na QTU could be in place in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, a FCM QTU\nStatement Letter, as contained in Appendix F, from a company officer verifying that he/she\nhas reviewed the implementation assessment(s) for the QTU(s) and that he/she concurs when\na QTU(s) could be achieved in time for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period.\n\nThis detailed information shall be delivered to the ISO no later than thirty calendar days after\nreceiving the preliminary list of violations.\n\nAfter receiving the above information, the ISO will review the implementation assessments and\nStatement Letters. In determining whether the QTU(s) could or could not be implemented in time\nfor the relevant Capacity Commitment Period, the ISO will consider the following non- exclusive\nlist of factors:\n\n - Complexity of the transmission planning analysis (review of different transmission alternatives\nand I.3.9 review process)\n\n - Ease of siting and permitting\n\n - Ease of land and easement acquisition\n\n - Equipment procurement time\n\n - Ease of construction and characteristics of the required new facilities (for example, length of\nnew overhead line or underground cable)\n\n - Construction sequencing and time requirement\n\n - Need for significant outage scheduling\n\n - The extent to which issues such as those described in this list have already been addressed,\nimplemented or completed and/or the extent to which there are plans in place to address\nissues such as those described in this list\n\nQTU(s) frequently identified as required upgrades to interconnect generation and Eligible External\nETUs are grouped below into three categories of projects.

The actual time to complete any project is subject to consideration of the\nextent to which the project is already being implemented and/or consideration of the bulleted list\nof factors identified above and the extent to which these factors have been or are planned to be\naddressed, and must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The level of scrutiny applied by ISO-NE\nin determining whether a project can be completed in time will be, in general, higher for the\nprojects in Group “C”, relatively lower for projects in Group “B”, and lower still for projects in\nGroup “A”.\n\nApproximately one week after receiving the QTU Implementation Assessments, the ISO shall\nprovide the affected Project Sponsor(s) of a New Generating Capacity Resource(s) or an Import\nCapacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU with (1) the preliminary list of\nviolation(s) from initial interconnection analyses that resulted or were worsened due to the\nproposed addition of their New Generating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource\nassociated with an Eligible External ETU project and (2) the QTU Implementation Assessment(s)\nwith regards to those violation(s). The ISO shall indicate based on the preliminary QTU\nimplementation assessment that has been performed if a QTU could or could not be implemented\nin time for the start of the Capacity Commitment Period to address the given violation(s).\n\nIf, at any time after sending the preliminary list of violations, the ISO finds additional violation(s)\nthat resulted or were worsened from the proposed addition of New Generating Capacity\nResource(s) and/or Eligible External ETU associated with an Import Capacity Resource, the ISO\nshall share that information with the affected Transmission Owner(s) and provide a reasonable\nperiod of time to respond back to the ISO with a QTU Implementation Assessment and FCM QTU\nStatement Letter for each violation as described earlier in this procedure. Upon receipt of this\ninformation, the ISO shall review the implementation assessment(s) and Statement Letter(s) to\nassess if a QTU could or could not be implemented in time for the start of the relevant Capacity\nCommitment Period. Following this review, the ISO shall provide the affected Project Sponsor(s)\nwith the violation(s) that resulted or were worsened due to the proposed addition of their New\nGenerating Capacity Resource or Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External\nETU project as well as the corresponding QTU Implementation Assessment(s).\n\nIf, at any time, a Transmission Owner or Project Sponsor of a New Generating Capacity Resource\nor an Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU becomes aware of any\nnew information that may affect a QTU Implementation Assessment for a given violation, they\nshall promptly share that information with the ISO. The deadline for submitting new information\nto be considered by the ISO in its review of whether or not a QTU could or could not be\nimplemented in time for the start of the relevant Capacity Commitment Period shall be no later\n\nISO-NE Public 27\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nthan five business days before the issuance of the Qualification Determination Notifications for\nNew Capacity Resources.\n\n**5.11** **Import Capacity Resources using Existing Import Interfaces**\n\nNo initial interconnection analysis or overlapping interconnection impact analysis is performed for\nimports qualifying for the Forward Capacity Market as Import Capacity Resources using existing\nimporting interfaces. The capacity import capability of the interface is calculated pursuant to ISO\nTariff Section III.12.9.2.4.\n\n**5.12** **New Self- Supply Resources**\n\nNew Self-Supply Resources will be analyzed in the same way as all other new resources as\ndescribed in this procedure.\n\n**5.13** **Elective Transmission Upgrades**\n\nFor an Import Capacity Resource associated with an Eligible External ETU or a New Generating\nCapacity Resource that is supported by an Internal ETU, the information contained in Appendix G\nshall be provided pursuant to Section III.13.1.1.2.2.2(c) as part of the Critical Path Schedule.\n\n**6.0** **Transmission Security Analysis Requirement**\n\nPrior to each FCA, the ISO shall determine the capacity requirement of each import-constrained\nCapacity Zone, by performing a Transmission Security Analysis. The Transmission Security Analysis\nwill be performed in accordance with Section III.12.2.1.2 of Market Rule 1 and the assumptions\ndescribed in Section 7.2 and Appendix A of this procedure.\n\n**7.0** **Analysis of De-list Bids and Demand Bids**\n\nUsing the information provided in the de-list bid (Retirement De-List Bid, Permanent De-List Bid,\nStatic De-List Bid, Export Bid, and Administrative Export De-List Bid[16]) and prior to the FCA, the ISO\nwill analyze the thermal, voltage [17] and, if appropriate, stability, reliability impacts of de-list bids. A\nsample de-list bid application form is contained in Appendix D. [18] A fully completed de-list bid is\ndue by the pertinent FCA deadlines, as outlined in Market Rule 1.\n\n16 The reliability review shall be conducted once and shall remain valid for the multiyear contract period.\n\n17 Assuming the unit’s VAR capability is not reduced, it is assumed that there is no voltage impact for a partial de-list or partial demand\nbid.\n\n18 The sample de-list bid application form is for reference only. All de-list bid application submittals must be made using the Forward\nCapacity Tracking System.\n\nISO-NE Public 28\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nDuring the FCA, the ISO will analyze the thermal, voltage [19] and (to the extent possible and if\nappropriate) stability, reliability impacts of submitted Dynamic De-List Bids and SA demand bids.\n\nDuring the Annual Reconfiguration Auction, the ISO will analyze the thermal, voltage [20] and (to the\nextent possible and if appropriate) stability, reliability impacts of submitted demand bids.\n\n**7.1** **Criteria**\n\nThe following criteria will be used when conducting the analysis of de-list bids and demand bids:\n\n    - Thermal Analysis\n\n– Normal Rating – no contingency\n\n– LTE rating – for contingencies\n\n– Short Time Emergency (STE) rating – for contingencies where loading can be\nreduced below LTE within 15 minutes\n\n    - Voltage Analysis\n\n– Consistent with Transmission Owners’ Voltage Criteria\n\n– Consistent with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1 – Nuclear Plant\nTransmission Operations (M/LCC1)\n\n    - Stability Analysis (to the extent possible and if appropriate)\n\n– Consistent with the performance expectations described in the North American\nElectric Reliability Corporation (NERC), Northeast Power Coordinating Council\n(NPCC) and ISO-NE standards [21].\n\n**7.2** **Conditions**\n\n    - Study Period\n\n– The study period will reflect the Capacity Commitment Period N (1 year from\nJune 1st Year N to May 31st Year N+1).\n\n    - Transmission Topology\n\n– The analysis will use the transmission topology as discussed in Section 3 of this\nprocedure.\n\n19 Assuming the unit’s VAR capability is not reduced, it is assumed that there is no voltage impact for a partial de-list or partial demand\nbid.\n\n20 Assuming the unit’s VAR capability is not reduced, it is assumed that there is no voltage impact for a partial de-list or partial demand\nbid.\n\n21 NPCC Directory 1 and ISO New England OP19\n\nISO-NE Public 29\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n    - Load Level for States, Capacity Zones, and Sub-areas\n\n– For thermal and voltage analyses, load will be modeled at 100% of the 90/10\npeak New England Control Area load, as projected in the most recent approved\nforecast.\n\n– Sensitivity analyses at load levels lower than 100% of the 90/10 peak New\nEngland Control Area Load will be considered when such lower load levels might\nresult in high voltage conditions, system instability or other unreliable\nconditions.\n\n    - Resource Assumptions\n\n– All Existing Capacity Resources will be modeled at their Summer Qualified\nCapacity for the primary auction of the FCA.\n\n– Existing Capacity Resources and New Capacity Resources that acquired a\nCapacity Supply Obligation in the primary auction of the FCA will be modeled at\ntheir Capacity Supply Obligation in the SA of the same FCA.\n\n– Resources that meet the requirements of section 8.1.2 of this planning\nprocedure will be modeled at their contractual obligation amount.\n\n– Existing Capacity Resources will be modeled at the lesser of the Capacity Supply\nObligation or the Summer Qualified Capacity for the Annual Reconfiguration\nAuction for the relevant Capacity Commitment Period in which review is being\nperformed.\n\n    - Contingencies\n\n– All single-element contingencies and multiple-element contingencies as\ndescribed in OP19, Appendix J and M/LCC 15 will be considered.\n\n– N-1-1 contingency analysis will be performed for the relevant contingencies in\naccordance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC),\nNortheast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) and ISO-NE standards.[22] The N-1-1\ncontingency analysis will be performed to identify element-out conditions\ncombined with system conditions and contingencies that could result in an\nInterconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) [23] exceedance.\n\n    - Transfer Level Assumptions\n\n– Internal transfers will be modeled to reflect various conditions ranging from 0\nMW transfer up-to their bidirectional limits.\n\n22 NPCC Directory 1, ISO New England OP19 and M/LCC 15.\n\n23 IROL is defined in the Glossary of Terms used in NERC Reliability Standards as “[a] System Operating Limit that, if violated, could\nlead to instability, uncontrolled separation, or Cascading Outages that adversely impact the reliability of the Bulk Electric System.”\n\nISO-NE Public 30\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n– Transfers from External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various\nconditions ranging from 0 MW transfer up-to the total of ICR Tie Benefits [24] plus\neither qualified Existing Import Capacity Resource(s) for the FCA or cleared\nImport Capacity Resource(s) for the Annual Reconfiguration Auction, not to\nexceed the interface transfer limit.\n\n– Transfers to External Control Areas will be modeled to reflect various conditions\nranging from 0 MW transfer up-to either the total of qualified Administrative\nExport(s) for the FCA or the total of cleared Administrative Export(s) for the\nAnnual Reconfiguration Auction, not to exceed the interface transfer limit.\n\n    - One critical generator in the electrical vicinity of the resource associated with the delist bid under review will be assumed out of service.\n\nAppendix A of this procedure illustrates a detailed list of assumptions supporting the above\nconditions.\n\n**7.3** **Minimum MW Quantity Threshold**\n\nNo analysis is required to assess the individual impact of a de-list bid or demand bid with a MW\nquantity smaller than 5 MW. However, analyses may be conducted to assess the cumulative\nimpact of such de-list bids and demand bids, in conjunction with other de-list bids or demand\nbids.\n\nFor a full de-list or demand bid, the quantity analyzed is the resource’s Qualified Capacity, Capacity\nSupply Obligation or the lesser of the two depending on the type of de-list or demand bid and the\ntimeframe of review, as shown in Appendix A.\n\nFor a partial de-list or demand bid, the quantity analyzed is the MW reduction of the de-list or\ndemand bid and applied to the resource’s Qualified Capacity, Capacity Supply Obligation or the\nlesser of the two depending on the type of de-list or demand bid and the timeframe of review, as\nshown in Appendix A.\n\n**7.4** **Order of Review**\n\n**7.4.1** **De-list Bids for a Forward Capacity Auction**\n\nFor a Forward Capacity Auction, de-list bids and demand bids will be reviewed in the order\nprescribed by Section III.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1.\n\n**7.4.2** **Demand Bids for an Annual Reconfiguration Auction**\n\nFor an Annual Reconfiguration Auction, demand bids will be reviewed in the order prescribed by\nSection III.13.4.2.2(c) of Market Rule 1.\n\n24 As part of the development of ICR and related values for each FCA and each ARA3, tie benefits from neighboring Control Areas to\nNew England are calculated using probabilistic analysis in accordance with the methodology described in Section III.12.9 of the Tariff.\n\nISO-NE Public 31\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**7.5** **De-list Bids Rejected for Reliability**\n\nPursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1, de-list bids shall only be rejected for the sole\npurpose of addressing a local reliability issue, and shall not be rejected solely on the basis that\nacceptance of the de-list bid may result in the procurement of less capacity than the net Installed\nCapacity Requirement or the Local Sourcing Requirement for a Capacity Zone.\n\nFor thermal analyses, the capacity associated with the de-list bid or demand bid under review will\nbe maintained to address local loadings beyond the applicable thermal rating of the Element\nwhen the removal of the capacity results in either an increase to the loading beyond the\napplicable thermal rating of the Element greater than 10 MVA or an increase to the loading\nbeyond the applicable thermal rating of the Element that is greater than or equal to 2% of the\nElement’s applicable thermal rating.\n\nDe-list bids that retained their Capacity Supply Obligation as a result of a reliability review\nrejection will be modeled as Existing Capacity in all subsequent reliability reviews performed for\nthe Capacity Commitment Period under consideration until the reliability need has been met.\n\nFollowing each Annual Reconfiguration Auction, pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(e) of Market\nRule 1, the ISO will re-evaluate any and all de-list bids rejected for reliability reasons to determine\nif the reliability need which caused the ISO to reject the de-list bid has been met as the result of a\nnew transmission project, formerly de-listed resources, New Capacity Resource(s) having obtained\na Capacity Supply Obligation or updates to all relevant assumptions. Rejected de-list bids will be\nre-evaluated in the order that was used in the initial review and described in Section\nIII.13.2.5.2.5(a) of Market Rule 1.\n\nWhere a request for proposal (RFP) under Section 4 of Attachment K has been issued in response\nto a de-list bid rejected for reliability reasons, the ISO’s re-evaluation of the rejected de-list bid\nmay consider:\n\n1. Whether there are responses to the RFP with in-service dates prior to the relevant\nCapacity Commitment Period for the rejected de-list bid and the ISO determines that\nsome of those responses, including the Backstop Transmission Solution, are reasonably\nlikely to be in-service prior to the relevant Capacity Commitment Period for the rejected\nde-list bid; and\n\n2. Whether some of such responses are expected to address the reliability need(s) set forth\nin the RFP.\n\nIn such cases, responses to the RFP may be determined to be timely and sufficient to meet the\nreliability need caused by the rejected de-list bid.\n\nPursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5(f) of Market Rule 1, should the local reliability issue that caused\nthe ISO to reject the de-list bid be satisfied prior to or during the Capacity Commitment Period,\n\nISO-NE Public 32\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nthen the resource shall retain its Capacity Supply Obligation through the end of the Capacity\nCommitment Period for which it was retained for reliability. Resources that submitted Permanent\nDe-List Bids or Retirement De-List Bids shall be permanently de-listed or retired as of the first day\nof the subsequent Capacity Commitment Period (or earlier if the resource sheds the entirety of\nthe Capacity Supply Obligation as described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5.3(a)(ii) or Section\nIII.13.2.5.2.5.3(b)(ii)).\n\n**7.6** **Stakeholder Review**\n\nIn accordance with Section III.13.1.8.(e) of Market Rule 1, the ISO shall post on its website no later\nthan three Business Days after the Existing Capacity Retirement Deadline information (aggregated\nby Load Zone) concerning Permanent De-List Bids and Retirement De-List Bids, including\nPermanent De-List Bids and Retirement De-List Bids entered from the prior FCA. The ISO will\nprovide written notice to each affected Transmission Owner and the Reliability Committee after\nmaking this posting.\n\nThe ISO will consult with the impacted Transmission Owners after the Internal Market Monitor\n(IMM) provides their cost determination (early July timeframe) for Retirement De-List Bids and\nPermanent De-List Bids before finalizing the review of each de-list bid. The ISO will consult with\nthe impacted Transmission Owners after the Static De-list Bid finalization window[25] (early October\ntimeframe) for Static De-List Bids, Export Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids[26] before\nfinalizing the review of each de-list bid. The ISO will consult with the impacted Transmission\nOwners during the auction (early February timeframe) for Dynamic De-List Bids before finalizing\nthe review of each de-list bid.\n\n**7.6.1** **Reliability Review of Static De-List Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids at or**\n**below the FCA Starting Price, and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List**\n**Bids with Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement**\n**Determination Notifications and Export Bids that are below the FCA Starting Price**\n\nStudies to evaluate Static De-List Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids at or below the FCA\nStarting Price, and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices Contained in\nthe Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications and Export Bids that are\nbelow the FCA Starting Price will be completed in accordance with Section 7 of this procedure\nwhich outlines the scope, study assumptions, and methodology that will be used in assessing the\nreliability need.

If, at any time, the ISO becomes aware of any new information that may affect the\ndetermination of a de-list bid request, they will promptly share that information with the affected\nTransmission Owner.\n\nThe ISO will provide a summary of accepted de-list bids and the details of rejected de-list bids to\nthe Reliability Committee at their first meeting following the ISO’s auction results filing with FERC.\nThe Reliability Committee shall provide formal input and advice to the ISO with regard to rejected\nde-list bids after the relevant FCA through an advisory vote. Any member of the Reliability\nCommittee shall provide on-going input and advice to the ISO through comment as appropriate\nby requesting the Chair of the Committee to include a specific rejected or accepted de-list bid as\nan item for discussion at a future meeting of the Reliability Committee.\n\n**7.6.2** **Reliability Review of Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices**\n**Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement Determination Notifications**\n**that are at or above the FCA Starting Price and Retirement De-List Bids and Permanent**\n**De-List Bids where the Participant has opted into a Reliability Review**\n\nFor resources submitting a Retirement De-List Bid or Permanent De-List greater than the\nminimum MW quantity threshold described under Section 7.3 of this procedure the following\nsteps will be taken. The ISO will discuss with the affected Transmission Owners the scope, study\nassumptions, and methodology that will be used in assessing the reliability need beyond what is in\nthis planning procedure, as well as to develop a schedule for the review. In accordance with the\n\nISO-NE Public 34\n\n\n-----\n\ng g g pp\nForward Capacity Market\n\nTransmission Operating Agreement (TOA) Section 3.09 the ISO and Transmission Owners shall\ncooperate, in good faith, to evaluate each Retirement De-List Bid and Permanent De-List Bid. If\nthe ISO and affected Transmission Owners do not reach consensus, the ISO will determine the\nstudy characteristics and will delineate the affected Transmission Owners’ concerns and rationale\nin the final study.\n\nThe ISO will review study results with the affected Transmission Owners as they become available.\nFollowing the dissemination of the Internal Market Monitor’s Retirement Determination\nNotifications and the opt-in period to have the resource reviewed for reliability described in\nSection III.13.1.2.4.1(a) or Section III.13.1.2.4.1(b), the ISO will finalize the reliability review for the\nfollowing de-list bids to determine if the resource is needed for reliability: (1) Retirement De-List\nBids and Permanent De-List Bids with Prices Contained in the Internal Market Monitor Retirement\nDetermination Notifications that are at or above the FCA Starting Price; and (2) Permanent De-List\nBids and Retirement De-List Bids for which the Participant has opted to have the resource\nreviewed for reliability as described in Section III.13.1.2.4.1(a) or Section III.13.1.2.4.1(b). The ISO\nwill provide the affected Transmission Owners a draft determination report for these de-list bids\nwithin a reasonable period of time prior to the Reliability Committee meeting at which these delist bids will be subject to an advisory vote.\n\nThe affected Transmission Owners will communicate their opinion regarding the determination\nassessment of these de-list bid bids to the ISO.

The process for this fuel-security reliability review is set out in this Appendix I to PP10.\n\n**1.1** **Term and Sunset of this Appendix I**\n\nThis appendix shall remain in use for the period described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.a of the Tariff.\n\n**2.0** **Timeline and Applicability**\n\nThe timeline for and applicability for fuel security reliability reviews is set out at Section\nIII.13.2.5.2.5A.b of the Tariff.\n\n**2.1** **Input Review with Stakeholders**\n\nEach year in February or March, prior to the commencement of the fuel-security reliability review\nfor a FCA, the ISO will consult with the Reliability Committee regarding the inputs described in\nSection 3 below.\n\n**2.2** **ISO Notification of Fuel-Security Reliability Review Results to the Participant**\n\nThe results of the fuel-security reliability review will be quantified in an ISO issued determination\nnotification that is issued pursuant to Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.f of the Tariff.\n\n**2.3** **ISO Notification and Review of Determination with Stakeholders**\n\nThe ISO determinations described in Section III.13.2.5.2.5A.f will be reviewed with stakeholders, at\nthe Reliability Committee, in the same general timeframe that resources retained for transmission\nsecurity are reviewed, as outlined in PP-10, Section 7.6.\n\n**2.3.1 Informational Analysis Presentation**\n\nAn informational fuel-security reliability review with a 50/50 peak load forecast from the most\nrecent CELT will also be performed in all scenarios analyzed for units retained utilizing the 90/10\npeak load forecast, and included in with the materials described in this Section 2.3.  This analysis is\nnot used for unit retention determinations.\n\nFor the FCA 14 fuel-security reliability review cycle, an additional informational analysis will be\nperformed to simulate the impact of approximately 500 MW of offshore wind that is being\ndeveloped under a state procurement program with an in-service date for the winter under study,\nbut which has not yet received all required state approvals.\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**3.0** **Fuel-Security Reliability Review**\n\nThe fuel-security review consists of an hour-by-hour chronological simulation of the New England\nelectric supply systems for a winter period from the beginning of December through the end of\nFebruary. One of the key assumptions driving the results of the review is the amount of natural gas\navailable for electric generation.\n\n**Natural Gas Assessment**\n\nThe fuel-security reliability review models natural-gas consumption on a daily basis. The primary,\nindependent variable is average daily temperature converted to heating degree days (HDD). Given\na daily temperature, the total gas demand for Residential, Commercial and Industrial (RCI)\ncustomers is established based on updated gas demand reports and the sources for serving this gas\ndemand are based on the following:\n\n  - Gas from Pipelines – The first source utilized for natural gas comes from the pipeline supply\nencompassing Algonquin, Tennessee, Iroquois, and Portland Natural Gas Transmission\nSystem (PNGTS).\n\n  - Satellite Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) – On cold days (HDD), the model assumes that\ninjections from gas Local Distribution Company (LDC) satellite LNG storage facilities will be\nactivated in order to support the LDC behind-the-meter operations by increasing pressures\nand limiting draws from pipelines in accordance with their contractual agreements and\nsupply plans. An LNG injection curve shall be constructed from the implied satellite LNG\ninjections calculated for the past five winters using forecast LDC gas demand for the\nmodelled Capacity Commitment Period and actual non-power gas demand determined\nusing publicly available bulletin board data.\n\n  - Pipeline Connected LNG – Any remaining needs of the LDCs are supplied by large pipelineconnected LNG facilities such as Canaport, Distrigas and the Excelerate buoy.\n\nOnce the gas LDC demand (i.e., New England and New Brunswick gas demand) is served, the\nremaining amount of natural gas for electric generation – and its supply source – can be\ndetermined. If the gas LDC demand was ‘low,’ then pipeline gas may be available for electric\ngenerators. After the pipeline gas is fully utilized, the next source of gas for electric generation\nwould be from unused pipeline connected LNG facilities subject to the daily “cap” on LNG\nvaporization as addressed in Section B below. The maximum daily amount of gas available from\nboth classes of supply to the electric sector is then passed to the Electric Sector Dispatch Model.\n\n**Electric Sector Dispatch Model**\n\nThe maximum daily amount of natural gas available to the electric power sector is allocated to each\nhour using a heuristic algorithm to shape the available gas. The algorithm provides more gas during\nthe higher load hours and less gas to lower load hours with the goal of ensuring that all of the\navailable gas would be consumed each day before turning to other liquid fuel resources. Separate\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\naccounting is done for gas supply available from pipelines and gas supply available from pipeline\nconnected LNG facilities.\n\nThe amount of gas available from both sources in each hour is converted to available electric MWh\nin each hour assuming an average conversion efficiency of 7,400 Btu/kWh. This amount of MWhs\nfrom available gas is used by the dispatch algorithm where pipeline gas is used first and then\nresources using gas from vaporized LNG facilities are dispatched subsequently.\n\n**_Electric Sector Load_**\n\nThe New England electric loads used in the model are based on the loads and temperatures\nexperienced during the winter of 2014/15. All winter hourly loads are then scaled using the ratio of\nthe forecast 90/10 peak demand (net of Energy Efficiency) for the applicable future Capacity\nCommitment Period year to the observed peak in the historical benchmark year (2014/15).\n\n**_Reserves_**\n\nThirty-Minute Operating Reserves and Ten-Minute Operating Reserves are being served by the\ndistillate oil-only resources with the highest heat rates, which are the best suited to providing\nreserves.\n\n**_Resource Availability_**\n\nThe fuel-security model does not assume any scheduled outages. Random unavailability due to\nforced outages and derates is treated by “derating” the capacity of a resource by an Equivalent\nForced Outage Rate on Demand (EFORd) utilizing the ISO’s Generating Availability Data System\n(GADS) data as described below.\n\n**_Dispatch Order_**\n\nEnergy to serve the load comes from dispatching the resources in an economic order reflecting\nwinter conditions. Wind and Photovoltaics (PV) are dispatched first using profiles adjusted to\nreflect expected amounts of those resources as described in the Static Inputs below. Other\nrenewables such as wood, biomass and municipal solid waste are then assumed to be dispatched\nnext, followed by nuclear resources and then coal generators; the Seasonal Claimed Capability of\nthese resource technologies is derived from the most recent CELT report as described in the Static\nInputs below. Pumped storage and other electric storage resources are dispatched next using daily\nstorage profiles used to reflect the characteristic operation of each resource type by storing energy\nduring low load periods and generating energy during the higher load periods as described below in\nthe Static Inputs.\n\nNext, conventional hydro-electric generation is dispatched at an hourly profiled MW amount as\ndescribed in the Static Inputs below. This is followed by the dispatch of imports as a constant MW\nresource in accordance with assumptions set forth in Section A below.\n\nNext, the aggregate natural gas only resources are dispatched on pipeline gas in each hour, subject\nto the hourly availability of pipeline gas MWhs. If there is remaining pipeline gas, it is used by the\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\ngas-fired, dual-fueled, combined-cycle resources to serve remaining energy demands until the gas\nMWhs are exhausted.\n\nNext in the dispatch order are the natural-gas only resources that would be dispatched on pipelineconnected-LNG gas, subject to the hourly availability of pipeline-connected-LNG gas MWhs. If\nthere is remaining pipeline-connected-LNG gas, it is used by the gas-fired, dual-fueled, combinedcycle resources to serve remaining energy demands until the pipeline-connected-LNG gas MWhs\nare exhausted.\n\nIf more load still needs to be served, the dual-fueled combined cycle resources that have not been\npreviously dispatched on pipeline or pipeline-connected-LNG are dispatched on distillate oil,\nsubject to fuel in a specific generator’s associated oil tank as determined in Section A below.\n\nNext in the dispatch order are the distillate only generators not held for reserve and residual oil\ngenerators, subject to fuel in a specific generator’s oil tank determined in Section A below.\n\nLast, the dispatch of demand response resources will be applied to the unmet energy.\n\nAny remaining energy not served is then converted to MWhs of Operating Procedure – 4 Actions,\nTen-Minute Reserve Depletion and Operating Procedure – 7 Load Shed.\n\nThe following inputs will be used when performing the fuel-security reliability reviews.\n\n**A.** **STATIC INPUTS**\n\nA fuel-security reliability review will utilize the following static inputs:\n\n**i.** **Peak Load: This is calculated using the draft CELT Net 90/10 winter peak load values**\n(including the effects of energy efficiency) presented to the Planning Advisory Committee\n(PAC) during the spring of the year when the fuel security reliability review is performed,\nwhich is prior to the annual issuance of the final values in the CELT report released on May\n1.\n\n**ii.** **Winter Energy Profile: The hourly system demand from the 2014/2015 winter will be used**\nto create an hourly load shape by using the ratio of the CELT peak load for the relevant\nCapacity Commitment Period to the 2014/2015 winter peak load. The hourly temperature\nfrom the 2014/2015 winter will be used as the modeled hourly temperature.\n\n**iii.** **LDC Gas Demand: The LDC winter peak demand for the modeled Capacity Commitment**\nPeriod will be set annually based on vendor supplied information with growth for the\nmodeled period adjusted to not exceed the addition of any new gas supply capacity. The\nLDC winter peak demand shall be capped at the value utilized in the prior year’s fuel\nsecurity reliability review (i.e., for the prior Capacity Commitment Period). Both New\nEngland and New Brunswick LDC gas demand shall be accounted for in the modelling.\n\n**iv.** **Pipeline Capacity: Set for modeled Capacity Commitment Period based on vendor-supplied**\ninformation annually.\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**v.** **Satellite LNG facility vaporization: Set for modeled year based on vendor-supplied**\ninformation annually.\n\n**vi.** **Oil inventory levels: Tank inventory levels for oil-only resources and dual-fuel resources**\nthat operate primarily on oil during the winter shall be set to levels determined using the\n2017/2018 winter fuel surveys submitted to the ISO in December. Tank inventories then\nwill be assumed to be replenished with 202 barrels per hour when the reorder level is\nreached. The reorder level is provided using the results of the 2017/2018 winter fuel\nsurvey.\n\n**vii.** **Resource Seasonal Claim Capability:  The winter Seasonal Claimed Capability (MW) from**\nthe most recently published CELT report for all Existing Generating Capacity Resources\nqualified for the instant FCA and energy-only generators active in ISO New England markets.\nFor non-commercial Existing Generating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT report\nand energy-only generators that are in service but are not in the CELT report, the fuelsecurity reliability review will use the resource’s winter Qualified Capacity and the winter\nSCC value (as of the fifth business day in May), respectively.\n\n**viii.** **PV Forecast: For photovoltaic resources accounted for in the PV forecast, the fuel-security**\nreliability review will use draft CELT values as presented to the PAC during the spring of the\nyear when the fuel security reliability review is performed, which is prior to the annual\nissuance of the final values in the CELT report released on May 1. For in-service\nphotovoltaic resources not accounted for in the draft forecast values, the fuel-security\nreliability review will use the nameplate values. For non-commercial photovoltaic Existing\nGenerating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT report, the fuel-security reliability\nreview will use the nameplate equivalent of the resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation\nreceived in the most recent Forward Capacity Auction.\n\n**ix.** **Wind Resource Nameplate: For wind resources accounted for in the most recently**\navailable CELT report and in-service wind resources not accounted for in the most recently\navailable CELT report, the fuel-security reliability review will use the nameplate values. For\nnon-commercial wind Existing Generating Capacity Resources that are not in the CELT\nreport, the fuel-security reliability review will use the nameplate equivalent of the\nresource’s Capacity Supply Obligation received in the most recent Forward Capacity\nAuction.\n\n**x.** **Sun Profile: The ISO will use the observed hourly profile from the winter of 2014/2015,**\nadjusted to reflect the expected performance of the fleet assumed in service in the study\nyear, and updated annually.\n\n**xi.** **Onshore Wind Profile: The ISO will use the observed hourly profile from the winter of**\n2014/2015, adjusted to reflect the expected performance of the fleet assumed in service in\nthe study year, and updated annually.\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\n**xii.** **Offshore Wind Profile: The ISO will use an hourly profile reflecting the expected**\nperformance of the fleet assumed in service in the study year as though it had been in\noperation in the winter of 2014/2015, and updated annually.\n\n**xiii.** **Demand Response Resources: The winter Seasonal Claimed Capability (MW) reduction**\nvalue from active Demand Response Resources.\n\n**xiv.** **EFORd: The ISO calculated Equivalent Forced Outage Rate on Demand (EFORd) utilizing the**\nISO’s Generating Availability Data System (GADS) data. EFORd will be applied to Seasonal\nClaimed Capability, vii above, in the same manner it is applied for ICR and related values\ncalculations.\n\n**xv.** **OP-4 Action MW: Estimated hourly MW relief for each action of OP-4.**\n\n**xvi.** **Export Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids: Resource capacity associated with**\nExport Bids and Administrative Export De-List Bids qualified for the instant FCA will not be\nincluded as capacity available to ISO to meet internal New England load, and these bids will\nnot be modeled.\n\n**xvii.** **Pumped Storage and Other Electric Storage Devices: Set to levels using a daily storage**\nprofile that reflects the characteristic operation of the resource by storing energy during\nlow load periods and generating energy during the higher load periods.\n\n**xviii.** **Conventional Hydro-Electric Generation: This resource is dispatched at an hourly output**\nbased on the observed hourly profile from the winter of 2014/2015, adjusted to reflect the\nexpected performance of the fleet assumed in service in the study year, and updated\nannually.\n\n**B.** **VARIABLE INPUTS:**\n\nThe fuel-security reliability review will consider the following variable inputs:\n\n**i.** **Imports: Imports for this review will be defined as the total net flow across the NY-NE, NB-**\nNE and HQ-NE interfaces. The values are set at 2,800 MW, 3,000 MW, and 3,500 MW and\nwill be utilized in separate scenarios.\n\n**ii.** **LNG Injections: LNG injections for this review will be defined as the total LNG injected into**\nthe pipeline transmission system by the region’s three available LNG facilities, Canaport,\nDistrigas and Buoy. The values are set at 0.8 Bcf, 1.0 Bcf and 1.2 Bcf and will be utilized in\nseparate scenarios.\n\n**iii.** **Dual-Fuel resource tank inventory: For dual-fuel resources that operate primarily on**\nnatural gas during the winter, tank inventory for this review will be defined as a multiplier\nfor the onsite fuel-storage tank of the individual resource. The values are set at 1.25 and 2\nand will be utilized in separate scenarios. When the value is set to 1.25, the onsite available\nfuel for the individual resources will be set to 125% capacity of the individual resources’\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\ntanks at the start of the analysis. When the value is set to 2, the onsite available fuel for the\nindividual resources will be set to 200% capacity of the individual resources’ tanks at the\nstart of the analysis.\n\nThe variable inputs in this section can be changed based upon historical trends, new infrastructure,\nfuel surveys and as the ISO deems necessary, and the information will be provided to the Reliability\nCommittee in accordance with section 2 above.\n\n**C.** **SYSTEM MODEL STARTING POINT**\n\nWith the exception noted below, the model will include all new resources that have a binding and\nenforceable contract under a state procurement to be in-service by January 1 of the associated\nCapacity Commitment Period that, by the time the fuel-security reliability review is conducted,\nhave (i) submitted the certification described in Section 8.1.2 of PP10, pursuant to Section 4.1(f) of\nAttachment K to Part II of the Tariff, or (ii) demonstrated the contractual requirements through\nsubmittal of an order or other similar authorization from the appropriate state regulatory agency,\nalong with a copy of the contract, by five business days prior to the Existing Capacity Retirement\nDeadline. The model will take into consideration any obligation(s) to operate under these\ncontracts, or lack thereof, regarding energy deliveries specific to winter stress conditions being\nreviewed for fuel security.  With respect to (ii) above, the demonstration can be made by the state\nregulatory agency authorizing the contract, by a transmission company or electric distribution\ncompanies that is a counterparty to the contract, or by a third-party organization representing the\ninterests of the New England states regarding energy-related issues (e.g., NESCOE). For FCA 14,\noffshore wind resources shall have until April 23, 2019 to demonstrate the contractual\nrequirements stated above. If demonstration of the contractual requirements is received after\nApril 23, 2019, the ISO will make reasonable efforts to account for the resource in the model (e.g.,\nscenario analysis), to the extent that doing so will not interfere with the ability of the ISO to\ncomplete the analysis and issue its determination by 90 days after the Existing Capacity Retirement\nDeadline.\n\n**Table 1**\n\n**Timetable for ISO Notification to Include Resources in the Fuel Security Reliability Review**\n\n|Date|CCP13 2022-2023|CCP14 2023-2024|CCP15 2024-2025|Submission of Certification of Contractual Commitment from Resources Being Built in Accordance with Attachment K to the ISO*|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Receipt of FERC order for FCA 13||||Sep-15-18|\n|Feb-19|FCA|||Jan-15-19|\n\n\n-----\n\nForward Capacity Market\n\nFeb-20 FCA Apr-23-19\n\nJun-20 ARA1 Apr-15-20\n\nFeb-21 FCA Jan-15-20\n\nJun-21 ARA1 Apr-15-21\n\nAug-21 ARA2 Jun-15-21\n\nMar-22 ARA3 Jan-15-22\n\nJun-22 ARA1 Apr-15-22\n\nAug-22 ARA2 Jun-15-22\n\nMar-23 ARA3 Jan-15-23\n\nAug-23 ARA2 Apr-15-23\n\nMar-24 ARA3 Jan-15-24\n\n- If the notification to ISO indicates the contract for the resource is pending regulatory approval of\nthe state’s review, the ISO will require an update 5 business days prior to the auction or prior to\nthe retirement de-list bid deadline that the pending contracts have been approved.

Use OP-24C to determine if relay outages must be reported for the\n\ntransmission element.\n\n2. After determining that relay outages must be reported, consider the scheme.\n\nFor example, Figure 1 has System A and System B, each with its own\ncommunication channel.\n\n**_Figure 1 - Two Redundant Pilot Line Protection Schemes_**\n\n3. In Figure 1, two separate pilot line protection schemes (e.g. POTT, DCB,\n\nDUTT, Line Differential) are used along with a separate communication\nchannel for breaker failure transfer trip (BF TT). If one of the pilot line\nprotection schemes, either System A or System B is taken out-of-service, then\nthe answer to Question 4 should be “Yes”, the answer to Question 5 should\nalso be “Yes” and the answer to Question 6 should be “Yes” as long as BF TT\nremains in-service. If non-redundant breaker failure relay (BF) is removed\nfrom service, then the answer to Question 5 should be “No.” If BF TT were\nremoved from service, then the answer to Question 6 should be “No.”\n\n**_Figure 2 - Single Pilot Line Protection Scheme (Separate Transfer Trip Channel)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n4. In Figure 2, a single pilot line protection scheme is used along with a\n\nseparate communication channel for BF TT. If the pilot line protection\nscheme is taken out-of-service, then the answer to Question 4 should be\n“No,” the answer to Question 5 should also be “Yes” and the answer to\nQuestion 6 should be “Yes” as long as BF TT remains in-service.\n\n**_Figure 3 - Single Pilot Line Protection Scheme with Shared Transfer Trip Channel_**\n\n5. In Figure 3, a single pilot line protection scheme is applied with shared\n\ncommunications to transfer the trip signal to a remote breaker (BF TT). To\ncomplete Table 1 for this scheme with the communication removed from\nservice, the answers to both Questions 4 and 6 should be “No.” The answer\nto Question 5 should be “Yes.”\n\n6. In Figure 3, a non-redundant BF relay is taken out-of-service. The pilot line\n\nprotection scheme and the BF TT will not be impacted by that outage, so the\nanswers to Questions 4 and 6 should be “Yes”. The answer to Question 5\nshould be “No”. Note that a single BF relay out-of-service does not make the\nwhole BF TT scheme unavailable. Other local and remote breakers will key in\nthe trip signal to BF TT if needed. Hence, the answer to Question 6 should be\n“Yes.”.\n\n**_Figure 4 - Step Distance Relay_**\n\n\n-----\n\n7. In Figure 4, a step distance relay is employed with no BF TT. If the step\n\ndistance relay is removed from service, then the answers to Questions 4, 5\nand 6 should all be “N/A.”\n\n8. For bus or transformer differential relays taken out-of-service the answers to\n\nQuestions 4, 5 and 6 should all be “N/A.”\n\n9. The answer to Question 10 provides information to perform the steady-state\n\nanalysis. In order to properly simulate the stuck breaker contingency with BF\nrelay out-of-service, all elements tripped in this contingency must be listed. A\nsingle line-to-ground fault on either side of the stuck breaker with its BF relay\nout-of-service should be considered; such a fault will most likely require\nremote tripping of all transmission elements emanating from the substation.\n\n10. The answer to Question 8 confirms that the entity submitting the outage\n\napplication has appropriately coordinated scope of protection work with other\nentities operating other terminals of the same transmission facility. If the\ntransmission facility is owned by one entity, then no such coordination is\nrequired and the answer to Question 8 should be ‘N/A’.\n\n\n-----\n\n### OP-24, Appendix D Revision History\n\n|Rev.

In order to\nverify that MRRs are consistent with Generator Asset performance, ISO shall conduct\nMRR auditing by analyzing a Generator Asset’s historical response to electronic\ndispatch signals. Dispatches that are indicative of a Generator Asset’s response in a\ncertain initial output range shall be analyzed for MRR when the Generator Asset is\nrequired to increase MW output. This analysis shall take into account the statistical\nvariation of a Generator Asset’s response to dispatches, and includes a time-varying\nweighting factor for those dispatches to determine a probabilistic weighted average\nMRR for a Generator Asset, given an initial starting output. The ISO’s analysis is\ndescribed in Sections II and III of this Appendix.\n\n**II.** **DISPATCH INTERVAL CRITERIA**\n\n1. An electronic dispatch instruction to an on-line Generator Asset shall be referred to\n\nas a qualified dispatch interval (QDI) and utilized for MRR evaluation if all the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n\na. Generator Asset is dispatchable\n\nb. Current output is greater than or equal to Economic Min\n\nc. Desired Dispatch Point (DDP) is greater than current output\n\nd. DDP remains greater than current output for at least five minutes, and\n\ne. Change in DDP is greater than 5 times MRR or a defined percentage of the\n\nGenerator Asset’s dispatchable range (whichever is less). The defined\npercentage shall be based upon initial Generator Asset output as follows:\n\nBin # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nDDP change as 10 10 10 10 10 9 7 6 5 5\npercentage of\ndispatchable\nrange\n\nWhere each bin is 10% of the Generator Asset’s dispatchable range in MW\n\n2. A QDI shall end for a particular Dispatch Instruction when any of the following\n\nconditions are met:\n\na. Dispatch Instruction has been in effect for 15 minutes\n\nb. DDP minus Generator Asset output is less than 0.5% of Economic Max, or\n\nc. DDP is less than Generator Asset output\n\n3. A Dispatch Instruction that meets the above criteria may be removed from\n\nthe MRR analysis if that instruction was not indicative of normal MRR\nresponse. This may occur because of conditions such as, but not limited\n\n|Bin #|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|DDP change as percentage of dispatchable range|10|10|10|10|10|9|7|6|5|5|\n\n\n-----\n\nto, resource maintenance, outages, fuel switching, or manual dispatch.\n\n**III.** **CALCULATING MANUAL RESPONSE RATE**\n\n1. A QDI evaluation will produce an MRR as a ratio of the change in MW output to the\n\namount of time required to effect that change in minutes.\n\n2. The QDI and corresponding MRR value shall then be binned, based upon the\n\nGenerator Asset’s initial output, into one of ten equal MW bins across the\nGenerator Asset’s largest observed dispatchable range from Economic Min to\nEconomic Max.\n\n3. Statistical MRR outliers shall be removed from the analysis by removing the tails of\n\nthe statistical distribution using the mean value and standard deviation.\n\n_N_ _j_ _N_ _j_\n\n###### j  1  (R j i,  j )2,  j  1  R j i, N j i1 N j i1\n\n\nWhere:\n\n = mean value\n\n = standard deviation\n\nNj = number of samples in a MW range\nRj = set of ramp rates allocated to a MW range\nI= sample number\nj=MW bin number\n\nSamples that are within two standard deviations of the mean shall be retained\n\nso that retained samples satisfy: j 3 j  _Rj_  j  3 j\n\nWhere: 3 2.0\n\nResulting set of the ramp rates in the bin _j without outliers is_ _R_ _j_\n\nwith the number of samples _N_ _j_\n\n\n###### N\n\n\n4.

DAILY CYCLE HYDRO GENERATORS**\n\nCalculations will use daily mean river flow rate data over a 20-year historical period.\nThe flow duration data will be constructed from the most relevant United States\nGeological Survey (“USGS”) flow gage, with appropriate scaling to account for\ndifferences in drainage area. Ratings for such resources are established and\nupdated in calendar years that are evenly divisible by five. Capability will include the\neffects of natural stream flow, pondage, and eligible upstream storage. Details of\nthese capability calculations are contained in Section II of this Appendix.\n\nA non-Intermittent Power Resource daily cycle hydro asset summer Seasonal\nClaimed Capability (SCC) Audit value is calculated from the average of the four\nsummer monthly ratings (June - September), and the winter SCC Audit value is\ncalculated using the average of the eight winter monthly ratings (October - May).\n\nThe following variables must be defined prior to calculating the monthly capability.\nAll data must be provided by the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) except for flow\nand gage data, which will be provided by the ISO staff.\n\n**_Max. Capacity - power, in kW, produced when the Flow at Max. Capacity_**\npasses through the Generators at the station. Max. Capacity represents an\naverage value that properly takes into account typical differences in head\nexperienced under normal operating conditions.\n\n**Flow at Max. Capacity - the amount of water flow, in cubic feet per second (cfs),**\nrequired to produce the power specified in Max. Capacity.\n\n**_Conversion Factor - kilowatts of power produced at the station per cfs of flow._**\nThe default value of Conversion Factor is Max. Capacity / Flow at Max.\n**_Capacity, however, the Lead MP may supply an alternative value that is more_**\nrepresentative of typical operating conditions.\n\n**_Minimum Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, needed to support_**\npower production. Station power production is assumed to be zero whenever the\nflow is less than Minimum Flow.\n\n**_USGS Flow Gage - the most relevant USGS flow gage._**\n\n**_Flow at Gage - the amount of water flow, in cfs, at the gage that is surpassed_**\n50% of the time during the month, based on 20 years of flow data for the month.\nDaily cycle hydro capability calculations will use daily mean river flow rate data,\nover a 20-year historical period. The monthly flow rate used will be the 50[th]\npercentile value of the full set of daily mean values for that month over the\n20-year historical period (i.e., the value that is exceeded for 50% of the time\nduring the month). For example, for the month of June, the number of daily mean\nflow rate data points would be 20 (years) * 30 (days) = 600. These 600 daily\nmean flow rates for the month of June would be sorted, lowest to highest. The\nflow rate assumed for that month would be the 50[th] percentile value (value\nnumber 300 out of 600, i.e., 50% of the values are lower than this value and 50%\n\n\n-----\n\nof the values are higher than this value). The flow estimates will be updated in\ncalendar years that are evenly divisible by 5. ISO staff will provide this\ninformation.\n\n**_Gage Drainage Area - the stream natural drainage area, in square miles, at the_**\ngage. ISO staff will provide this information.\n\n**_Station Drainage Area - the stream natural drainage area, in square miles, at the_**\nstation.\n\n**_Unusable Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, required at all times_**\nthat is unavailable for generation, in order to maintain sufficient flow in a structure\nsuch as (but not limited to) a diversion canal. Leakage is also included in this\nfactor.\n\n**_Usable Flow - the minimum amount of water flow, in cfs, required at all times, but_**\nis available for generation during generation periods.\n\nFor Governance Participants claiming supplemental pond storage at the station, the\nfollowing must be provided:\n\n**_kWh in Full Pond - the energy produced, in kWh, if the water in the pond_**\nbetween maximum (full) and minimum pond elevation limits is used to generate at\n**_Max. Capacity without using any natural inflow. In effect, it is the electrical_**\nenergy equivalent of the pond. kWh in Full Pond is assumed to be Cubic Feet of\nUsable Pond * Conversion Factor / 3600.\n\nFor Governance Participants claiming supplemental upstream storage, the kWh in\n**_Upstream Pond is calculated in accordance with the Section II of this Appendix._**\n\n**_kWh in Upstream Pond - the amount of energy produced, in kWh, if the water in_**\nupstream storage is used to generate power of the amount in Max. Capacity at\nthe lower station without using any natural flow. In effect, it is the electrical\nenergy equivalent of the upstream storage. This model will create an equivalent\npond at the station for the upstream storage.\n\nThe following are calculations that will be used during the station evaluation:\n\n**NOTE**\n\n**x = y means x is assigned the value y**\n\n**_Monthly Capability - the monthly station rating, in kW, which will ultimately be_**\ndetermined by this process.\n\n**_Test Hours - the number of hours simulated as a demonstration test period. The_**\ndemonstration test period is two hours for Winter Period months (i.e., October May), and four hours for Summer Period months (i.e., June - September).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Flow at Station - the amount of monthly water flow at the station, in cfs, which is_**\nsurpassed 50% of the time during the month.\n\n_Flow at Station = Flow at Gage * Station Drainage Area / Gage Drainage_\nArea.\n\n**_Hours in Full Pond - hours of generation available from a full pond without use_**\nof natural flow when generating at Max. Capacity. Hours in Full Pond\nrepresents the usable water between maximum (full) pond and minimum pond\nelevation requirements.\n\n**_Hours in Full Pond = kWh in Full Pond / Max. Capacity_**\n\n**_Hours in Upstream Pond - hours of generation available from upstream storage_**\nwithout use of natural flow when generating at Max. Capacity.\n\n**_Hours in Upstream Pond = kWh in Upstream Pond / Max. Capacity_**\n\nThe following steps are repeated for each month to determine capability for daily\ncycle hydro generating stations:\n\na. Assign the station maximum capability if the natural monthly water flow at the\n\nstation is greater than what the station requires at maximum generation. If the\nstation meets this criterion, no further evaluation is needed.\n\nIf Flow at Station > (Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow)\n\nThen Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity\n\nIf Flow at Station < (Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow)\n\nThen proceed to (b.)\n\nb. If step (a.) determined there is insufficient natural monthly water flow at the\n\nstation, the natural water flow shortage needs to be determined.\n\n**_Natural Flow Shortage = Flow at Max. Capacity + Unusable Flow -_**\n**_Flow at Station_**\n\nIf pond storage is claimed, go to step c.\n\nIf pond storage is not claimed, but upstream storage is claimed, go to step e.\n\nIf neither pond storage nor upstream storage is claimed, go to step h.\n\nc. Since the station has insufficient monthly natural water flow for Max.\n\n**_Capacity, and there is a pond at the station, the number of hours that the_**\npond will supplement the natural monthly water flow needs to be determined.\nIt is assumed that the station will generate at maximum output while the pond\nis supplementing the natural water flow.\n\n**_Hours of Supplementary Pond = (Hours in Full Pond * Flow at Max._**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Capacity / Natural Flow Shortage)_**\n\nd. If the number of hours that the pond supplements the natural monthly water\n\nflow is greater than the test period, assign the station maximum capability\nprovided that the monthly natural water flow will refill the pond for a\ndemonstration the same time on the following day.\n\nIf Hours of Supplementary Pond > Test Hours\n\nThen, Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity\n\nand go to step i to perform a refill check.\n\nIf pond supplement is insufficient for Max. Capacity, and upstream storage is\nclaimed, go to e.\n\nIf pond supplement is insufficient for Max. Capacity and upstream storage is not\nclaimed, go to h.\n\ne. The station has insufficient natural water flow, and insufficient (or no) pond\n\nstorage, and the station has upstream water storage. This algorithm simplifies\nupstream storage by modeling it as an extension of the pond at the station.\nThe variable kWh in Upstream Pond contains constraints related to the\noutput of the upstream storage, and transit time.\n\n**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = Hours in Upstream_**\n**_Pond * Flow at Max. Capacity / Natural Flow Shortage_**\n\nf. Constrain the Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage so that it only\n\nprovides energy after the pond at the station is depleted.\n\nIf Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage > Test Hours - Hours of\n**_Supplementary Pond_**\n\nThen Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = Test Hours **_Hours of Supplementary Pond_**\n\ng. The station will be at maximum capability if the pond and upstream storage\n\nsupplement the natural monthly water flow for the entire test period.\n\nIf (Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary\n**_Upstream Storage) = Test Hours_**\n\nThen Monthly Capability = Max. Capacity\n\nand go to step i to perform a refill check.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf this step is reached, maximum generation cannot be sustained throughout\nthe simulated test period. The generation will be computed in three (3) parts:\n\nh.\n\n   - Generation that is produced by:\n\n      - natural flow,\n\n      - the pond, and\n\n      - upstream storage.\n\nDiagram 1 shows what each part of the calculation represents:\n\nDiagram 1: Time Profile of Station Output\n\nThe calculations for each are:\n\nNatural Flow:\n\nCase 1: (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) > Minimum Flow\nGeneration = (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) * Test Hours *\n**_Conversion Factor_**\n\nCase 2: (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) < Minimum Flow\nGeneration = (Flow at Station - Unusable Flow) * (Hours of\n**_Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage) *_**\n**_Conversion Factor_**\n\nPond Supplement:\n\nIt is assumed that the station generates at Max. Capacity.\nGeneration = Hours of Supplementary Pond * Natural Flow Shortage\n\n   - Conversion Factor\n\nUpstream Storage:\n\nIt is assumed that the station generates at Max. Capacity.\n\n\n-----\n\nGeneration = Hours of Supplementary **_Upstream Storage * Natural_**\n**_Flow Shortage * Conversion Factor_**\n\nThe Monthly Capability rating is then determined as the sum of the\nenergies derived from each source divided by the number of hours in the\ntest.\n\n**_Monthly Capability = (Natural Flow Generation + Pond Supplement_**\nGeneration + Upstream Storage Generation) / Test Hours.\n\ni. Upon reaching this refill check step, the Monthly Capability is correct,\n\nprovided that the pond and upstream storage used can be refilled by natural\nflow if the same test was repeated on the same hour of the following day. For\nsimplicity, it is assumed that the same natural flow will refill both the pond and\nupstream storage.\n\nThe refill check assumes that minimum possible water use occurs in between\nsimulated test periods. The total outflow of water passing through and around\nthe station is calculated:\n\n**_OutFlow = (Test Hours *Flow at Station) + (Natural Flow Shortage*_**\n(Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours of Supplementary Upstream\n**_Storage)) + ((24 - Test Hours) * (Unusable Flow + Usable Flow))_**\n\n(Test Hours *Flow at Station) represents the water passing through\nthe generator station during the test.\n\n(Natural Flow Shortage * (Hours of Supplementary Pond + Hours\n**_of Supplementary Upstream Storage))_** represents the supplemental\npondage and upstream storage used during the test period.\n\n((24 - Test Hours) * (Unusable Flow + Usable Flow)) represents the\nwater which must pass the station in between test periods on\nsuccessive days.\n\nj. If OutFlow does not exceed the natural inflow during a day (24 * Flow at\n\n**_Station), then the Monthly Capability previously calculated is correct. If_**\n**_OutFlow exceeds the daily inflow, then the Monthly Capability is scaled_**\ndownward to honor the refill requirement as follows:\n\n**_Monthly Capability = Monthly Capability * (24 * Flow at Station) /_**\n**_OutFlow_**\n\nk. The SCCs are calculated as follows:\n\nSummer SCC = Average of four summer Monthly Capabilities (June –\nSeptember)\n\nWinter SCC = Average of eight winter Monthly Capabilities (October –\nMay)\n\n\n-----\n\n**II. UPSTREAM STORAGE MODEL**\n\nThe upstream storage model is a “no spill” model, which assumes that all ponds in\nthe river system are full at the start of the modeling period. It models a “slug” of\nwater being released and moving downstream. By the time the slug of water moves\ndownstream to reach the facility being rated, the flow rate is assumed to be equal to\nthe smallest flow for maximum generation among all intermediary generators\nincluding the upstream facility whose contribution is being computed.\n\nThe model computes a contribution from each upstream storage facility for each 30minute interval within the test period. These contributions include the flow limitations\nin the river system as described above, the flow to achieve maximum generation at\nthe station being rated, the hours of storage in the upstream pond for the upstream\nfacilities, and the transit times to the station being rated.\n\nFirst, each upstream generator contribution is determined in each 30-minute interval\nassuming an infinite pond size at the upstream storage facility. Then the cumulative\nunconstrained energy from the upstream facility is computed as the test period\nprogresses. Then, an energy limit is computed for each upstream facility based on\nthe hours of storage in the upstream pond when the upstream station generates at\nmaximum, the transit time to the station being rated, the flow for maximum\ngeneration at the station being rated, and the maximum generation at the station\nbeing rated.\n\nThe cumulative energy delivery from an upstream storage facility to the station being\nrated with a 30-minute resolution is then constrained by the effective energy limit for\nthe upstream storage energy ultimately produced at the station being rated.\n\nContributions in each 30-minute interval from relevant upstream storage facilities are\nthen summed, and the kWh of effective upstream storage is ultimately computed.\n\nA. Required Information\n\nThe following information must be provided for the station being rated:\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station - the output of the station being rated, in_**\nkW, corresponding to the maximum flow.\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station - the output of the station being rated, in_**\nkW, corresponding to the maximum flow.\n\nThe following information is needed for each upstream facility:\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility - power, in kW, produced when the_**\n**_Flow at Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility passes through the_**\ngenerators at the upstream station.\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility represents an average value that_**\nproperly takes into account typical differences in head experienced under\nnormal operating conditions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_kWh in Upstream Storage Facility - the amount of energy produced, in_**\nkWh, if the water in upstream storage is used to generate power at the\nupstream facility of the amount specified in Max. Capacity of the\n**_Upstream Facility without using any natural flow._**\n\n**_Flow at Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility - the amount of water flow,_**\nin cfs, required to produce the power specified in Max. Capacity of\n**_Upstream Facility._**\n\n**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage - the hours for which the_**\npond of the upstream facility can sustain full output without any natural\nflow. This is used to ensure that the energy limitations of the upstream\nstorage facility are respected within the methodology.\n\n**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage = kWh in Upstream_**\n**_Storage Facility / Max. Capacity of Upstream Facility_**\n\n**_Transit Time - The time, in hours, required for water from the upstream_**\nstorage facility to reach the pond of the station being evaluated. In order\nto simulate simultaneous requests for maximum generation for the same\npeaking period, upstream storage is assumed to be unavailable for\ngeneration for the station being studied until the Transit Time expires. An\nupstream pond cannot supplement the station being examined if Transit\n**_Time is greater than Test Hours._**\n\n**_Test Hours - the number of hours simulated as a demonstration test_**\nperiod.\n\n**_Minimum Flow at Max. Capacity - when computing the kWh available to_**\nthe station being rated from an upstream storage facility, Minimum Flow\n**_at Max. Capacity is the smallest value found among the flows for_**\nmaximum capacity for the upstream storage facility being evaluated for its\ncontribution and that of any intermediary stations. This is the means by\nwhich the no-spill requirement of the model is enforced.\n\nB. Calculations\n\n1. **Compute the contribution from each upstream facility in each 30-**\n\n**minute interval of the test period. The contribution is set to zero if the**\n30-minute interval is such that the slug of water being modeled will not\narrive during the interval due to the Transit Time. If the transit time is\nsuch that there is some overlap with the interval, then for simplicity it is\nassumed that the slug of water is fully available in the interval. For\nexample, a transit time of 59 minutes renders that upstream storage\nunavailable for the first 30-minute interval, and then fully available during\nsubsequent intervals. When the upstream storage is available to provide\nenergy in a 30-minute interval, its energy is computed by multiplying the\nmaximum capacity of the station being rated by the ratio of the most\nrestrictive maximum flow in the path from the upstream storage to the flow\n\n\n-----\n\nfor maximum output at the station being rated. This energy is constrained\nby the maximum capacity of the station being rated. These calculations\ndo not include any energy limitations of the upstream storage.\n\n**_Kilowatt-Half Hours from Upstream Pond =_**\n\n**_Lesser of_**\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station * (Minimum Flow at Max._**\n**_Capacity_** **_/ Flow at Max. Capacity of Rated Station)_**\n\n**_And_**\n\n**_Max. Capacity of Rated Station_**\n\n2. **Compute cumulative energy for each upstream storage facility. For**\n\neach 30-minute interval, compute the cumulative energy that would be\ndelivered from the upstream storage as if it had an infinite pond size, as\ntime progresses through the test period.\n\n3. **Determine energy limit for each upstream storage facility. Categorize**\n\nthe energy limit determination into one of four mutually exclusive\nscenarios. The energy limit is computed based on rules applicable to\neach scenario.\n\n**_Scenario A applies when the most constraining upstream flow for the_**\nupstream facility exceeds or equals the flow for maximum generation\nat the station being rated, and this condition will persist from the time\nthe transit time expires until the test period expires. In Scenario A, the\nenergy limit equals\n\n**_Energy Limit A = Max.

This scenario\nrecognizes that the water arriving at the station being rated from the\nupstream facility in excess of that needed for maximum generation at\nthe station being rated will be “ponded” at the station for use after the\ninflow from upstream storage goes to zero. Full output at the station\nbeing rated is assumed for the lesser of these two periods:\n\n**_Time B =_**\n\n**_Lesser of_**\n\n**_Test Hours_** **_– Transit Time_**\n\n**_And_**\n\n**_Hours of Supplementary Upstream Storage + (Hours of_**\n**_Supplementary Upstream Storage * ((Minimum Flow at Max._**\n**_Capacity – Flow at Max.

Apply the energy limits**\n\nby comparing the cumulative unconstrained (from a total upstream storage\nenergy perspective) initial energy assignments with the applicable energy\nlimit from the upstream storage. The initial energy assignment is\nunaltered if the energy limit has not been met. However, if the cumulative\nenergy in the 30-minute interval surpasses the energy limit, then the initial\nenergy assignment is reduced sufficiently to honor the energy constraint.\n\n5. **Sum up the contributions within each 30-minute interval from each**\n\n**upstream facility in the model. The sum of the contributions in each 30-**\nminute interval is capped by the maximum capacity of the station being\nrated.\n\n6. **Determine the kWh in Upstream Pond for use in calculations. Sum**\n\nup the capped energy values in each 30-minute interval, multiplying by\ntwo to convert kW-half hours to kWh, to determine the usable upstream\nstorage.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nUpstream ponds without generators can be used by determining the hours of\nsupplemental upstream storage at the maximum allowable outlet flow and by using\nthat maximum allowable outlet flow in determining the Minimum Flow at Max\nCapacity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.

Two or more Assets in a single station or two or more stations, or portions of\n\ncombined-cycle generating stations modeled as multiple Assets, whose capability is\nlimited by common elements and/or commonly assigned staffing should establish\ncapability based on simultaneous CCAs.\n\nB. Common elements include but are not limited to:\n\n    - Staffing;\n\n   - Steam headers;\n\n    - Stacks and other boiler auxiliaries;\n\n   - Condenser cooling equipment (spray modules, pumps, screens, inlets, discharge\n\ncanals, cooling tower, etc.); and\n\n   - Common river flow or watershed.\n\nC. The capability of the individual common elements associated with a group of stations\n\nor Assets should be established recognizing the impact of each element on the\ncapability of the entire group.\n\nD. Normal station service and unit auxiliaries (such as spray modules, cooling towers, or\n\nother auxiliaries required by regulatory or governmental authority) should be in use\nduring the period when a CCA is conducted. Market Participants (MPs) may use\ndiscretion when estimating station service for small (less than five (5) MW), unstaffed\nhydro and/or internal combustion stations where station service is not accurately\nmetered and/or recorded on an hourly basis.\n\nE. Multi-Generator stations must self-certify for the individual Generator Assets of the\n\nstation that the SCC of the Generator Assets at this station are not limited in any way\nby common elements, commonly assigned staffing or any other factors. This\ncertification is provided by submitting the form found in Appendix E of this Operating\nProcedure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II. INDIVIDUAL ASSET TYPES**\n\nA. In addition to requirements listed in Section I of this Appendix, the following\n\nrequirements, applicable to specific generator types, will govern capability\ndetermination:\n\n1. Steam Turbine Assets With No Steam Exports\n\n**No adjustments for atmospheric and/or water temperatures, other than those**\nspecified in Section III.1.5.1.4 of Market Rule 1, will be made.\n\n2. Steam Turbine Assets, Combined Cycle Assets, or Pseudo-Combined Cycle\n\nAssets with Steam Exports\n\na. In instances where steam is exported for uses external to the electric power\n\nfacility, an adjustment must be made to the MW output demonstrated during a\nCCA in order to normalize the SCC for steam exports by adjusting for the\ndifference between actual steam exports and “normal” steam exports. It is\nexpected that when a CCA is conducted or when the Asset is being\ndispatched “in merit” based on its Supply Offer profile (which should be\nconsistent with and reflective of its contractual arrangements), the steam\nexports of the facility will be managed so as to demonstrate the full level of\ncontrol by the facility operators over steam export rates, which is permitted by\ncontract so as to maximize electric output.\n\nb. All Generator Assets with one or more steam turbines must self-certify that the\n\nGenerator Assets do not have steam exported for uses external to the electric\npower facility that may affect the SCC, by submitting Appendix F of this\nprocedure to ISO.\n\n1) In order to make the adjustment for steam exports, the Lead MP or its\n\nagent, shall provide:\n\ni. Statements of its Seasonal Claimed Capability Steam Demand\n\n(SCCSD) for both the Winter and Summer Claimed Capability\nPeriods. The SCCSD for each seasonal period is the expected\n(average) steam export during OP-4 or on-peak hours and is\ndetermined as follows:\n\na) _Fully Interruptible. If steam exports can be fully interrupted at the_\n\ndirection of the Lead MP or its agent pursuant to dispatch orders\nof the ISO based on the Asset’s Supply Offer profile or during any\nand all actions of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4)., the SCCSD shall be\nequal to zero.\n\nb) _Fixed Amount Interruptible. If steam exports can be partially_\n\ncurtailed at the direction of the Lead MP or its agent pursuant to\ndispatch orders of ISO based on the Asset Supply Offer profile or\nduring any and all actions of OP-4, the SCCSD shall be equal to\nthe average steam export rate during the on-peak hours of the\n\n\n-----\n\nSCC Period which actually occurred during the immediately prior\nlike period less the volume or proportion of steam which can be\ncurtailed based on the Asset Supply Offer profile or during any and\nall actions of OP-4.\n\nc) _Uninterruptible. If steam exports cannot be curtailed at the_\n\ndirection of the Lead MP or its agent, the SCCSD shall be equal to\nthe average steam export rate during the on-peak hours of the\nSCC Period that actually occurred during the immediately prior like\nperiod.\n\nii. For a new Asset, if actual average steam export data is not available,\n\nthe Lead MP will provide ISO with its best reasonable estimate of\nsteam exports for each SCC period, consistent with the degree to\nwhich steam exports can be interrupted, as described above\n\niii. A table is to be provided with the appropriate Asset Registration\n\nForm, showing output at various steam export levels (or, for combined\ncycle or pseudo-combined cycle Assets, output at various steam\nexport and temperature levels). This steam-temperature-output table\nwould include expected output at the respective Seasonal (summer\nand winter) Claimed Capability Steam Demand and, if applicable,\nrespective seasonal (90°F-summer and 20°F-winter) criterion\ntemperatures. (The same requirements on temperature adjustments\nprovided in III.1.5.1.1(c) of the Tariff should be followed). This table\nmust include the full range of possible steam exports, in increments of\n5,000 lbs/hr (and temperatures, if applicable) associated with the full\nrange of possible MW output levels of the facility. (If necessary,\nincrements of other than 5,000 lbs/hr may be provided). An abridged\nexample of such a table, which also provides for the submittal of\nSCCSD and Interruptible Steam Export (ISE) data is shown in Table\n1.\n\n2) ISE for both the Winter and Summer Claimed Capability Periods, is the\n\namount of steam demand contractually available during OP-4, CCAs, and\nas offered economically. ISE, for each seasonal period, is the amount that\nis available to be interrupted, while SCCSD is the expected amount of\nsteam export after exports are interrupted. For example, if steam exports\nare normally 50,000 lbs/hr and are fully interruptible, then ISE = 50,000\nand SCCSD = 0.\n\n3) Within seven business days after a CCA is conducted on an Asset for\n\nwhich adjustments must be made for steam exports, the Lead MP or its\nagent will provide ISO with information on the average steam export rate\nthat occurred during the period of the CCA, including:\n```\n  o Actual Steam Export (ASEP) during the hour just prior to the initiation of\n\n```\na CCA\n```\n  o Average Actual Steam Export (AASED) during the period of the CCA.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n|TABLE 1: TEMPERATURE-STEAM PERFORMANCE (MW) TABLE (EXAMPLE) Process Seam Flow (lbs/hr)|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Temperature (degrees, Fahrenheit)|0|5,000|10,000|15,000|45,000|50,000|\n|0|66.380|66.030|65.680|65.330|63.230|62.880|\n|1|66.098|65.748|65.398|65.048|62.714|62.209|\n|2|65.815|65.465|65.115|64.765|62.199|61.538|\n|3|65.533|65.183|64.833|64.483|61.683|60.866|\n\n\n4) ISO will obtain the data for the Demonstrated Capability, Unadjusted\n\n(DCU), and, for combined cycle Assets, adjust the DCU for the combined\nsteam and combustion turbine components to criterion temperature to\nderive the Demonstrated Capability Adjusted for Temperature (DCAT); for\nsteam turbine Assets, DCAT is equal to DCU. ISO will then use steam\nexport information to normalize the output demonstrated for steam exports\nto derive the Demonstrated Capability Adjusted for Temperature and\nSteam Exports (DCATSE).\n\n5) The following examples illustrate how DCATSE will be derived in different\n\nsituations:\n\n_Example 1 - Assets with no interruptible steam sales (i.e., ISE = 0)_\n\nIn this example, the normalization process adjusts for the difference\nbetween AASED and SCCSD as follows:\n\nDCATSE = DCAT + (MW@SCCSD – MW@AASED)\n\nWhere:\n\nMW@SCCSD = the expected output indicated by the steamtemperature-output table at the criterion temperature and SCCSD;\nand\n\nMW@AASED = the expected output indicated by the steamtemperature-output table at criterion temperature and the Actual\nAverage Steam Export during the period of the CCA.\n\n_Example 2 - Assets for which steam sales are fully interruptible_\n\nIn this example, the steam exports are supposed to be interrupted during a\nCCA or when the Asset is dispatched to its Eco Max in economic merit\norder based on the Asset Supply Offers which should be consistent and\nreflective of its contractual arrangements. Therefore, AASED should be\n\n\n-----\n\nequal to SCCSD. If steam exports are not interrupted, the CCA result will\nreflect the failure to interrupt. In this example, there is no adjustment for\nsteam exports to be made:\n\nDCATSE = DCAT\n\n_Example 3 - Assets for which a fixed quantity of export steam is_\ninterruptible\n\nIn this example, the normalization process adjusts for the difference\nbetween AASED and SCCSD (as in Example 1), but no credit is given for\nfailures to interrupt. In this example, the adjustment is as follows:\n\nDCATSE = DCAT + MW@SCCSD – MW@AASED - [MW@SCCSD –\nMW@(SCCSD + ISE – (ASEP – AASED)] = DCAT + [MW@(SCCSD +\nISE – (ASEP – AASED)] – MW@AASED\n\nWhere:\n\nMW@SCCSD is defined as in Example 1;\nMW@AASED is defined as in Example 1; and\nMW@(SCCSD + ISE – (ASEP – AASED) = the expected output\nindicated by the steam-temperature-output table at the criterion\ntemperature and a steam export reference point which is equal to\nthe SCCSD adjusted to reflect the difference between the claimed\nISE amount and the amount which was actually interrupted during\nthe CCA where such amount is equal to the difference between the\nASEP and the AASED.\n\nThe following examples in Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the steam export\nadjustment calculations.\n\n\n-----\n\n|TABLE 2: STEAM ADJUSTMENT EXAMPLES ASSUMING STEAM EXTRACTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT REDUCES OUTPUT|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Steam Export (lbs/hr)|50,000|40,000|30,000|20,000|10,000|0||\n||Output (MW)|240|243|245|247|249|250||\n||||||||||\n|Steam Export -|SCC|DCAT|SCCSD|ISE|ASEP|AASED|DCATSE|Result|\n||(MW)|(MW)|(lbs/hr)|(lbs/hr)|(lbs/hr)|(lbs/hr)|(MW)||\n|Uninterruptible|240|245|50,000|0|30,000|30,000|240|pass|\n||240|240|50,000|0|30,000|30,000|235|fail|\n||247|245|20,000|0|30,000|30,000|247|pass|\n||||||||||\n|Fully Interruptible|250|250|0|50,000|50,000|0|250|pass|\n||250|240|0|50,000|50,000|50,000|240|fail|\n||250|243|0|50,000|50,000|50,000|243|fail|\n||250|243|0|50,000|50,000|40,000|243|fail|\n||250|243|0|50,000|50,000|10,000|243|fail|\n||||||||||\n|Fixed Amount Interruptible|245|245|30,000|20,000|50,000|30,000|245|pass|\n||245|240|30,000|20,000|50,000|50,000|240|fail|\n||249|243|10,000|20,000|50,000|40,000|247|fail|\n||245|245|30,000|20,000|40,000|20,000|243|fail|\n||245|240|30,000|20,000|40,000|20,000|238|fail|\n||||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n|TABLE 3: STEAM ADJUSTMENT EXAMPLES ASSUMING STEAM EXPORTS INCREASE OUTPUT (TOPPING CYCLE – STEAM IS USED TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY FIRST AND THEN EXTRACTED AFTER THE STEAM TURBINE)|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Steam Export (lbs/hr)|50,000|40,000|30,000|20,000|10,000|0||\n||Output (MW)|250|249|247|245|243|240||\n||||||||||\n|Steam Export|SCC|DCAT|SCCSD|ISE|ASEP|AASED|DCATSE|Result|\n||(MW)|(MW)|(lbs/hr)|(MW)|(lbs/hr)|(lbs/hr)|(MW)||\n|Uninterruptible|250|250|50,000|0|50,000|50,000|250|pass|\n||247|250|30,000|0|50,000|50,000|247|pass|\n||250|247|50,000|0|30,000|30,000|250|pass|\n||250|247|50,000|0|30,000|30,000|250|pass|\n||250|242|50,000|0|30,000|30,000|245|fail|\n||||||||||\n\n\nc. Gas Turbine, Combined Cycle, and Pseudo-Combined Cycle Assets with No\n\nSteam Exports\n\n1) Additional data that must be submitted to the ISO with the Asset\n\nregistration include a table reflecting the full range (100°F - 0°F, in one\ndegree increments) of temperature versus MW output for the Asset. Such\ntables must be reflective of the Asset characteristics and claimed\ncapabilities reflected during initial registration and any subsequent revision\nsubmittal.) Specifically:\n\n   - The table may be referred to as the Assets temperature curve and\n\ntypically is non-linear by nature showing the degradation of output as\nthe ambient (or inlet) temperature increases. This curve should be an\naccurate depiction of the Assets output at every ambient temperature\ndegree increment.\n\n   - The output value associated with the 90°F temperature must equal the\n\ninitial summer SCC;\n\n   - The output value associated with the 20°F temperature must equal the\n\ninitial winter SCC; and\n\n    - All other MW output values must be consistent with those associated\n\nwith the 90°F and 20°F values.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Pumped Storage Hydro Assets\n\na. At the time of initial commercial operation for a station and/or Asset, a CCA\n\ndemonstration shall be conducted as a station.\n\nb. Pumped storage stations that, due to a net head reduction, experience a\n\ncontinuous downward trend in capability exceeding an average of one (1)\npercent per hour during the first four (4) hours of the commercial operation or\nsubsequent station CCA demonstrations, should base the ratings on a station\ndemonstration rather than individual Asset’s demonstration. Asset CCA\ndemonstration requests to establish a higher Claimed Capability Rating shall\nrequire a station CCA demonstration.\n\nc. CCA demonstration requests to restore the capability of a single Asset, or a\n\nsubset of Assets at the station, may be performed individually as long as the\nresulting capability of the station is less than or equal to the total SCC for the\nstation that had previously been claimed over the past two (2) similar\ncapability periods and no previous station demonstrations experienced a\ndownward trend in capability exceeding an average of one (1) percent per\nhour.\n\nd. SCC should be established that ensures that the total Energy content of the\n\nupper reservoir is sufficient to sustain SCC for four (4) hours and that the\nupper reservoir can be restored to provide the SCC for that duration during\nfive (5) successive weekdays.\n\ne. Stations operated on a weekly draw-down cycle should determine SCC based\n\non a station upper reservoir Energy content being no greater at the completion\nof the CCA than 75% of the maximum Energy content when the upper\nreservoir is full.\n\n4. Conventional Hydro Generators - Weekly\n\na. Stations may be considered as operated on a weekly draw-down cycle\n\nprovided there is on-site Energy storage between normal operating elevations\nequivalent to at least ten (10) times SCC, assuming zero inflow from natural\nrun-off and upstream station water discharge. Otherwise, stations will be\nconsidered as operated on a daily cycle.\n\nb. Capability should be determined based on:\n\n    - A station CCA demonstration (with all Assets within the station operating)\n\nrather than individual Asset CCA demonstrations conducted at different\ntimes.\n\nc. SCC should be determined based on the stations normal or typical net head at\n\nmid-week or mid-season.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III. OP-23 Appendix B Revision History**\n\n|Rev.

Protection System Components do not include equipment such as fault\nrecorders and meters that do not directly affect protection operation.\n\nDefined terms used but not defined in this OP shall have the meaning ascribed to\nthem in the ISO New England Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff or the\nGlossary of Terms Used in North American Electric Reliability Corporation Inc.\n(NERC) Reliability Standards or the Northeast Power Coordinating Council, Inc.\n(NPCC) Glossary of Terms.\n\n\n-----\n\n### II. Purpose\n\nThis OP establishes requirements for entities that own transmission or generation\nequipment to provide protective relay information to the ISO for the collaborative study\nof Protection System Components and protection systems, including Remedial Action\nSchemes (RAS) and Automatic Control Schemes (ACS) that protect transmission and\ngeneration elements of the Bulk Electric System (BES). It also includes requirements\nfor equipment owners to coordinate protection equipment and relay settings. Lead\nMarket Participants (Lead MPs) for Generator Owners (GOs) shall provide protective\ndevice characteristics to the ISO with the understanding that these settings are used\nfor the ISO’s reliability studies and system coordination.\n\nThis OP requires that, as appropriate, Transmission Owners (TOs), GOs, Generator\nOperators (GOPs), and Lead MPs for GOs:\n\n     - Collaborate or coordinate, as needed, regarding information necessary for\n\nprotection system characteristic reviews, and coordinate with other entities for\nnew protection systems, modifications to existing protection systems, or\nchanges in transmission system topology that necessitate changes in protection\nsystems. See Sections III and VI or further details regarding coordination and\nprotection characteristics.\n\n     - For applicable facilities listed in Section IV, notify LCCs immediately after\n\nconfirming Protection System Component failure or Degradation as described in\nSection V.A.\n\n     - For applicable facilities listed in Section IV, provide information to the ISO\n\nregarding planned Protection System Component outages for protection system\nchanges, testing or maintenance. Planned outage requests are described in\nSection V.B.\n\n     - Provide information to the ISO prior to making any changes to protection\n\ncharacteristics for the protection of selected transmission or generation\nequipment, except changes that do not significantly impact relay reach or\nclearing times. This is detailed in Section VI.\n\n     - Provide an annual certification that the protection system characteristics as\n\nprovided pursuant to this OP have been maintained throughout the year and\nremain accurate.\n\nThe ISO uses the information provided pursuant to this OP to calculate system limits\nsuch as operating and planning stability limits, determine generation dispatch limits, as\nwell as to further plan and operate the system in a reliable manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n### III. Coordination Between Entities for Protection Systems\n\nIn order to meet its responsibilities as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), Transmission\nOperator (TOP), Planning Coordinator (PC), and Transmission Planner (TP), the\nISO’s role in determining protection system performance (including RAS and ACS\nperformance) focuses on the following areas:\n\n     - Maintaining awareness of the operational status of protection systems, the\n\ncorrect operation of which is relied upon to maintain system reliability\n\n     - Obtaining the data needed to properly model the actions of protection systems\n\nfor system simulations\n\n     - Reviewing the impacts of proposed new or modified protection systems on the\n\nperformance of the New England Transmission System\n\nTOs, TOPs, GOs, and GOPs shall collaborate and, when necessary, coordinate the\ndesign, construction, and commissioning of any new or modified protection system\nwith the owners and operators of all other affected facilities. TOs and GOs shall\ncomply with the requirements related to protection systems included in\ninterconnection agreements with other entities. In addition, TOs, TOPs, GOs, and\nGOPs shall collaborate when changes in generation, transmission, load, or operating\nconditions could require changes in the protection systems of others.\n\nIf protection changes are needed for interconnections with neighboring TOs, GOs,\nand/or Balancing Authorities (BAs), the TO or GO shall coordinate protection system\nsettings as required with neighboring TOs, GOs, and BAs, including but not limited to,\nNew York and New Brunswick.\n\nOutage coordination for Protection System Components is described in Section V.\nTOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall:\n\n     - notify ISO prior to making changes to protection systems as further described\n\nin Section IV; and\n\n     - provide the resulting characteristics of each changed protection system for ISO\n\napproval as described in Section VI.\n\nFigure 1a shows the planned Protection System/topology change, Protection System\nDegradation and outage coordination flow diagram. The figure illustrates the\nindividual steps that are necessary when:\n\n     - Applicable Protection System Component characteristics are modified\n\n     - Protection System Components experience Degradation due to unplanned\n\ncircumstances\n\n     - Planned Protection System Component outages occur\n\n     - Topology changes are planned\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1a - Protective Relay Coordination and Outage Reporting Overview Flow Diagram\n\nSystem Topology Change or Routine Relay Settings Change\n\n**START**\n\nNon-Topology related relay\n\n**characteristic changes** Transmission or\nrequiring collaboration generation relay Entry (DDMS Gen Transmission Owner\n\nNotification setting information or ShareFile for ISO review/ Yes or Lead MP for\n\n**START** needed per Yes for change, OP transmission approval Generator Owner\n\nOP Section VI OP Section VI.B.1\n\n**Planned topology related change requiring I.3.9** Sections VI.B.3 or VI.E.3.b or VI.E.3.b) No requests outage\n\nReview\n\nProceed with\n\nNo protection\n\noutage Change not Notification to\n\nRevise Plan approved (for neighboring entities\n\nreliability) i.e.\n\nRC / TO / GO when\n\nnecessary\n\nRefer to ISO - Tariff I.3.9, PP-5-1 and OP-24 Section VI\n\n**_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _**\n\nProtection System Degradation\n\n**START**\n\nProtection System\n\nComponent failure or\n\n**Degradation per OP**\n\nSection I and V\n\nOwner Protection\n\nOwner Initial Outage Notification Real Time\n\nLCC Protection\n\nNotification needed Yes Notification to LCC LCC Initial Relay to LCC per Outage Notification Assessment ISO\n\nand investigation Notification per OP OP Section V.A.3 Control Room\n\nfor transmission per to ISO per\n\nper Section V.A.2 and owner and Real-Time\n\nSection V.A?

Facilities Applicable for Notification of Failure or Degradation and Protection Outage Requests \n\n**A. Generation Facilities**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nFor generators connected to transmission facilities 100 kV and above, it is\nnecessary to provide a notification of failure or Degradation of generator\nprotection, or when a protection outage impacts transmission as shown in Figure\n2, since slow clearing could impact the transmission system. Even if a generator\nis connected to transmission facilities above 100 kV, it is not necessary to request\noutages for normal maintenance and testing work that could only result in tripping\na generator breaker that does not trip BES transmission facilities. Generator\ninterconnection voltage does not establish requirements for generators to provide\nthe characteristics described in Section VI.\n\nThis section describes the applicable facilities for, and conditions under which,\nLead MPs are required to request generator protection outages that are planned.\nIt also describes the applicable facilities for, and conditions under which, GOs or\nGOPs are required to provide notifications of Protection System Component\nfailure or Degradation to the ISO. Section V describes how generator entities\nshall provide notification of Protection System Component failure or Degradation\nthat impacts fault clearing on the BES, and how they shall request Protection\nSystem Component outages. Section VI describes applicable facilities for which\ngenerator protection characteristics shall be provided.\n\nProtection maintenance and testing that would in any way degrade the level of\nsystem protection or system reliability provided by the generator shall not occur\nwhile the generator is on-line. GOs or GOPs shall verify that remaining protection\nis adequate for the equipment if performing on-line maintenance or testing.\n\n**1. Applicable generator facilities for notifications of generator Protection**\n\n**System Component failure or Degradation**\n\nNotification is required of any Protection System Component failure or\nDegradation resulting in slower clearing times for protection that trips breakers\non the high or low side of the Generator step-up transformer (GSU) for\ngenerators that interconnect to transmission facilities at 100 kV and above.\nNotifications of Protection System Component failure or Degradation and the\nsubsequent request of a Protection System Component outage are described,\nrespectively, in Sections V.A and V.B. Notification is not required of Protection\nSystem Component failure or Degradation for generators that are\ninterconnected below 100 kV.\n\n2. **Applicable generator facility requests for Protection System Component**\n\n**maintenance and testing outages**\n\nFigure 2 illustrates that for generators connected at 100 kV and above,\nprotection outages that trip related BES transmission facilities shall be\n\n\n-----\n\nreported to the ISO. When Protection System Components that do not impact\nBES transmission (i.e. the Protection System Components only trip the\ngenerator breaker) are tested, it is not necessary for the Lead MP to submit an\noutage request. Reports of Protection System Component outages are not\nrequired for generators that interconnect at voltages below 100 kV.\n\nFigure 2 - Outage Reporting for Generator Protection System Components\n\n**B. Transmission Facilities**\n\n**1. Applicable facilities for notifications of Protection System Component**\n\n**failure or Degradation**\n\nTOs shall investigate and immediately notify their respective LCC after\nconfirming any failures or Degradation of Protection System Components that\nprotect any facilities associated with transmission stations as noted in OP-24\nAppendix C - Transmission Facilities Required to Report Protection\nCharacteristic, Failures or Degradation (OP-24C). Investigation and\nnotification are described in detail in Section V.A below.\n\n2. **Applicable facilities for requesting Protection System Component**\n\n**maintenance and testing outages**\n\nOP-24C lists stations for which transmission Protection System Component\noutages shall be requested. TOs shall submit a protection outage request for\nany transmission facility connected to a transmission station listed in OP-24C.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C. RAS or ACS**\n\n**For RAS:**\n**NPCC Reliability Reference Directory #7 Remedial Action Schemes[1] has**\nreplaced the term Special Protection System (SPS) with Remedial Action Scheme\n(RAS). The New England transmission system has a subset of Automatic Control\nSchemes (ACS) and NPCC approved SPS in service that are now defined as RAS\nusing the following criteria from NPCC Directory #7:\n\n**Type I: A RAS, other than a Limited Impact RAS, that recognizes or anticipates**\nabnormal system conditions resulting from design or operating criteria contingencies.\n**Type II: A RAS, other than a Limited Impact RAS, that recognizes or anticipates**\nabnormal system conditions resulting from extreme contingencies or other extreme\ncauses.\n\n**Limited Impact[2]: A RAS that cannot, by inadvertent operation or failure to operate,**\ncause or contribute to BES or Bulk Power System (BPS) cascading, uncontrolled\naction, angular instability, voltage instability, voltage collapse, or unacceptably\ndamped oscillations[3].\n\n**For ACS:**\nAs per the ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-5[4] - Requirements And\n**Guidelines For Application Of Remedial Action Schemes And Automatic**\n**Control Schemes, an ACS is defined as any scheme that automatically changes**\nsystem topology and is not classified as a RAS according to NERC and NPCC’s\ndefinitions, with exceptions mentioned in the ISO New England Planning Procedure\nNo. 5-5.\n\nTOs or Lead MPs for GOs shall:\n\n     - Provide notification to their respective LCC of Protection System\n\nComponent failures or Degradation and request planned outages\nassociated with, or that affect the operation of a RAS or ACS as described\nin Section V.\n\n**D. Implementation for Notification of Failure or Degradation and Protection**\n\n**Outage Requests**\n\n1. For generators, Lead MPs shall submit outage requests and GOs and\n\nGOPs shall provide failure or Degradation notifications as applicable under\nSection IV.A.\n\n1 [NPCC Reliability Reference Directory #7 Remedial Action Schemes](https://www.npcc.org/content/docs/public/program-areas/standards-and-criteria/regional-criteria/directories/directory-7-sect-3-clean-20210119.pdf)\n2 This classification was formerly known as Type III.\n3 Consistent with PRC-012 Supplemental Information, limited impact RAS is intended to act upon/mitigate\nevents   that are limited to a \"contained area\". (similar to \"local area\" within NPCC)\n4 [ISO New England Planning Procedure No. 5-5](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp05_5/pp5_5.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Outage requests and failure or Degradation notifications for transmission\n\nProtection System Components are required for any element connected at\n100 kV and above for a facility listed in OP-24C.\n\n3. If a transmission facility is added to or removed from OP-24C, then the TO\n\nfor such facility shall provide outage, failure or Degradation notifications in\ncompliance with this OP on or before 180 calendar days from the effective\ndate of the updated and published OP-24C.\n\n\n-----\n\n### V. Protection System Component Failure Degradation and Outage Coordination\n\n**NOTE**\n\nTOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall notify ISO prior to making relay settings\nchanges in accordance with Section VI.\n\nThis section describes the requirements for notification of Protection System\nComponent failure or Degradation, as well as the requirements for reporting of\nProtection System Component outages. For a transmission facility with Protection\nSystem Components that has multiple owners within New England, protection\noutage failure or Degradation information shall be reviewed by the protection staff of\nthe entities operating any/all terminal(s) of the jointly operated facility in order to\ncoordinate the Protection System Component outage request.\n\n**A. Notification of Generation and Transmission Protection System**\n\n**Component Failure or Degradation:**\n\nIf Protection System Component failure or Degradation occurs, then it shall be\nreported as shown in Figure 2. For a generator connected at 100 kV or above or\nas listed in OP-24C for a transmission facility, the notification process involves\nseveral steps by the following entities:\n```\n      o the entities that own the Protection System Components (i.e. TOs and\n\n```\nGOs)\n```\n      o LCCs\n      o the ISO\n\n```\n**NOTE**\n\nThe Owner Initial Protection Notification is intended to provide the LCC and the\nISO with lead time to develop a plan in case of failure or Degradation that cannot\nbe immediately repaired, coincident with the TO, GO, or GOP determination of\nparts availability and repair capability.\n\nIn order to provide enough time for operator action, while avoiding false\nindications of system issues, notifications shall be made as follows:\n\n1. An Owner Initial Protection Notification shall be made to the LCC:\n```\n      o by a TO immediately after confirming a failure or potential Degradation of\n\n```\nan applicable Protection System Component as specified in OP-24C (this\nOwner Initial Protection Notification shall be based on verification of the\nactual Protection System Component status);\n```\n      o by a GO or GOP immediately after confirming a failure or potential\n\n```\nDegradation of a Protection System Component that affects facilities for\ngenerators connected at 100 kV and above.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. If the Protection System Component failure or potential Degradation is\n\nconfirmed by the TO, GO, or GOP, then the LCC shall issue an LCC Initial\nProtection Notification to ISO regarding the failure or potential Degradation.\n\n3. When the investigation by the TO, GO or GOP concludes that there is a\n\nDegradation of the Protection System Component that cannot be immediately\nrepaired, the TO, GO, or GOP shall issue an Owner Protection Outage\nNotification to the LCC which, in turn, shall issue an LCC Protection Outage\nNotification to ISO.\n\n4. Following the LCC Protection Outage Notification regarding the failure or\n\nDegradation, the TO, or MP who owns or represents the Protection System\nComponent shall complete an outage request for the Protection System\nComponent as described in Subsection B below.\n\n**B. Outage Requests for Generation and Transmission Protection System**\n\n**Component Equipment**\n\nProtection System Component outage requests shall be submitted when\nfailure or Degradation occurs or in advance of Protection System Component\noutages related to capital improvements, testing, and maintenance which\nmay also be used to deploy setting changes upon completion of the related\nISO review process as described in Section VI. TOs and Lead MPs for GOs\nshall submit planned Protection System Component outage requests to LCCs\nand ISO in accordance with the time requirements listed in Table 1 below and\nin accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3\nTransmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3). Entities are encouraged to submit\nProtection System Component outage requests earlier than the Table 1\ndeadlines, when possible, to reduce the risk of ISO rejection of outage\nrequests, if additional time is needed for collecting information and performing\nanalysis.\n\n**Table 1 - Minimum Advance Notice Requirements for Relay / Communication**\n\n**(RLY / COM) Constraint Type**\n\n**Advance Notice**\n\n**Voltage** **5**\n\n**Facility Type** **Not**\n**(kV)** **Business** **Informational**\n\n**Required**\n\n**Days**\n\n**_Special Protection Systems (RAS and_**\n**X**\n**_ACS)_**\n\n**345, 230** **_Relay and Communication_**\n\nImpact to the Table in Appendix D **X**\n\n**No impact to the Table in Appendix D** **X**\n\n**_Special Protection Systems (RAS and_**\n**X**\n**_ACS))_**\n\n**_Relay and Communication_**\n\n**115, 69**\n\nImpact to the Table in Appendix D **X***\n\n**No impact to the Table in Appendix D** **X***\n\n**Not listed in OP-24C** **X**\n\n*** Refer to OP-24C for Protection System Component notification requirements**\n\n|Table 1 - Minimum Advance Notice Requirements for Relay / Communication (RLY / COM) Constraint Type|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Voltage (kV)|Facility Type|Advance Notice|||\n|||5 Business Days|Informational|Not Required|\n|345, 230|Special Protection Systems (RAS and ACS)|X|||\n||Relay and Communication||||\n||Impact to the Table in Appendix D|X|||\n||No impact to the Table in Appendix D||X||\n|115, 69|Special Protection Systems (RAS and ACS))|X|||\n||Relay and Communication||||\n||Impact to the Table in Appendix D|X*|||\n||No impact to the Table in Appendix D||X*||\n||Not listed in OP-24C|||X|\n\n\n-----\n\nISO outage approvals may allow the removal of Protection System Components\nfrom service, when equipment is energized, if the TO or Lead MP for GO\n(consistent with ownership) determines that adequate redundant or backup\nprotection is provided. The ISO shall evaluate the loss of any remaining\nProtection System Component functionality and document the operating\naction(s) to be taken if remaining Protection System Component functionality is\nlost.\n\nTOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall provide additional information regarding\nclearing times or additional elements tripped by completing Appendix D to this\nOP - Required Protection Outage Request Form and Examples (OP-24D).\n\n**C. Protection System Component Outages of a Duration Greater than 30**\n\n**Calendar Days**\n\nTOs and Lead MPs for GOs shall avoid Protection System Component outages\nthat last longer than 30 calendar days. If a Protection System Component that is\ninvolved in the protection of equipment listed in OP-24C is out-of-service for\nlonger than 30 calendar days, then the TOP with information from the TO or\nLead MP for the GO shall provide:\n```\n   o an attachment to the outage request showing progress in restoring the\n\n```\nProtection System Component to service; and\n```\n   o a corrective action plan describing the steps that will be undertaken to\n\n```\nrestore the Protection System Component to service.\n\nThe ISO reserves the right to disconnect from the system, any transmission or\ngeneration element that has unacceptable protection performance, which could\nresult in adverse impact on system reliability. The ISO may invoke this right for\nan outage lasting less than 30 calendar days.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VI. Relay Characteristics Provided to ISO\n\n**A. Modifying Relay Settings for Emergencies**\n\nWhen necessary to ensure the reliability of the power system (for example, by\nreducing the risk of a misoperation), a TO or GO may make relay settings\nmodifications before notifying ISO. Specifically, in such an emergency, a TO or\nGO may provide the notifications described in Section V within seven (7)\nBusiness Days after the date of the emergency, and the notifications shall also\ninclude a description of the emergency.\n\n**B. Protection System Components for Generating Facilities**\n\n1. **Applicable Facilities**\n\nLead MPs for GOs shall perform periodic reviews of relay characteristics for\ngeneration facilities with a single point of interconnection over 100 kV with\ngross plant/facility aggregate nameplate rating greater than or equal to 75\nMVA and at any other facility where the ISO has indicated in writing to the\nLead MP for the GO, that the characteristics are needed for reliability studies.\n\n2. **Data Transmittals, Creation of Models, and Protection Updates for**\n\n**Generation Facilities**\n\nLead MPs for GOs with new or modified generation facilities that meet the\napplicability as described in section VI.B.1 shall provide the required data,\nusing the Dynamics Data Management System (DDMS),[5] at least 90 calendar\ndays prior to Commercial operation along with as-built settings prior to\nCommercial operation. In addition, the Lead MP for the GO shall promptly\nand fully respond to any additional data requests and any questions from the\nISO regarding the relay setting characteristics.\n\nIf, subsequent to the development and certification of the initial PSS/E\ngenerator relay models, any relay setting characteristics for a generation\nfacility changes, then the Lead MP for the GO shall develop updated PSS/E\ngenerator relay models itself. Appendix A[6] to this OP - Generator Relay\nSettings (OP-24A) provides guidance that Lead MPs for GOs may use when\ncreating relay models for PSS/E from actual relay settings. Additional\ninformation can be found in the document named “Generator Protection\nModeling Practice & Guidelines” posted on the ISO’s external website at:\n\n[http://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc](http://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc)\n\n5 DDMS can be accessed at https://smd.iso-ne.com/\n6 Appendix A is based on the NERC document: Considerations for Power Plant and Transmission System\nProtection Coordination, Technical Reference Document – Revision 2, System Protection and Control\nSubcommittee, July 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NOTE**\n\nLead MPs for GOs do not need to inform ISO of changes to protective relays\nnot listed in OP-24 Appendix A. Those changes shall be coordinated in\naccordance with NERC Standard PRC-027.\n\nUsing DDMS, the Lead MP for the GO shall submit, to the ISO, updates to\nrelay settings characteristics and information, including revised PSS/E\ngenerator relay models, at least 120 calendar days in advance of making\npermanent changes to the relay characteristics specified in OP-24A. This will\nprovide ISO time to review the effect of protection changes on system stability\nperformance.\n\n3. **Certification and Recertification of Generator Relay Models**\n\nLead MPs for GOs shall certify in DDMS that the generator relay models\ndeveloped pursuant to Section VI.B.2 are accurate, per the timeline\nestablished in Section VI.B.2.\n\nLead MPs for GOs shall recertify, on an annual basis, that generator relay\nmodels are accurate. The recertification shall be performed in DDMS as part\nof the certification of other generator dynamics and other data required\npursuant to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical\nRequirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related\nDemands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14).\n\n4. **Standard Models and Generator Breaker Tripping Information**\n\nOP-24A includes commonly used PSS/E standard models for relay functions.\nA Lead MP for the GO may select a different standard PSS/E library model if\nmore appropriate. Provision of user-written models for relays is not\nacceptable.\n\n5. **Clearing Time Information for GO Owned Substations and Transmission**\n\nLead MPs for GOs with transmission equipment connected at 100 kV and\nabove (i.e. lines, generator step-up transformers and associated equipment)\nand generator breakers on the low side of the GSU shall be provided in\naccordance with Section VI.C and VI.E.\n\n**C. Transmission Equipment Data Submittals**\n\n1. Transmission Owners that are also Transmission Planners (TO-TPs) shall\n\nprovide protection characteristics as described below, to the ISO System\nProtection Working Group (SPWG) ShareFile folder.\n\n2. Generator Owners (GOs) shall provide protection information associated with\n\ntransmission equipment in the manner specified in the ISO data request.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Other Protection Asset Owners shall provide protection information in the\n\nmanner specified in the ISO data request.\n\n**D. Transient Swing Detection Characteristics for Transmission Lines:**\n\n1. **Model Submittal Requirements**\n\na. Certain ISO-conducted planning studies use a generic distance relay\n\nmodel to monitor for the possible tripping of non-faulted elements due to\nstable power swings. The generic relay model used is as follows:\n\n(1) Reach equal to 300% of the impedance of the monitored line with\nall lines in-service and no intentional tripping time delay\n\n(2) In any instances where this generic model shows that a line is\nsusceptible to tripping without a fault during power swings, the\nISO shall require that the appropriate TO(s) provide relay models\nfor any relays that could trip a terminal of the line without\nrequiring a permissive signal from the opposite terminal(s) of the\nline.\n\nb. For multi-terminal lines, the generic relay model used by the ISO shall\n\nhave a reach equal to 300% of the total impedance to the furthest terminal\nof the line, without considering infeed current from other terminals.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe exclusion described in Section VI.D.1.c. addresses the fact that a permissive\nrelay scheme (such as a Permissive over-reaching transfer trip (POTT) scheme)\nwill not trip unless the apparent impedance at both terminals of the transmission\nline enters the fault characteristic zone. This can only happen if a point along the\ntransmission line has a voltage equal to zero - meaning that either the line is\nfaulted or the swing is not stable (the two terminals of the line are out-of-step with\neach other). A directional comparison blocking scheme can act if only one\nterminal’s apparent impedance enters the fault characteristic zone.\n\nc. TOs shall provide relay models to the ISO for any relays with a reach that\n\nexceeds 300% of the total impedance of the line, and that operate with an\nintentional delay less than or equal to 60 cycles. This data shall be\nrequired only for relays that could trip one or more terminals of the line\nwithout requiring a permissive signal from the opposite terminal(s) of the\nline. For example, data for step-distance or directional comparison\nblocking schemes reaching beyond 300% of the total impedance of the\nline is required; but data for POTT schemes is not required, because\nthese schemes would not act without a permissive signal from the\nopposite terminal.\n\nd. TOs shall provide all required relay reach modeling information in a DYR\n\nfile format, usable in the PSS/E software package. Models shall be\nsubmitted using the SPWG ShareFile folder within 15 Business Days of\nan ISO request, or at least 120 days prior to a change resulting in relay\n\n\n-----\n\nreach beyond 300% of line impedance. Changes may require approval\npursuant to the timing and other requirements of Section I.3.9 of the ISO\nTariff before implementation.\n\n2. **Implementation**\n\nTOs shall provide actual models for lines that are susceptible to tripping\nduring transient swings as outlined in Sections VI.D.1.c and VI.D.1.d. When\nmaking any settings changes in accordance with Section VI.D.1.d, TOs shall\nprovide the information in accordance with that Section.\n\nTOs shall provide relay models for relays that reach beyond 300% of the line\nimpedance, as described in VI.D.1.c.\n\n**E. Fault Clearing Information for Lines, Transformers and Shunt Devices:**\n\n**1. Equipment For Which Fault Clearing Data Is Required**\n\nThe ISO uses fault-clearing information to simulate clearing of criteria\nrequired faults in assessing the acceptable performance of the power system.\nTOs and, as determined under Section VI.B.5, Lead MPs for GOs\n(collectively, Protection Asset Owners) shall provide the fault clearing\ninformation as specified in Appendix B to this OP - Transmission Relaying\nCharacteristics (OP-24B) for all equipment with at least one terminal\nconnected to 100 kV and above, as well as for all PTF facilities at 69 kV.\nProtection Asset Owners shall coordinate responses for a line that connects\nsubstations with different owners.\n\n**2. Implementation**\n\na. As applicable, Protection Asset Owners shall provide fault-clearing\n\ninformation for all equipment with at least one terminal connected at 100\nkV and above, as well as for all PTF facilities at 69 kV within 180 calendar\ndays of the original request.\n\nb. The ISO may request protection system data for a limited set of specific\n\ntransmission or generation elements that is not already provided pursuant\nto OP-24B. Protection Asset Owners shall respond to such requests by\nproviding fault clearing information according to the following timelines:\n\n(1) if needed for planning purposes, within 20 Business Days of receiving\na request from the ISO; or\n\n(2) if needed for operations purposes, within 2 Business Days of receiving\na request from the ISO.\n\nc. The ISO shall initiate an annual certification that the clearing times\n\nprovided by Protection Asset Owners are accurate. Each Protection\nAsset Owner shall certify that the clearing times on file with the ISO are\ncurrently valid and correct.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Data Required and Submission Process**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nProtection Asset Owners shall provide a “proxy” clearing time representing the\nmost conservative clearing time by ground overcurrent relays. TOs shall provide\nthe exact ground overcurrent relay model for a given transmission element if the\nISO determines that the simulation fails using the “proxy” clearing time.\n\nProtection Asset Owners shall provide the overcurrent relay model in a format\nacceptable to the ISO (relay settings data is not acceptable).\n\na. The format for protection system data submittal is included in OP-24B.\n\nOP-24B requires default clearing time information for transmission lines,\ntransformers, substation equipment, and breakers. When the equipment\ndoes not clear within the default clearing time, it is necessary to provide\nadditional information on the protection characteristics in OP-24B. As part\nof this process, any data on step-distance on transmission lines shall be\nsubmitted if these schemes are the fastest protection schemes in one of\nthe two redundant systems. Completed versions of OP-24B, shall be\nsubmitted as specified in section VI.C.\n\nb. Any change to the existing protection at substations that are listed in\n\nOP-24C that affects clearing times or relay reaches, except for those\nwhere both the pre- and post- change clearing times are less than or\nequal to (<) the applicable default clearing time, or any new protection\nsubject to OP-24B (e.g. due to topology changes), shall be submitted to\nISO at least 60 calendar days in advance of energization. This time\nrequirement does not apply to emergency conditions as described in\nSection VI.A, or temporary changes of less than one year, for\nconstruction or replacements. This requirement also does not apply to\nall other elements in OP-24B that are not at the substations listed in\nOP-24C, and any changes to protection systems to these facilities shall\nbe reported as a part of the annual recertification. These changes may\nrequire approval pursuant to Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff if applicable.\nAll changes and updates shall be submitted as specified in section\nVI.C.\n\nc. In addition to the information described above, certain ISO planning\n\nstudies consider contingencies with delayed fault-clearing due to the\nfailure of a non-redundant protection package to protect the faulted\nelement as designed, such as for one of the following:\n\n(1) Generator\n\n(2) Transmission circuit\n\n(3) Transformer\n\n(4) Shunt device\n\n(5) Bus section\n\n\n-----\n\nFor these studies, the ISO shall request additional information and the TO\nshall provide the data in accordance with the description contained in the\nrequest. This information shall be provided within 20 Business Days of\nreceiving the request from the ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VII. Specific Relay Settings Information\n\n**A. Protection System Components for Generating Facilities**\n\nOP-14 includes additional specifications for generator protection settings.\n\n**B. Transmission Automatic Reclosing Requirements**\n\nTOs shall provide the time delay for automatic line reclosing pursuant to OP-24B.\nAutomatic line reclosing, if set properly, expedites the return-to-service of a line\nfollowing a temporary fault. However, reclosing may cause system and generator\ninstability, generator or transmission equipment fatigue and failure, as well as\nother issues that could have an adverse impact on reliability. In order to balance\nthe varied needs of the New England Transmission System, the ISO shall review\nthe data, submitted by the TOs, on the time delay for automatic line reclosing.\nThe ISO shall apply the following principles in its review:\n\n1. High-speed automatic reclosing [referred to as high-speed reclosing in NERC\n\nReliability Standards and High-Speed Auto reclosing in the NPCC Glossary of\nTerms], is automatic reclosing that occurs in less than one second, and is not\npermitted for use on the New England Transmission System. The ISO will not\nsupport the installation and use of high-speed automatic reclosing in New\nEngland. The ISO shall be promptly notified about any existing high-speed\nautomatic reclosing. The ISO may order that any existing high-speed\nautomatic reclosing be taken out-of-service until technical analysis can confirm\nthat it does not cause an adverse impact to system reliability. The ISO shall\nevaluate automatic reclosing occurring at one second for acceptance on a\ncase-by-case basis; the ISO may order that any existing one second automatic\nreclosing be taken out-of-service until the technical analysis can confirm that it\ndoes not cause an adverse impact to system reliability.\n\n2. Automatic reclosing slower than 1 second but faster than:\n```\n        o 5 seconds for 230 kV, 138 kV, and 115 kV facilities; or\n        o 15 seconds for 345 kV facilities;\n\n```\nshall be reviewed by the ISO with a potential recommendation to reset the\nreclosing time delay if the ISO finds an adverse impact on system reliability.\n\n3. Automatic reclosing equal to or slower than\n```\n        o 5 seconds for 230 kV, 138 kV and 115 kV facilities; or\n        o 15 seconds for 345 kV facilities;\n\n```\nshall typically not require ISO review.\n\nThe above time delays refer to any interval between consecutive attempts to\nautomatically reclose.\n\nThese settings fall within the typical reclosing assumptions used in ISO’s past\nplanning and operating studies and, as such, have raised no reliability\n\n\n-----\n\nconcerns. However, if the ISO finds an adverse impact on system reliability,\nthen the ISO may recommend that the reclosing time delay be reset.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VIII.

DDR data may contain information about specific generators and\nabout the critical energy infrastructure of New England. For these reasons, all DDR\ndata, including the list of DDR locations, must be protected under the ISO New\nEngland Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff), Attachment D ISO New England Information Policy. TOs shall submit DDR data to ISO when\nrequested using the method described in the request.\n\n**A. Entities That May Request DDR Data**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nDDR data shall be made available in accordance with the ISO Tariff Attachment D ISO New England Information Policy\n\nExternal entities which can request data are:\n\na. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),\n\nb. NERC\n\nc. Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC).\n\nd. TOs and Generation Owners (GOs) within NPCC\n\n**B.

This section\nprovides the requirements for PMUs as established by the DDR/PMU Working\nGroup. A stand-alone PMU is not subject to the PRC-002 requirements for a DDR\nunless it is also used as a DDR. Each PMU shall meet the following requirements:\n\n1. Each PMU shall provide a stream of synchrophasors for each required\n\ncurrent and voltage in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 format. The data stream\nchannel names shall adhere to the submitted and approved Registry form. A\ntemplate for the Registry form is provided in Appendix C. All synchrophasor\ndata shall be reported in Coordinated Universal Time (“UTC time”) with zero\noffset.\n\n2. The timing device providing the clock signal shall be accurate to at least one\n\nmicrosecond. Equipment shall also support correct leap second insertion.\nThe timing signal shall be of sufficient strength for each PMU device.\n\n3. The PMU shall develop and transmit a synchrophasor at least once every\n\none-thirtieth of a second with the capability of increasing the rate to once\nevery one-sixtieth of a second.\n\n4. Synchrophasors shall be derived from all three phases or from a single phase\n\nmeasurement:\n\na. If three phase measurements are used, only one synchrophasor shall be\n\nprovided (i.e., the positive sequence synchrophasor).\n\nb. If single phase measurements are used, the voltage synchrophasor shall\n\nbe derived from the same phase as the current synchrophasor, and both\nshall originate from phase B if possible.\n\nc. For the ISO calculated MW and MVAR derived from the voltage and\n\ncurrent signals, the TO must follow the polarity convention designated in\nOP-18 Appendix D, Figure 1.\n\n5. Voltage synchrophasors for each station bus shall be provided from each\n\nspecified voltage level or if measurements are based on equipment\nconnected to only one bus, then two or more independent voltage\nsynchrophasors shall be provided. If an independent source voltage is not\navailable, then line voltage measurements are acceptable. Bus voltage\nmeasurements are preferred but multiple line voltage measurements are\nacceptable if bus measurements are not readily available.\n\n6. Voltage and current measurements shall be provided on all specified facilities\n\nper Appendix B as indicated in the column “Monitored Electrical Quantities”\n\n7. PMUs shall be powered by the station DC supply.\n\n**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**\n\n\n-----\n\n8. PMUs shall stream data continuously to ISO through a SCADA Center or\n\nLCC Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC). Compliance for PMU data streaming\nremains the responsibility of the PMU owner.\n\n9. Each PDC shall have at least thirty (30) days of local storage capability.\n\n10. The PMU shall continuously stream all current (I) and voltage (V) channel\n\ndata to ISO throughout power system events. If a PMU or an associated PDC\ndoes not continuously stream during a power system event, then the TO\nresponsible for the PMU and PDC shall respond to an ISO request for\ninformation by providing:\n\na. All available disturbance monitoring equipment information and records\n\nwithin ten (10) Business Days. Under special circumstances (e.g. storm\nrestoration) the ten Business Day response may be extended by\nagreement between ISO-NE and the responsible TO.\n\nb. A detailed description of why the PMU or PDC failed, within sixty (60)\n\ncalendar days.\n\nc. A Corrective Action Plan provided within ninety (90) calendar days of the\n\nISO request for information.\n\n11. If PMU communications are lost during an event, the ISO shall notify the TO\n\nwhen continuous streaming is discontinued during a power system event, so\nthat troubleshooting can be facilitated by the TO. ISO shall notify the TO that\nthe continuous streaming was lost, within ten (10) Business Days or less\nwhen data is required for ISO event analysis.\n\n12. For PMU installations only, average Latency shall be equal to or less than 0.5\n\nseconds. Maximum Latency shall be equal to or less than 1.5 seconds.\nLatency is defined as arrival time at the ISO PDC minus the PMU time stamp.\n\n**VII.** **PMU INSTALLATIONS FOR EXISTING FACILITIES**\n\nIf existing monitoring equipment in a Pool Transmission Facility (PTF) transmission\nstation is not capable of providing power system response information, PMU\ninstallations shall be required.\n\n1. All PTF transmission stations listed in Appendix B shall include a PMU\n\ninstallation.\n\n2. PMUs shall develop the synchrophasors for all transmission elements at\n\nidentified voltage levels at stations as listed in Appendix B.\n\n3. PMUs shall monitor all station elements associated with STATCOMs,\n\nSynchronous Condensers, SVCs and load where specified.\n\n4. PMUs shall be installed in accordance with the dates listed in Appendix B.\n\n**VIII.** **PMU ADDITIONS WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION OR MODIFICATIONS**\n\nPMUs at PTF transmission stations provide needed information on system\nperformance for modeling calibration, transfer and operating limit validation and\noptimization, and post-event re-creation, all of which are needed to reliably operate\nthe transmission system. Any PMUs required by the below criteria will monitor the\nPTF transmission station and all line and transformer terminals. For purposes of this\n\n**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**\n\n\n-----\n\nsection, the term generation means any resource connected to the PTF, non-PTF\ntransmission or distribution systems (including any subsystem thereof or behind a\ncustomer meter) that is capable of providing energy injection or energy withdrawal\n(this includes, but is not limited to, inverter-based generation, electric storage\nresources, and distributed generation).\n\nTransmission Owners shall install PMUs based on the following criteria:\n\n1. All new 345 kV PTF stations and any other PTF locations as specified by ISO\n\nshall include a PMU installation. ISO shall specify new locations for PMU\ninstallations for system observability. Such locations include, but are not\nlimited to, PTF transmission stations that connect significant load,\ntransmission, HVDC or generation to the transmission system. PMUs for new\n345 kV PTF stations shall be in-service when the new station goes into\nservice. PMU in-service dates for ISO identified PTF stations will be agreed\nupon by ISO and the Transmission Owner.\n\n2. When new elements are added to a station with an existing PMU, PMU\n\nmonitoring shall be added and made active for the new elements on the PTF\nside prior to energization. Each new element requiring PMU channels shall\ninclude lines (AC and AC side of DC), transformers (high and low side for\nPTF transformers) and dynamic reactive devices.\n\n3. At new or existing TO PTF stations that are at a voltage of 100 kV or greater\n\nwhere new generation or new dynamic reactive devices (such as\nsynchronous condensers, statcoms or SVCs) interconnect directly to the\ntransmission system. PMUs monitoring new generation additions and\ndynamic VAR devices should be monitoring and in-service when the\ngeneration begins performing non-commercial testing with initial sync.\n\n4. At new Transmission Owner PTF stations with planned generation totaling at\n\nleast 20 MVA or 20 MW nameplate, including distribution connected\ngeneration. For new PTF stations built for generator interconnection, PMUs\nmonitoring the new generation interconnection shall be monitoring and inservice when the generation begins performing non-commercial testing.\n\n5. For existing PTF stations that will connect at least 20 MVA or 20 MW\n\nnameplate of generation as described in this Section VIII of this OP-22, the\nPMUs monitoring new generation additions shall be monitoring and in-service\nwhen aggregated generation of at least 20 MVA or 20 MW nameplate begins\nperforming non-commercial testing If commencing monitoring at the time the\ngeneration begins performing non-commercial testing is not possible, then the\nTO shall coordinate with ISO to determine the schedule for PMU installation.\n\nThis threshold is met when the next generator preceding commercial status\nwill cause the sum of the DER to equal or exceed 20 MVA or 20 MW.\n\n6. For existing PTF stations that already connect at least 20 MVA or 20 MW\n\nnameplate of generation as described herein, the TO shall coordinate with\nISO to determine the schedule for PMU installation. The TO shall determine\nwhen stations meet these criterion. For existing stations the TO shall\nidentify the stations that meet this criteria by December 1, 2023. TOs shall\n\n**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**\n\n\n-----\n\ncoordinate with ISO to develop a PMU installation plan using this list by\nFebruary 1, 2024.\n\n7. For stations that are non-PTF that connect 20 MVA or 20 MW of generation\n\nas described herein, PMUs shall be installed at the nearest PTF stations to\ncapture these non-PTF station flows.\n\n8. Distribution entity Market Participants that do not own the stations supplying\n\nthem shall annually provide amounts of DER and synchronous generation\ninstalled within their service territory by station to their interconnecting\nTransmission Owner(s)\n\nThe ISO shall include each identified station under these criteria in Appendix B to\nthis OP prior to the PMU being required to be in service.\n\n**IX.** **SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS**\n\nA TO shall notify ISO of any station where PMU installation would necessitate\nsignificant modifications, such as, but not limited, to:\n\n1. New cable tray or cable trench installation\n\n2. Extensive rerouting of existing cables or other facilities\n\n3. Additions or modifications to building structure\n\nWhen notified of significant modifications per this requirement, ISO shall consider\nother stations for PMU installations, review those considerations with the respective\nTO and revise Appendix B, as needed.\n\n**X.** **TESTING, VERIFICATION, MAINTENANCE AND OUTAGE REPORTING**\n\n**A. Overall Requirements**\n\nEach TO shall properly maintain its DDR and PMU equipment in accordance with\napplicable ANSI/IEEE and NERC Reliability Standards, as amended from time-totime.

PDC Software Updates**\n\nTo obtain reliable data, the PDC shall use a reliable version of software or\nfirmware in agreement with ISO. Prior to installation, any new software updates\nshall be assessed by the TO and tested prior to production use to ensure\nsoftware has been verified for the upgrade.\n\n**E. Clock Out-of-Synch**\n\nIf the time source is out-of-service or out of synchronization, then a Real-Time\nnotification to TO personnel shall indicate clock out-of-synch.\n\n**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**\n\n\n-----\n\n**F. Testing and Outage Notifications**\n\nMaintenance testing and outage requests shall be in accordance with ISO\nOperating Procedure OP-2 Maintenance of Communications, Computers,\nMetering, and Computer Support Equipment.\n\n1. Planned Testing\n\nPrior to performing DDR, PDC or PMU testing, or testing of input signals (i.e.\nCT or VT inputs), the TO shall either take the DDR, PDC or PMU out-ofservice or stop output from the tested device to prevent erroneous signals\nfrom being sent.\n\n2. Planned Outage Notifications\n\nPlanned DDR, PDC or PMU maintenance outage notifications shall be made\nto the ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies. Outage requests shall be made at\nleast two (2) Business Days prior to the outage.\n\n3. DDR, PDC or PMU Out-of-Service Notification\n\nWhen a DDR listed in Appendix A or PMU listed in Appendix B receives an\n“Out of Service” alarm, the TO associated with the DDR or PMU shall, within\ntwo (2) Business Days of the initial discovery, either resolve the issue or notify\nthe ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies via email, of the outage.\n\nWhen a TO associated with the PDC receives an “Out of Service” alarm, the\nTO shall notify the ISO Manager, Real-Time Studies.\n\n4. Clock Out-of-Synch or Service Notification\n\nWhen a Clock associated with a DDR or PMU receives an “Out of Sync” or\n“Out of Service” alarm, the TO associated with the Clock shall, within two (2)\nBusiness Days of the initial discovery, either resolve the issue or notify the\nISO Manager, Real-Time Studies with a time estimate of when the Clock will\nbe returned to service.\n\n**G. Restoration of PDC Equipment to Service**\n\nThe PDC shall be restored to service within five (5) Business Days. Under\nspecial circumstances (e.g. storm restoration or failure of primary and back-up\nsystems), the five Business Day response may be extended by agreement\nbetween ISO-NE and the responsible TO.\n\n**H. Restoration of DDR, and PMU Equipment to Service**\n\nThe TO associated with a DDR or PMU shall make all reasonable efforts to\nrestore equipment to service that is forced out-of-service or if the quality of data\nis inadequate. Restoration should be within 90 days. If an outage lasts longer\nthan fifteen days, then the TO associated with the DDR or PMU shall provide a\nmonthly update regarding equipment status to the ISO Manager, Real-Time\nStudies. The update shall include the reason for the extended outage; a repair\nprogress update; purchase order numbers for parts and technical services; hours\nthat have been expended on equipment repair; and, updates to the corrective\naction plan.\n\n**H** **d C** **I** **U** **t** **ll d**\n\n\n-----\n\n**XI.** **OP-22 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Rev.** **Date**\n\n**No.**\n\n0 05/04/12 Initial Issue\n\n0.1 02/25/14 Periodic review performed requiring no changes;\nMade administrative changes required to publish a Minor Revision;\n\n1 01/22/15 Periodic review completed by procedure owner;\nSection III; identified new DDR Owner responsibilities;\nSection VIII, added new Appendix A - DDR Information (Confidential)\n\n2 06/06/16\nAdded Section VII (PMU Requirements);\nSection IX. added Appendix B to Appendices list:\n\n2.1 11/08/16 Periodic review performed requiring no changes;\n\nadding required corporate document identity to all page footers;\n\n3 02/08/18 Periodic review completed by procedure owner;\n\nmanagement expectations;\nChanges to incorporate the following requirements:\n\n                   \n                   - Additional PMU/PDC Maintenance Requirements;\n\n4 02/07/20 Biennial review completed by procedure owner;\n\nand management expectations;\nDeleted Local Control Center Instructions from coverpage;\n\n5 04/08/21 Periodic review completed by procedure owner;\nSection III.D; modified acronym from “DDR” to read “DDR/PMU\";\nSection VI.9: identified responsible party for maintaining streaming data\n\nsubstation\n\n6 07/01/22 Periodic review completed by procedure owner;\nUpdated Section VI to add registry format information;\nAdded Appendix C – New England PMU Registration.\n\n7 08/21/23 Periodic review completed by procedure owner;\n\nChanges to language to adjust when we want PMUs for generation;\n\nMVA or MW generation.\n\n**XII.** **APPENDICES**\n\nAppendix A - DDR Information (Confidential)\n\nAppendix B - PMU Information (Confidential)\n\nAppendix C – New England PMU Registration\n\n|Rev.

This ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing\n\n(OP-23), describes the methods by which ISO verifies certain resource\ncapabilities including:\n\n     - ten and thirty minute off-line reserve capability\n\n     - Seasonal Claimed Capability (SCC)\n\n     - reactive capability\n\nB. Based upon the audit results, ISO may limit the value of the parameter that can\n\nbe submitted in the Supply Offer of the resource.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **RESERVE AUDITING**\n\n**A. FAST** **STARTA.** **RESERVE** **AUDITING**\n\n**1. Economic Dispatch Fast Start Reserve Audit**\n\na. When a Fast Start Generator or Fast Start Demand Response Resource\n\nreceives an electronic dispatch signal to start (including a Market\nParticipant-requested fast start off-line reserve audit):\n\n(1) The resource shall respond to the dispatch signal in accordance with\n\nits Supply Offer.\n\n(2) ISO shall evaluate the resource response to the dispatch signal in\n\naccordance with Section III of the ISO New England, Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (Tariff), (Market Rule 1 Standard Market Design).\n\n(3) Response to these dispatch signals is used to adjust the CLAIM10 or\n\nCLAIM30 value for each resource as described in Section III.9.5 of\nthe Tariff - Forward Reserve Resources.\n\n**2. Market Participant-Requested Fast Start Reserve Audit**\n\na. For Generator Assets:\n\n(1) The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) or Designated Entity (DE)\n\nmay request that the fast start off-line reserve capability of a\nGenerator Asset be audited by submitting a request through the\nClaimed Capability Auditing Tool (CCAT) software.\n\ni. Each Lead MP or DE-requested fast start off-line reserve audit\n\nshall be performed in accordance with Section III.9.5 of the\nTariff.\n\n(2) In order to modify or rescind a request to perform a fast start off-line\n\nreserve audit the following shall be performed:\n\ni. DE: Inform the ISO control room of the request for\n\nmodification or cancellation.\n\nii. Lead MP/DE: Modify or cancel the audit request using the\n\nCCAT software.\n\nb. For Demand Response Resources (DRRs):\n\n(1) The Lead MP may request that the fast start reserve capability of a\n\nDRR be audited by submitting a request through the Demand\nResponse Audit and Testing Tool (DRATT) software.\n\n(2) In order to modify or rescind a request to perform a fast start reserve\n\naudit the following shall be performed:\n\n\n-----\n\ni. Demand DE: Inform the ISO control room of the request for\n\nmodification or cancellation.\n\nii. Lead MP/Demand DE: Modify or cancel the audit request\n\nusing the DRATT software.\n\n**3. Reporting**\n\na. ISO shall provide reports to the Lead MP of a fast start resource as follows:\n\n(1) Within two Business Days of the resource receiving a start-up\n\nDispatch Instruction, a report shall be provided stating:\n\ni. time and date of the dispatch\n\nii. target value for the dispatch\n\niii. output or reduction at 10 and 30 minutes following the initial\n\nDispatch Instruction\n\niv. whether the resource was in-service and available for 60\n\nminutes following the initial Dispatch Instruction.\n\n(2) Each week, prior to 1700 on Thursday, a report shall be provided\n\nstating the resource:\n\ni. current CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 performance factors for the\n\nfollowing week\n\nii. CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 for the following week\n\niii. maximum output at 10 and 30 minutes for the previous\n\nForward Reserve Procurement Period.\n\n**4. Disputing Audit Results**\n\na. A Lead MP may dispute the audit results obtained from a start-up Dispatch\n\nInstruction by entering an issue in the ISO Participant Support issue\ntracking system prior to noon of the third Business Day after the day on\nwhich the results were provided. The notification shall include any\nOperating Data that is not consistent with the data used by ISO to\ndetermine the results.\n\nb. While the dispute is under assessment:\n\n(1) Until the dispute has been resolved, the CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 shall\n\nbe adjusted using the ISO-derived value in accordance with Section\nIII of the Tariff.\n\n(2) ISO shall consider the data provided by the Lead MP and make good\nfaith efforts to resolve the data differences.\n\n(3) With respect to disputes, ISO shall make the final determination and\n\ninform the Lead MP of the determination.\n\n\n-----\n\ni. Any changes to a CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 resulting from the\n\nISO’s final determination with respect to a dispute is\napplicable on a prospective basis.\n\n**5. CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 Cure**\n\na. Section III.9.5.3.4 of the Tariff - Performance Factor Cure permits the Lead\n\nMP, Demand DE, or DE to submit a restoration plan to ISO in order to\nrestore a resource’s CLAIM10 or CLAIM30.\n\n(1) ISO shall evaluate the restoration plan in accordance with Section III\n\nof the Tariff.\n\n(2) Following completion of the restoration plan, the resource shall\n\nperform the Market Participant-requested audit using Section II.A.2. of\nthis Operating Procedure and the CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 shall be\nadjusted in accordance with Section III.9.5.3.4 of the Tariff.\n\n**6. Initial CLAIM10 or CLAIM30 Values**\n\na. For a resource that is newly-determined ready to respond to ISO dispatch\n\nby ISO or will be changing its registration from not being fast start capable\nto being fast start capable, the CLAIM10 and CLAIM30 are set to zero until\nthe first electronic start-up following the status change.\n\n**B.

Because response rates affect both Real-Time energy and reserves, ISO shall\n\nperform on-going response rate auditing using historical data as needed to\n\n1.\n\nverify that offered resource response rates are reflective of the resource’s\nReal-Time performance.\n\n2. ISO shall periodically provide Lead MPs with observed response rates based\n\nupon a resource’s MW offer blocks. Observed response rates are determined\n\n2.\n\nusing the method described in OP-23, Appendix K - Response Rate Auditing\nCalculation (OP-23K).\n\n3. The Lead MP shall use the provided observed response rates to offer the\n\nresource. The offered MW/Manual Response Rate (MRR) blocks may differ\nfrom the provided observed MW/MRR blocks due to ambient temperature or 3.\nReal-Time resource configuration. The Lead MP may contact ISO regarding\nprovided observed response rates by emailing RRAudits@iso-ne.com.\n\n4. ISO shall restrict the MRR offer to the maximum expected response rate\n4.\n\nbased upon historical observations.\n\n5. The Lead MP may provide ISO with a restoration plan for response rates as\n\nprovided for in Section III.1.5.2 of the Tariff - ISO-Initiated Parameter Auditing 5.\nby emailing RRAudits@iso-ne.com.\n\n6. ISO shall observe response rates following any completed restoration plan\n\nand shall modify response rate restrictions based upon observed response 6.\nrates.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. For resources that are newly-determined ready to respond to ISO dispatch by\n\nISO, the Lead MP shall offer response rates based upon the most accurate\nmanufacturer, observed, or tested values. ISO shall observe the resource’s 7.\nresponse to Dispatch Instructions and when sufficient historical data has been\nobtained, ISO shall provide observed response rates to the Lead MP.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **CLAIMED CAPABILITY AUDITS**\n\n**A. Generator Assets:**\n\n**1. General Auditing Provisions**\n\na. In order to establish and maintain accurate records of Generator Asset real\n\npower capabilities, all Generator Assets registered with ISO shall perform\nreal power capability auditing as required in Section III.1.5.1 of the Tariff Claimed Capability Audits.\n\nb. To recognize certain operating characteristics, the following conditions\n\nshall apply:\n\n(1) The Claimed Capability Audit (CCA) values of a gas turbine,\n\ncombined cycle, or pseudo combined-cycle generator shall be\nadjusted for ambient temperature, and steam exports in accordance\nwith Section III.1.5.1 of the Tariff, and using the procedures in OP-23,\nAppendix B - Capability Determination for Thermal, Pumped Storage,\nand Weekly Cycle Hydro Generator Assets (OP-23B).\n\n(2) The Claimed Capability values of non-intermittent daily cycle hydro\n\nGenerator Assets shall be based on Generator Asset characteristics\nand historical monthly river flow data, as detailed in OP-23, Appendix\nC - Capability Determination for Daily Cycle Hydro Generator Assets\n(OP-23C). Non-intermittent daily cycle hydro Generator Assets do not\nperform Establish or Seasonal CCAs.\n\n**2. Interdependence of Equipment**\n\na. Any CCA value of a Generator Asset shall reflect any limitations based\n\nupon the interdependence of common elements between two or more\nGenerator Assets such as: auxiliaries, limiting operating parameters, and\nthe deployment of operating personnel. Generator Assets that share\nequipment and/or personnel shall perform one of the following:\n\n(1) Perform CCAs concurrently on all Generator Assets that share\n\nequipment and/or personnel, to properly reflect the pertinent\nlimitations\n\n(2) Certify that the Generator Assets do not have any common limiting\n\nequipment and/or personnel by submitting OP-23, Appendix E - MultiGenerator Station Certification Form (OP-23E) to ISO.\n\n**3. Establish Claimed Capability (Establish CCA)**\n\na. To change a Generator Asset Establish CCA value, an audit shall be\n\nconducted. The Establish CCA audit shall be performed in accordance\nwith Section III.1.5.1.2 of the Tariff - Establish Claimed Capability Audit. To\nverify that a request to establish or change the Establish CCA value will be\neffective by the desired date, the Lead MP should request the audit with\nsufficient advance notice to allow time for testing and processing. The\n\n\n-----\n\nchange in audit value shall become effective in accordance with Section\nIII.1.5.1.2 of the Tariff and as follows:\n\n(1) A Generator Asset that has been declared ready to follow Dispatch\n\nInstruction by the ISO, but for which an Establish CCA has not been\nconducted, may participate in the New England Markets using the\npreliminary asset ratings and other characteristics from initial\nregistration forms, subject to later adjustments based upon\nsubsequent audited values.\n\n**4. Seasonal Claimed Capability (Seasonal CCA)**\n\na. A Seasonal Claimed Capability Audit (Seasonal CCA) is a demonstration\n\nof the capability of a Generator Asset that may be achieved through normal\ndispatch and shall be conducted in accordance with Section III.1.5.1.3 of\nthe Tariff - Seasonal Claimed Capability Audits. A specific request by the\nLead MP is not necessary. The notification by a Lead MP of past\nperformance includes the date and time period of the demonstration to be\nused, and other operating data (ambient temperature, steam exports,\nelevations, etc.) as defined in OP-23B.\n\nb. In accordance with Section III of the Tariff, ISO may issue a Seasonal CCA\n\nwindow to indicate the hour(s) during which an audit performed would meet\nthe applicable temperature requirements. The audit window(s) is (are):\n\n(1) **No less than one hour in duration.**\n\n(2) Effective on a New England-wide basis.\n\n(3) Issued for the third day from the day of posting (e.g., audit periods\n\nposted on Monday will be applicable from 0001-2359 on Thursday).\n\nc. Audit temperature windows are used to determine whether or not a\n\nGenerator Asset meets the temperature requirements of a Seasonal CCA\nand are not to be interpreted as permission to perform an audit in RealTime. Generator Assets shall follow normal scheduling and dispatch\nprocedures for the performance of an audit in the Day-Ahead or Real-Time\nEnergy Markets.\n\n**B. Demand Response Resources (DRRs)**\n\n1. A Seasonal DR Audit is a demonstration of the capability of a DRR that may\n\nbe achieved through normal dispatch or through an audit request in the\nDRATT software and shall be conducted in accordance with Section\nIII.1.5.1.3.1 of the Tariff. A specific request by the Lead MP is not necessary if\nthe Seasonal DR Audit is performed by the designation of a period of dispatch\nafter the fact.\n\n2. The notification by a Lead MP of past performance shall include the date and\n\ntime period of the demonstration to be used.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C. ISO-Initiated Audits**\n\n1. ISO may conduct an audit of the capabilities of a resource as specified in\n\nSection III.1.5.1.4 of the Tariff - ISO-Initiated Claimed Capability Audits or that\nis in addition to required Market Participant-requested audits. An ISO decision\nto conduct such an audit shall be based upon objective criteria that suggest\nthat the Resource is claiming capability in excess of what the Resource’s\ntypical performance would indicate. Such criteria include, but are not limited\nto any of the following conditions:\n\na. A consistent pattern of declaring an Economic Maximum Limit or Maximum\n\nReduction, adjusted for ambient temperature as appropriate, that is\ninconsistent with the SCC, Seasonal DR Audit value, and/or Capacity\nSupply Obligation (CSO)\n\nb. Repeated failures of a resource to achieve its current SCC or Seasonal\n\nDRR Audit value during audits\n\nc. Repeated failures to meet Dispatch Instructions\n\n2. Resources are compensated for these audits in accordance with Section III of\n\nthe Tariff.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV.** **REACTIVE CAPABILITY AUDITS**\n\n**A. Verification of Reactive Power Capability**\n\n1. In accordance with the criteria described in Section III.1.5.3 (b) of the Tariff,\n\nISO, in consultation with the Local Control Centers (LCCs), shall determine\nwhich Reactive Resources shall be required to perform Reactive Capability\nAudits.\n\n2. Reactive Resources that are required to perform Reactive Capability Audits in\n\naccordance with Section III.1.5.3 (b) of the Tariff are listed in OP-23, Appendix\nG - Reactive Resources Required to Perform Reactive Capability Auditing\n(OP-23G).\n\n3. Each Reactive Resource owner shall verify the reactive power capability of a\n\nReactive Resource that is listed in OP-23G. Reactive Resource owners shall\nalso verify the reactive power capability of a Reactive Resource whenever\nsuch verification is otherwise required by ISO or the LCC.\n\n4. If the results of the Reactive Capability Audit demonstrate that the reactive\n\ncapability of a Reactive Resource is different than the reactive capability\nrequired under the Interconnection Agreement, then the Reactive Resource\nowner shall resolve the discrepancy in accordance with the Section I.3.9 of the\nTariff - Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans and, as appropriate,\nSchedule 22 (Large Generator Interconnection Procedures), Schedule 23\n(Small Generator Interconnection Procedures) or Schedule 25 (Elective\nTransmission Upgrade Interconnection Procedures) to the ISO’s Open Access\nTransmission Tariff.\n\n5. Resources that request to perform reactive capability testing other than that\n\nrequired by ISO shall request that testing using Section IV.D and IV.E of this\nOP.\n\n6. DRRs are not considered Reactive Resources by ISO.\n\n**B. Changes to the Reactive Capability of a Reactive Resource**\n\n1. ISO, in consultation with the LCC, shall determine whether a change to the\n\nreactive capability of the Reactive Resource, including a change to the size of\nthe storage capacity for an Electric Storage Facility (ESF), requires a new\nReactive Capability Audit for leading capability, lagging capability, or both.\n\n2. A Reactive Capability Audit that is required due to a change in reactive\n\ncapability shall be performed as soon as possible but no later than six (6)\nmonths from the date that the Market Participant (MP) was informed of the\nrequirement to audit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C. General Auditing Instructions Applicable to All Reactive Resources**\n\n**NOTE**\n\n  - Lagging (over-excited) capability is defined as the Reactive Resource\n\nproviding reactive power to the electrical system and is denoted as a positive\nvalue.\n\n  - Leading (under-excited) capability is defined as the Reactive Resource\n\nabsorbing reactive power from the electrical system and is denoted as a\nnegative value.\n\n1. The most recently performed Reactive Capability Audit shall be the audit of\n\nrecord for a Reactive Resource.\n\n2. Reactive Capability Audits for leading or lagging capability may be performed\n\nat any time during the year. Certain Reactive Resources may be required to\nperform Reactive Capability Audits at high or low loads due to the magnitude\nof the reactive capability required to be demonstrated during the audit. In the\nevent that a Reactive Resource requires certain conditions in order to\ndemonstrate its capability, ISO, the LCC, and the MP shall work together to\ndetermine an advantageous auditing window.\n\n3. Reactive Capability Audits shall be performed at least every five (5) years\n\nunless otherwise required by ISO or the LCC.\n\n4. Reactive Capability Audits for Reactive Resources listed in OP-23G shall be\n\nperformed by the end of the calendar year listed in OP-23G unless other\ndirection is provided by ISO (e.g., auditing following a reactive capability\nchange).\n\n5. Reactive Resources that will be listed in OP-23G but have not yet been\n\ndetermined ready to follow Real-Time dispatch by ISO are required to perform\nReactive Capability Audits prior to being determined ready to follow Real-Time\ndispatch, unless otherwise agreed to by ISO. ISO shall inform these Reactive\nResources of the auditing requirement through the ISO’s resource integration\nprocess.\n\n6. The Reactive Resource may perform real power or other required testing at\n\nthe same time as the Reactive Capability Audit so long as the requirements for\nreal and reactive power are met during the audit.\n\n7. During the Reactive Capability Audit, the Reactive Resource shall absorb or\n\nproduce the maximum reactive power of the Reactive Resource such that the\nReactive Resource reaches a defined limit, given the current conditions and\nlimitations, for the entire audit duration. This limit may be internal to the\nReactive Resource (e.g., maximum excitation limiters (MEL), under excitation\nlimiters (UEL), volts/hertz limiters, terminal voltage, procedural) or external to\nthe Reactive Resource (e.g., transmission bus voltage). The MP shall provide\nISO and the LCC the limit reached by the Reactive Resource during the audit,\non OP-23, Appendix I - Reactive Capability Audit Data Recording Form (OP\n\n-----\n\n23I). OP-23I shall be submitted to ISO by attaching the file to an Ask ISO\nissue.\n\n8. Unless otherwise directed by ISO or the LCC, Reactive Resources comprised\n\nof multiple dynamic devices (e.g., combined cycle, hydro, wind) shall perform\nReactive Capability Audits with at least 90% (rounded up) of the turbines or\ninverters at the Reactive Resource on-line. For example, a Generator Asset\ncomprised of 18 turbines would be required to have at least 17 turbines online\nat the time of the audit (i.e. 18 turbines*0.9 = 16.2 turbines; rounded up = 17\nturbines).\n\n9. In the event that reactive equipment or elements that may limit reactive\n\ncapability (e.g., transformers, feeders, etc.) are shared between multiple\nReactive Resources (e.g., pseudo-combined cycle assets, co-located solar\nand storage facilities), those Reactive Resources may be required to test at\nthe same time in order to determine limitations. This includes, but is not\nlimited to, machines at the same combined-cycle facility and Reactive\nResources that share the same interconnection transformer.\n\n10. The Reactive Resource shall have its Automatic Voltage Regulating\n\nequipment (AVR), including any limiting functions such as MEL, UEL, etc., in\nautomatic and controlling a voltage setpoint during the Reactive Capability\nAudit unless the technical capabilities of the Reactive Resource preclude\ntesting in this manner. If the AVR cannot be tested in automatic and\ncontrolling a voltage setpoint, then the Reactive Capability Audit Request shall\nstate the conditions of the AVR during testing. AVRs may include, but are not\nlimited to: synchronous generator AVRs, wind plant controllers, and\ndistributed control systems (DCSs).\n\n11. ISO, the LCC, and the Lead MP shall determine prior to the Reactive\n\nCapability Audit if any additional available data is required to be submitted with\nthe required OP-23I data.\n\n12. The Reactive Resource owner shall:\n\na. Record Reactive Capability Audit data at five (5) minute intervals and\n\nsubmit that data to ISO on OP-23I. All Reactive Capability Audit data\nrequired on OP-23I shall be submitted or ISO shall declare the Reactive\nCapability Audit to be invalid.\n\nb. Provide the status (in/out, etc.) and reactive loading for all reactive devices\n\n(e.g., capacitors, reactors, statcoms, etc.) at the Reactive Resource during\nthe Reactive Capability Audit on a five (5) minute basis. Such data shall\nbe provided to ISO with the Reactive Capability Audit data required in OP23I.\n\nc. Indicate on OP-23I which reactive device was most limiting (if the audited\n\nfacility is comprised of multiple reactive devices).\n\nd. Provide MW and MVAR values on the high and low side of the\n\ninterconnection transformer (if an interconnection transformer is installed\nand metering is available).\n\n\n-----\n\ne. Submit Reactive Capability Audit data to ISO within forty-five (45) days of\n\nthe date from which the data was obtained, for either a scheduled test or\nan operational data submission.\n\n13. ISO shall review the submitted Reactive Capability Audit data. ISO shall have\n\nthe ability to reject Reactive Capability Audit data that does not meet the\nauditing requirements, or cannot be corroborated through other data means.\n\n**D. Scheduling the Audit**\n\n1. Based upon studies or Real-Time conditions, ISO or the LCC shall have the\n\nability to approve, propose an alternate auditing time, deny, or cancel a\nReactive Capability Audit at any time prior to or during that audit.\n\n2. In order to perform a Reactive Capability Audit, the MP shall submit an outage\n\nrequest as prescribed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3) or a Reactive Capability Audit\nRequest as prescribed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 Resource Maintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSituations where fewer than five Business Days notice may be approved,\ninclude, but are not limited to, non-commercial testing of resources or ISOinitiated short notice operation of a resource that has yearly emissions or run\ntime limitations.\n\n3. The outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request:\n\na. Shall be submitted through the ISO outage scheduling software at least\n\nfive Business Days prior to the day of the Reactive Capability Audit.\n\nb. ISO and the LCC may agree to study an outage or Reactive Capability\n\nAudit Request that is submitted fewer than five Business Days prior to the\nday of the outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request. In order for an\noutage or Reactive Capability Audit Request to be considered with fewer\nthan five Business Days notice, the MP shall:.\n\ni. Consult with ISO and the LCC\n\nii. Receive verbal or written concurrence for fewer than five Business\n\nDays notice\n\niii. Submit the outage or Reactive Capability Audit Request to ISO\n\nprior to 1500 on the day prior to the day of the outage or Reactive\nCapability Audit Request\n\nc. Shall contain a completed OP-23, Appendix H - Reactive Capability Audit\n\nRequest Form (OP-23H).\n\n4. The LCC shall, at a minimum, conduct area studies for Reactive Capability\n\nAudit requests where the combined output or absorption of all concurrently\nauditing Reactive Resources is greater than 10 MVAR. The study shall,\n\n\n-----\n\nrespecting pre- and post-contingent voltage limits to maintain reliability,\ndetermine the maximum level of reactive output or absorption that can be\nachieved up to the requested reactive value during the requested audit time\nand date while performing all normal voltage control actions, and document\nthe achievable output level and required actions on the audit request.\n\n5. The LCC shall approve the audit request if either:\n\na. The requested output or absorption for all concurrently auditing Reactive\n\nResources is less than or equal to 10 MVAR, or\n\nb. The study determines that the Reactive Resource(s) can achieve:\n\ni. Greater than 80% of the requested reactive output value, for a\n\nReactive Resource that has greater than or equal to a 30 MVA\nnameplate capability, or\n\nii. Within 2 MVAR of the requested output value for a Reactive Resource\n\nthat has less than a 30 MVA nameplate capability.\n\n6. If the LCC study determines that the Reactive Resource would be unable to\n\nachieve the specified reactive power levels in Section IV.D.5 of this procedure,\nthe LCC shall confer with ISO and determine if the audit request shall be\ndenied or rescheduled.\n\n7. ISO shall, at a minimum, conduct area studies for Reactive Capability Audit\n\nrequests where the combined output or absorption of all auditing Reactive\nResources is greater than 10 MVAR. The study shall, respecting pre- and\npost-contingent voltage and stability limits to maintain reliability, determine the\nmaximum level of reactive output or absorption that can be achieved during\nthe requested audit time and date while performing all normal voltage control\nactions and document the achievable output level and required actions on the\naudit request. ISO shall approve or deny the Reactive Capability Audit\nrequest based upon these studies. ISO shall confer with the LCC prior to\ndenying an audit request that was previously approved by the LCC.\n\n8. In the event that ISO or the LCC deny the Reactive Capability Audit, a reason\n\nfor denial, subject to the ISO New England Information Policy (Attachment D\nto the Tariff), shall be provided along with any necessary parameters (e.g.,\nNew England load level) that shall be met in order to conduct the Reactive\nCapability Audit.\n\n**E. Requesting Permission to Perform the Audit in Real-Time**\n\n1. The MP or DE shall submit Supply Offers to ensure that the Reactive\n\nResource is dispatched to the appropriate MW level for the Reactive\nCapability Audit, including any ramp time.\n\n2. After the Reactive Capability Audit has been scheduled as detailed in Section\n\nIV.D, on the scheduled date and time of the Reactive Capability Audit:\n\na. The DE or Transmission Operator shall request permission from the ISO\n\ncontrol room to conduct the Reactive Capability Audit.\n\n\n-----\n\nb. The LCC and ISO shall study and approve or deny the Reactive Capability\n\nAudit in Real-Time.\n\nc. The LCC shall provide the Reactive Resource operator with any additional\n\nmaximum and minimum voltage limits that are applicable during the\nReactive Capability Audit.\n\nd. The LCC shall adjust system voltage prior to the Reactive Capability Audit\n\nas follows:\n\ni. For a leading Reactive Capability Audit, the LCC shall (to the best of\n\nits ability) adjust system voltage at the Reactive Resource’s\ninterconnection point in order to achieve voltage in the high end of the\ntolerance band (or near the voltage schedule maximum for those\nReactive Resources with no tolerance band provided) prior to\nallowing the start of the Reactive Capability Audit.\n\nii. For a lagging Reactive Capability Audit, the LCC shall (to the best of\n\nits ability) adjust system voltage at the Reactive Resource’s\ninterconnection point in order to achieve voltage in the low end of the\ntolerance band (or near the voltage schedule minimum for those\nReactive Resources with no tolerance band provided) prior to\nallowing the start of the Reactive Capability Audit.\n\n**F.

This is\nacceptable during the Lagging Reactive Capability Audit.\n\n\n-----\n\na. Voltage Requirements:\n\ni. The station voltage which the Reactive Resource normally controls\n\nshall be above the tolerance band kV low (or above the voltage\nschedule minimum for those Reactive Resources with no tolerance\nband provided) and below the maximum allowable station voltage for\nthe entire period during which the lagging Reactive Capability Audit\nis conducted.\n\nb. Real Power Requirements:\n\ni. CSC shall perform its lagging Reactive Capability Audit of the\n\nHalvarsson converter terminal during hours in which the CSC is\nscheduled at its full MW transfer loading in the southward direction.\nCSC full MW transfer loading in the southward direction is achieved\nwhen the total net sum of external transactions submitted by MPs\nand scheduled by ISO in the ISO Real-Time Energy Market at the\nCSC external node [.I.SHOREHAM138 99 (Location ID 4014)]\nresults in 330 MW of energy flowing from New England to New\nYork.\n\nii. Synchronous Condensers and Flexible Alternating Current\n\nTransmission System (FACTS) devices shall be consuming normal\nreal power consumption levels.\n\niii. Continuous Storage DARDs shall be consuming within 5% or 2 MW\n\n(whichever is greater) of 90% of the associated Continuous Storage\nGenerator Asset summer NRC, applied in the consuming direction,\nfor the entire duration of the Reactive Capability Audit with at least\n90% (rounded up) of the energy conversion equipment (e.g. inverters\nand batteries) in service.\n\niv. Binary Storage DARDs shall be consuming at the maximum\n\nconsumption level achievable during the entire duration of the\nReactive Capability Audit with at least 90% (rounded up) of the\nenergy conversion equipment (e.g. inverters or turbines) in service.\n\n**H. Operational Data in Lieu of an Audit**\n\n1. Operational data that meets the requirements of the applicable Reactive\n\nCapability Audit may be submitted in lieu of performing a scheduled Reactive\nCapability Audit.\n\n**I. Reactive Capability Audit Waivers**\n\n1. The Lead MP may request a waiver from performing a required Reactive\n\nCapability Audit to full reactive capability by completing and submitting OP-23,\nAppendix J - Reactive Capability Audit Waiver Request Form (OP-23J) to\nmvarcaptest@iso-ne.com. A demonstration of the maximum achievable\nreactive capability of the Reactive Resource for the full duration of a Reactive\nCapability Audit is required prior to requesting a waiver unless the Reactive\nResource is on an extended outage. ISO shall not consider valid Reactive\n\n\n-----\n\nCapability Audits that are not completed for their full duration because of a\nReal-Time contingency. Operational data may not be used to satisfy the\nrequirement to perform testing prior to requesting a waiver.\n\n2. ISO, in consultation with the LCC, may grant a waiver for a Reactive Resource\n\nthat is not capable of performing a Reactive Capability Audit because of:\n\na. Transmission conditions or outages that limit the Reactive Resource from\n\nachieving full reactive capability during the Reactive Capability Audit;\n\nb. An extended outage; or\n\nc. Real-Time contingencies that prevented more than one (1) Reactive\n\nCapability Audit from being completed successfully for the full duration of\nthe audit.\n\n3. ISO, in consultation with the LCC, shall determine whether or not to grant a\n\nwaiver for the Reactive Capability Audit and, based upon the circumstances\njustifying the waiver, the length of the waiver.\n\n4. In the event that the conditions justifying the waiver change during the waiver\n\nperiod, ISO may require a Reactive Capability Audit from the Reactive\nResource that was granted the waiver.\n\n5. Granted waivers shall be effective for one (1) year starting on the first of\n\nJanuary following the year when testing was required.\n\n6. Waivers for Reactive Capability Audits that apply to the Schedule 2 Capacity\n\nCost Compensation Program shall be issued in accordance with the ISO New\nEngland Schedule 2 Business Procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**V.** **DUAL-FUEL GENERATOR ASSET CAPABILITY AUDITS**\n\nA. A Generator Asset that has indicated that it is capable of operating on multiple\n\nfuels on the ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical\nRequirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related\nDemands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), Appendix\nA - Explanation of Terms and Instructions for Data Preparation of ISO New\nEngland Form NX-12, Generator Technical Data form (OP-14 NX-12 form) may\nbe required to audit on a specific fuel. ISO retains the right to require a dual-fuel\nGenerator Asset capability audit at any time if it determines that there is a\nreliability need. The following guidance is provided for an on-going audit process\nof dual-fuel Generator Asset capability.\n\nB. Each year, ISO shall:\n\n1. Determine the current list of dual-fuel Generator Assets\n\n2. Evaluate the list of dual-fuel Generator Assets in order to determine the list of\n\ndual-fuel Generator Assets that will be required to perform an audit before\n\na. November 30 of that year. In this determination, ISO may consider Generator\n\nAsset parameters including, but not limited to, the operating history of those\ndual-fuel Assets and the fuels indicated as primary and alternate\n\nb. [3. Notify Lead MPs by September 30 of any dual-fuel audits that are due by ]\n\nNovember 30 of that year\n\n\nC. The Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset shall respond to any data\n\nrequests from ISO regarding fuel usage and operating history for this analysis.\n\nD.

The Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset may provide ISO with operational\n\ndata, obtained after the previous December 1, that shows that the dual-fuel\nGenerator Asset has met these audit parameters.\n\nG. ISO shall take into account any operational data provided by the Lead MP for the\n\ndual-fuel Generator Asset when determining the dual-fuel Generator Assets that\nare required to perform a dual-fuel Generator Asset capability audit.\n\nH. The dual-fuel Generator Asset Lead MP shall create and submit an audit plan to\n\nISO, including opportune dates for testing.\n\n\n-----\n\nI. ISO and the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset shall agree on testing\n\nparameters and date for the audit. ISO shall take into account reliability and\neconomic factors when working with the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator\nAsset to determine the auditing date.\n\nJ. The Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset may submit data that meets the\n\naudit parameters without previously scheduling the testing if the dual-fuel\nGenerator Asset is otherwise committed and performs the testing.\n\nK. At the conclusion of the testing, the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset\n\nshall submit the following data to ISO for evaluation:\n\n1. Time commenced startup or fuel swap;\n\n2. Time synchronized on the specified fuel (as applicable);\n\n3. Time fuel swap started (as applicable);\n\n4. Time fuel swap completed (as applicable);\n\n5. MW value reduced/raised to during fuel swap (as applicable);\n\n6. Time reached maximum output;\n\n7. Time completed operating at maximum output; and\n\n8. Average output over the maximum output audit period.\n\nL. Upon review of the submitted data and in consultation with the Lead MP for the\n\ndual-fuel Generator Asset, ISO shall determine if the dual-fuel Generator Asset\nsuccessfully completed the audit.\n\n1. If the audit was not successful:\n\na. The Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset may elect to remove the\n\ndual-fuel capability from the OP-14 NX-12 form until such time as\noperation on the specific fuel can be verified.\n\nb. If the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator Asset does not elect to modify\n\nthe OP-14 NX-12 form, then the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator\nAsset shall provide a plan to ISO describing the actions and timeline for\nresolving any issues with the audit.\n\nM. Upon completion of the restoration plan, the Lead MP for the dual-fuel Generator\n\nAsset may be required to perform another fuel-specific audit as prescribed by\nISO pursuant to Section V. of this OP.\n\nN. Every year, ISO shall provide a report to the Reliability Committee, stating the\n\nnumber of dual-fuel Generator Assets and total summer SCC of the Generator\nAssets that will be required to perform these dual-fuel capability audits during the\ntesting period.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OP-23 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History:**\n\n|Document|History:|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Rev.

This increased duty has resulted in greater power\nsystem sensitivity to faults, losses of equipment, and/or equipment malfunctions.\nAccordingly, it is essential that power system behavior be carefully analyzed\nfollowing abnormal operations. These operations include not only severe system\ndisturbances, but also incidents that fall into the \"near miss\" or abnormal (versus\nemergency) category.\n\nThis Procedure establishes responsibilities for conducting analyses of power\nsystem incidents, including abnormal events, system conditions or disturbances\nthat impact the reliability of the BES as well as physical, cyber and communication\nsystem sabotage / attack events. This Procedure also establishes responsibilities\nfor the distribution of reports resulting from such analyses. The reports resulting\nfrom these analyses may also be used to fulfill the reporting requirements of the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE), state regulatory bodies, the Northeast Power\nCoordinating Council Inc. (NPCC), and the North American Electric Reliability\nCorporation (NERC), as applicable.\n\n**II.** **EVENTS REQUIRING ANALYSES AND REPORTS**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nReporting of emergency incident and disturbance events by ISO New England\n(ISO), Market Participants (MPs), Local Control Centers (LCCs) and Transmission\nOwners (TOs) to DOE, NERC and NPCC is performed in accordance with\napplicable NERC Reliability Standards, NPCC Procedures and in accordance with\nthe process detailed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 10 Emergency Incident and Disturbance Notifications (OP-10).\n\nISO, considering input that may be provided by LCCs, TOs, MPs, and NPCC, will\ndetermine whether it will conduct an analysis and prepare a report for the following\ntypes of power system incidents:\n\n1. Incidents that are reported to DOE, NERC, and NPCC, including but not\n\nlimited to:\n\na. System events resulting in system frequency excursions below the\n\ninitializing set points of the Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS)\nprogram, as described in NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding\n\nb. Disturbances or unusual occurrences that jeopardize the operation of the\n\nBES, or result in system equipment damage or customer interruptions,\nas described in NERC Reliability Standard EOP-004 - Event Reporting\n(EOP-004)\n\nc. Unforeseen failures of ISO critical operating tool(s), as described in\n\nEOP-004\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Incidents involving the successful or unsuccessful operation of a special\n\nrelay protection system listed in the NPCC RAS SPS List Guide.\n\n3. Incidents that, in the judgment of the Master/Local Control Center Heads\n\n(M/LCC Heads), warrant review and analysis. These include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\n    - Prolonged (sustained) oscillations\n\n   - Severe voltage excursions\n\n    - Multiple and simultaneous loss of large generators and/or transmission\n\nsystem elements\n\n    - Loss of significant customer load\n\n4. Incidents that ISO determines must be analyzed for NERC Reliability\n\nStandard MOD-033 - Steady-State and Dynamic System Model Validation\n(MOD-033) to compare simulations using planning model cases to RealTime system performance\n\n**A. CONDUCTING ANALYSES AND DEVELOPING AND DISTRIBUTING REPORTS**\n\n1. Responsibilities;\n\n   - ISO is responsible for determining the need to conduct analyses and\n\nprepare reports of power system incidents.

This protocol identifies the mechanisms to be used\nshould ISO-NE need the assistance of any regional natural gas company(s) to help mitigate\nelectric power grid operating emergencies and/or other abnormal conditions jeopardizing the\nreliability of New England’s electric power system. The reciprocal is true of the regional natural\ngas industry. This protocol was first developed in 2004 and is regularly reviewed and updated\nby ISO-NE, NGA and NGA’s member companies.\n\n**_Regular Information Flow_**\n\nOngoing communication is expected to occur between the electric and natural gas industries on a\ndaily basis as part of their regular business processes. For example, regular communications\noccur between ISO-NE and electric generators interconnected with the regional transmission\nsystem and communications also occurs between those generators, specifically gas-fired\ngenerators, with their corresponding transportation service providers (TSP), i.e. the operating\npersonnel of interstate or intrastate pipelines, local gas distribution companies (LDCs), and other\nnatural gas suppliers. Communication may also occur between ISO-NE and the operating\npersonnel of an interstate natural gas pipeline company.\n\nIt is anticipated that most issues or events will be mitigated through this regular information\nflow, which are in place to support their bilateral and contractual arrangements (ISO to\ngenerator, generator to pipeline, ISO-NE to pipeline).\n\nIf conditions on either the regional electric power system or the regional natural gas grid are\nconsidered abnormal (i.e., severe weather, capacity deficiencies, energy emergencies,\ninfrastructure failures, etc.), and these conditions are either declared in real-time or projected\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nwithin a forecast, then the potential exists for additional or enhanced electric/gas\ncommunications.\n\nThe communications described in this Operating Procedure will take place as needed (i.e. more\nthan once) to ascertain the level of knowledge and understanding concerning system status,\nproblem duration, and identification of remedial activities or mitigation methods.\n\nISO-NE may contact any regional gas delivery entity (and vice versa) anytime it has questions\nregarding real-time or forecast conditions of the natural gas system or electric power system.\nNatural gas delivery entities may also contact NGA regarding any key developments or\nregarding any prior communications they have had with ISO-NE. The status of individual\ninterstate pipelines is routinely posted on their electronic bulletin boards (EBB). The\ninformation requested by ISO-NE and subsequently provided by the natural gas company (and\nvice versa) may be of any level of classification (e.g. confidential information) provided that the\nreceiving party agrees that such information will be handled in accordance with the requirements\nof FERC Order No. 787***. Confidential information regarding specific generators will be\nshared only with the pipeline serving that generator directly and ISO-NE has determined that it is\noperationally necessary to ensure reliability to disclose the confidential information. The\ninformation discussed will also comply with NGA’s and the gas industry’s anti-trust and market\nconfidentiality contractual agreements.\n\nAnother mechanism for industry coordination is the Electric/Gas Operations Committee\n(EGOC). The EGOC was jointly established by ISO-NE and NGA in 2004. It is comprised of\nrepresentatives of the electric and natural gas delivery systems in the northeast; ISO-NE, on\nbehalf of the bulk electric power industry, and NGA (interstate pipeline companies, the regional\nLNG importer, and local gas distribution companies), on behalf of the regional natural gas\nindustry. The EGOC is jointly administered by ISO-NE and NGA. Throughout the year, the\nEGOC convenes on a periodic basis, through meetings and conference calls. The EGOC’s\npurpose is to provide a forum for electric and natural gas representatives to learn more about\neach other’s systems and share information on system operations, planning and procedures. The\nmeetings and information-sharing abide by each industry’s antitrust and information policies and\nonly address publicly-available information. Meeting minutes are approved and publicly\navailable.\n\n**_Real-Time Communications_**\n\nIf the electric power system is currently experiencing an abnormal event or an event projected to\noccur near-term, or should there be a gas delivery interruption that would potentially impact fuel\ndeliveries to gas-fired generating units, or even a projection of extreme weather, the level of\ncoordination between the electric and gas industries will likely increase. ISO-NE has several\nprocedures that, when implemented, may require increased communications between both\nparties:\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n1) Master/Local Control Center Procedure No.2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert (M/LCC2)\n2) Operating Procedure No. 4 – Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4).\n3) Operating Procedure No. 7 – Actions in an Emergency (OP-7).\n4) Operating Procedure No. 21 – Energy Inventory Accounting and Actions During an\n\nEnergy Emergency (OP-21).\n\n5) SOP-RTMKTS.0050.0007 - Perform Cold Weather Condition Operations\n\nThe regional gas pipelines and LDCs also have procedures that, when implemented, may\ncontemplate increased communications between both parties (i.e. Critical and Non-Critical\nNotices). The interstate pipelines post relevant information on their EBBs. Interstate pipeline\ninformation may be accessed through the Informational Postings section of their EBBs. Relevant\ninformation includes both Critical and Non-Critical notices as well as Planned Service Outages\nand available capacity. If a gas supply situation emerges that has implications for the Northeast,\na NGA member company can request that NGA convene its Gas Supply Task Force (GSTF) to\nassess the situation and consider remedial actions that may be taken by GSTF members to\nalleviate the situation. NGA will institute the procedures outlined in its GSTF charter.\n\n**_One-Company To One-Company Communications_**\n\nIf either entity, the electric power grid or a natural gas pipeline/LDC is experiencing abnormal\nsystem conditions, information will be shared on a one-company to one-company basis, either\nthrough an initial telephone call, an email message, or posting of relevant information on a\nrespective web site or electronic bulletin board. (e.g. ISO-NE Control Room to individual\npipelines). Some interstate pipelines also offer subscription services that allow users to subscribe\nto e-mail messages for Critical and Non-Critical notices to be sent electronically to email\ninboxes.\n\n**_Communication Between ISO-NE And NGA_**\n\nNGA administers a long-established committee of gas supply officials through its Gas Supply\nTask Force (GSTF). The GSTF is comprised of representatives from the major LDCs in the\nNortheast, as well as from all the regional interstate pipelines and the regional LNG supplier.\nThe GSTF was established to monitor and assess any regional gas supply or deliverability issue\nconcerning the natural gas system in the greater Northeast. The GSTF may also be convened to\naddress other non-regional issues, that may have the potential to impact the Northeast (i.e. gulf\ncoast hurricanes damaging oil and gas infrastructure). The GSTF abides by NGA’s anti-trust\nguidelines in all its deliberations. Via telephone or email message, NGA will debrief ISO-NE of\nall meetings of the GSTF, as it also does for officials of state public utility commissions and\nenergy agencies serving the northeast region. NGA has served as a liaison (conduit) between\nISO-NE and the GSTF in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n**_Industry Contact And Coordination During Non-Business Hours_**\n\nShould an emergency situation develop during non-business hours, i.e. in the middle of the night\nor a weekend, the primary contact will be between the control rooms of the electric grid operator\n(ISO-NE) and the natural gas pipeline(s) or LDCs. NGA has included contact information for\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nISO-NE and the New York ISO (NYISO) within their update to their emergency communication\nmanual entitled, “Gas Supply Information for the Northeast Gas Industry,” as published annually\nby the GSTF of NGA. This contact information can be used by any entity to contact the other.\n\n*ISO New England is the independent, not-for-profit corporation responsible for the reliable operation of New\nEngland’s electric power generation and transmission system, overseeing and ensuring the fair administration of the\nregion’s wholesale electricity markets, and managing comprehensive regional electric transmission planning\n[process. Reference ISO-NE’s web site located at: http://www.iso-ne.com.](http://www.iso-ne.com/)\n\n** The Northeast Gas Association (NGA) is a regional trade association that focuses on education and training,\ntechnology research and development, operations, planning, and increasing public awareness of natural gas in the\nNortheast U.S. NGA represents natural gas distribution companies, transmission companies, liquefied natural gas\nimporters, and associate member companies. These companies provide natural gas to over 12 million customers in\nnine states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode\nIsland and Vermont). NGA was established on January 1, 2003. Its predecessor organizations were The New\nEngland Gas Association (founded in 1926) and the New York Gas Group (founded in 1973).

PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to identify examples of Extreme Contingencies not addressed by the NORMAL or EMERGENCY System Contingency criteria of OP-19; these contingencies are not respected for Real-Time operations except by specific exception when determined by analysis.\n\n 1. Examples of Extreme Contingencies\n\n A. Loss of the entire capability of a generating station.\n\n B. Loss of all transmission circuits emanating from a generating station, switching\n station, DC terminal or substation.\n\n C. Loss of all transmission circuits on a common right-of-way.\n\n D. Permanent three-phase fault on any generator, transmission circuit,\n transformer or bus section, with delayed clearing and with due regard to reclosing. This delayed clearing could be due to circuit breaker, relay system or signal channel malfunction.\n\n E. The sudden dropping of a large load or major load center.\n\n F. The effect of severe power swings arising from disturbances outside of the\n NPCC interconnected systems.\n\n G. The operation or partial operation of a RAS/ACS for an event or condition for\n which it was not intended to operate.\n\n H. Sudden loss of fuel delivery system to multiple generating stations (i.e., gas\n pipeline contingencies, including both gas transmission lines and gas mains).\n\n\n-----\n\n### OP-19 APPENDIX E REVISION HISTORY\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the**\nRTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations\nDate.)\n\n|Rev.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Operating Procedure (OP) documents the processes, and establishes the\nassociated requirements for ISO New England Inc. (ISO) to:\n\n1. Collect fuel availability and environmental limitation information for each coal, oil,\n\nnatural-gas fired, and any other Resources that ISO determines to be necessary\n\n[referred to as “applicable Resource(s)” for the purposes of this OP] from each\nrespective Lead Market Participant (Lead MP);\n\n2. Forecast and report on expected energy availability over a 21-day look-ahead\n\nperiod;\n\n3. Declare Energy Alerts and Energy Emergencies based on forecasted or Real-Time\n\nsystem conditions;\n\n4. Take appropriate action in anticipation of, or during, an Energy Alert or Energy\n\nEmergency;\n\n5. Communicate with interstate natural gas pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)\n\nimport facilities, local gas distribution companies (LDCs), Designated Entities\n(DEs), and Lead MPs regarding all matters related to Resource fuel availability\nand environmental limitations;\n\n6. Collect information related to winter readiness preparations from each Generator\n\nAsset;\n\n7. Collect information related to natural gas pipeline system critical infrastructure.\n\nThis OP also documents the responsibilities of Lead MPs of applicable Resources for\ncompletion of periodic surveys, related communications and reporting requirements, and\nexpectations for responses related to an ISO declaration of an Energy Alert or an Energy\nEmergency. Nothing in this OP shall relieve Lead MPs from their obligations under the\nTariff.\n\nEnergy Emergencies (defined in Section III.C of this OP) may occur at any time as a\nresult of sustained national or regional shortages in fuel availability or deliverability to\nNew England’s Resources. Such shortages of fuel may occur in many forms, including,\nbut not limited to: severe drought, interruption to availability or transportation of natural\ngas, oil, or coal.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRevision 9, Effective Date: October 19, 2023 Page 3 of 24\n\n\n-----\n\nReporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency\n\nAny of the conditions listed below, or a combination of these conditions, may contribute to\nan Energy Emergency (this is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of possible initiating\nconditions):\n```\n  o One or more pipeline operational flow orders (OFOs) have been declared\n  o Significant reductions of Resource capability due to natural gas-related issues\n  o Weather forecast for an extended period of cold or hot weather\n  o Fuel delivery to a significant number of fossil fuel-fired generating Resources is, or\n\n```\nmay be, impaired\n```\n  o Prolonged drought\n  o Adverse weather conditions within the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada, or\n\n```\nregional shale gas basins\n```\n  o Abnormal conditions at regional LNG import, satellite storage, or LNG trucking\n\n```\nfacilities\n```\n  o Extremely cold regional, national, or international weather conditions\n  o Extreme storm conditions off-shore in the Maritimes\n  o Any viable threat to one or more of the interstate natural gas pipelines or LDCs\n\n```\nsupplying New England\n```\n  o Prolonged, significant reductions of capability to import power into the New\n\n```\nEngland region\n```\n  o Any other serious threat to the integrity of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for which\n\n```\nISO determines that the actions of this OP may mitigate the impact\n\nA sustained environmental limitation on some, or several, of New England’s Resources\nmay also contribute to an Energy Emergency.\n\nEnergy Emergencies are envisioned to last much longer than capacity deficiencies, which\nare managed through ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Actions During a\nCapacity Deficiency (OP-4) and, under extreme circumstances, through ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 7 - Actions in an Emergency (OP-7). Operable\ncapacity deficiencies are typically experienced at seasonal peak load conditions or upon\nthe occurrence of other emergent system conditions and tend to last for a few hours per\nevent. Because fuel shortages and/or environmental limitations may impact New\nEngland’s ability to fully meet system load and Ten-Minute Reserve Requirements for\ndays, weeks, or months at a time, ISO may need to take action in advance of a projected\nEnergy Emergency to manage and preserve fuel supplies within the region. Unless ISO\ntakes action to address projected Energy Emergencies, a fuel shortage and/or\nenvironmental limitations may lead to a significant loss of Resource capacity and more\nextreme use of OP-4 and OP-7 actions.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRevision 9, Effective Date: October 19, 2023 Page 4 of 24\n\n\n-----\n\nReporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency\n\nThe objectives of this OP are:\n\n1. To facilitate strong lines of communication among ISO, interstate natural gas\n\npipelines, LNG import facilities, LDCs, DEs, and Lead MPs regarding all matters\nrelating to Resource fuel availability and environmental limitations\n\n2. To facilitate identification of critical infrastructure of the interstate natural gas\n\npipeline system in order to ensure critical components are not included in\nautomatic or manual load shed schemes\n\n3. To alert regional stakeholders of actual or anticipated near-term energy deficiency\n\nconditions such that stakeholders with Resources in short supply of fuel, or with\npotential environmental limitations, can take action to replenish fuel supplies\nand/or take action to mitigate environmental limitations;\n\n4. To alert regional stakeholders of potential energy deficiencies such that they may\n\ntake action to shorten or reschedule maintenance or repair to transmission\nfacilities or Resources throughout the region;\n\n5. To raise the awareness of New England consumers, Lead MPs, officials of the\n\nNew England states, regional and national regulators, and regional and national\nreliability organizations of potential energy deficiencies that may be faced by the\nregion;\n\n6. To allow for timely implementation of load and capacity relief available within\n\nactions of OP-4 or through implementation of load shedding through OP-7, in\norder to address future capacity deficiencies expected as a result of an Energy\nEmergency.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRevision 9, Effective Date: October 19, 2023 Page 5 of 24\n\n\n-----\n\nReporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency\n\n## II. ENERGY EMERGENCY FORECASTING AND REPORTING OVERVIEW\n\n**A. ENERGY EMERGENCY FORECASTING AND REPORTING PROCESS**\n\n**DESCRIPTION AND FORECAST ALERT THRESHOLDS**\n\nISO shall perform Energy Emergency forecasting and reporting based on available\ndata that includes the information received from Lead MPs through the Generator\nFuel and Emissions Survey submittals. Energy Emergency forecasting and\nreporting is performed at the periodicity specified in Sections III.A, III.B, and III.C.\nISO performs Energy Emergency forecasting and reporting by using an hourly 21day energy assessment, and comparing the results of that assessment with the\nEnergy Emergency forecast alert thresholds (described below) in order to identify\nand communicate potential reliability issues to regional stakeholders.\n\nThe Energy Emergency forecasts are non-binding as forecasted or expected\nconditions utilized in the development of the forecasts can change. It is the\nresponsibility of the Lead MP to take all actions to ensure that Resources are able\nto meet applicable obligations under the Tariff.\n\n**Energy Emergency Forecast Alert Thresholds**\n```\n       o Forecast MLCC 2 (FMLCC2) – indicates that available Resources during any\n\n```\nhour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less than 200 MW above\nthose required to meet Operating Reserve requirements.\n```\n       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 (FEEA1) – indicates that available\n\n```\nResources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less\nthan those required to meet Operating Reserve requirements, and that the\nimplementation of OP-4 Actions 1 through 5 is being forecasted.\n```\n       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 2 (FEEA2) – indicates that available\n\n```\nResources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be less\nthan those required to meet Operating Reserve requirements and that the\nimplementation of OP-4 Actions 6 through 11 is being forecasted.\n```\n       o Forecast Energy Emergency Alert Level 3 (FEEA3) – indicates that available\n\n```\nResources during any hour of the Operating Day are forecasted to be\ninsufficient to serve firm load requirements, and the implementation of firm\nload shedding under OP-7 is being forecasted.\n\nISO shall identify and report each hour of all Operating Days within the 21-day look\nahead of the Energy Emergency forecast as one of the following: normal, FMLCC2,\nFEEA1, FEEA2, or FEEA3.\n\nISO shall publish the results of each Energy Emergency forecast on the ISO\nwebsite.

NATURAL GAS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SURVEY\n\nTo ensure that the critical infrastructure of the interstate natural gas system are not\nserved by electrical transmission or distribution circuits that may be subject to automatic\nor manual load-shedding schemes, ISO shall annually perform a Natural Gas Critical\nInfrastructure Survey.\n\n**A. SURVEY PROCESS**\n\nAnnually, ISO shall distribute a survey to representatives of each interstate natural gas\npipeline company operating within New England as well as the Canaport LNG facility\nlocated in Saint John, New Brunswick, CA and the Everett LNG facility in Everett, MA.\n\nEach applicable representative should complete the survey by compiling a list of its\ncritical facilities. Critical facilities,[2] for the purposes of this survey, include infrastructure\nthat is critical to the reliable flow of natural gas to customers, including natural gas-fired\ngenerating facilities and thereby requires a supply from the electrical grid to maintain\noperations.\n\nISO may modify the survey questions, as necessary, if it determines that additional\ninformation is needed to accomplish the objectives of the Natural Gas Critical\nInfrastructure Survey process, as described above.\n\nISO shall forward completed surveys to the applicable Local Control Center(s) to\nfacilitate a review of load shedding procedures, schemes, and circuits to verify that\nnatural gas infrastructure deemed to be critical is not connected to or located on any\npredefined electrical circuits.\n\n**B. SURVEY QUESTIONS**\n\nThe following data points are requested for each component identified to be a critical\nfacility:\n\n1. Physical address of component\n2. Applicable meter number\n3. Feeder name/number (if known)\n\n**C. DATA RETENTION REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING**\n\nISO shall retain all data submitted in response to Natural Gas Critical Infrastructure\nSurveys for not less than 36 months.\n\n2 Examples of critical facilities, for the purposes of this survey, includes, but is not limited to; LNG\nliquefaction/vaporization facilities, control centers, gate stations, pipeline compressor stations, and other\ncomponents/facilities deemed critical to operations by each pipeline or facility\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRevision 9, Effective Date: October 19, 2023 Page 23 of 24\n\n\n-----\n\nReporting and Actions During an Energy Emergency\n\n## OP-21 REVISION HISTORY\n\n**Rev.

Prescribed operator actions\nare further detailed in several ISO New England (ISO) Transmission Operating\nGuides.\n\nThe provisions of this OP are used to determine data, methods, and limits for\noperation of the New England Transmission System. ISO, as the System\nOperator, is responsible for, among other things, matters pertaining to the central\ndispatch of each transmission facility over which it has operational control\npursuant to the Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA). ISO is responsible for\noperating all transmission facilities rated 115 kV and above. Local Control\nCenters (LCCs) are responsible for operating all transmission facilities rated 69\nkV and below. LCCs have exclusive operating responsibility for all 69 kV facilities\nwith the exception of certain facilities listed in Master / Local Control Center\nProcedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment F (M/LCC\n15F), List of 69kV Facilities Currently Under ISO-NE Operational Control. The\nNew England Transmission System is defined in the ISO New England\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and includes the Reliability\nCoordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA),[1] Bulk Electric System,[2]\nand bulk power system elements found within New England on the transmission\nnetwork.\n\nThis OP describes how ISO and each LCC plan to operate within all System\nOperating Limits (SOLs) and Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits (IROLs).\n\n**A. Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this OP is to describe how each Transmission Owner (TO), the\nISO, and each LCC [as Transmission Operators (TOP-)[3]]:\n\n      - Monitor the New England Transmission System and determine ratings,\n\ncriteria and limits for their operation under NORMAL and EMERGENCY\nsystem conditions.\n\n     - Analyze and operate the New England Transmission System under those\n\ntwo categories of system conditions.\n\nThis OP provides for the reliability of the New England Transmission System and\naddresses the execution and coordination of activities that impact inter- and intraregional reliability, including:\n\n      - Monitoring and controlling voltage levels and real / reactive power flows\n\n      - Switching transmission elements\n\n      - Planned outages, including outages of protection systems\n\n1 RCA/BAA are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n2 Bulk Electric System is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n3 Transmission Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\n     - Responding to IROL and SOL exceedances\n\n**II.** **RELIABILITY RATINGS, CRITERIA AND LIMITS FOR TRANSMISSION**\n**OPERATIONS**\n\n**A. Background**\n\nISO operates the New England Transmission System to account for\ncontingencies. A contingency is the unexpected failure or outage of a system\ncomponent such as a generator, transmission line, circuit breaker, switch or other\nelectrical element. The New England Transmission System is operated reliably to\navoid adverse impacts, pre-contingency, and after single-element and certain\nmultiple-element contingencies. Adverse impacts may include, but are not limited\nto:\n\n     - Equipment damage due to thermal overload\n\n     - Cascading thermal overloads\n\n     - Excessively high or low voltage or voltage collapse\n\n      - Unit or area instability\n\n     - Unacceptable post-transient voltage sag\n\n     - Uncontrolled system separation\n\n     - Unacceptable damping\n\nA single contingency may result in the loss of one or more elements. Single\ncontingencies within the New England RCA/BAA shall not result in a violation of\nthe operating reliability criteria of another RCA/BAA. Loss of small portions of the\nNew England Transmission System (such as radial portions) may be tolerated\nprovided they do not jeopardize the reliability of the remaining New England\nTransmission System and the Interconnection.[4]\n\nThis OP includes specific definitions, ratings, limits, and criteria for two categories\nof system conditions (NORMAL and EMERGENCY), as well as two associated\nlevels of transmission transfer capabilities for the New England Transmission\nSystem. During NORMAL system conditions, a higher level of prescribed\nreliability is maintained. During EMERGENCY system conditions, a lower level of\nreliability is permitted to allow for increased operating flexibility.\n\nFor the purposes of this OP, “facility ratings” are the maximum or minimum\nvoltage, current, frequency, or real or reactive power flow through a facility that\ndoes not violate the applicable equipment rating of any equipment comprising the\nfacility. “Facility ratings” and “ratings” are used interchangeably throughout this\nOP. Facility ratings are provided by each TO.\n\nFor the purposes of this OP, “facility limits” or “limits” are the ratings used for\nfacilities in system operations. For example, a TO may offer a facility thermal\n\n4 Interconnection is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nrating for a transmission line, but once the thermal rating is put into use by the\nTOP, that facility rating becomes a facility limit. TOs provide ratings, while TOPs\nprovide limits. A TOP may directly provide a facility limit to ISO.\n\nFor the purposes of this OP, “criteria” are applicable guidelines or rules used\nwhen establishing limits. Examples of criteria are the rules applied to establish\nstability limits (i.e., no loss of synchronism, acceptable damping and post-fault\nvoltage performance). Criteria are not ratings or limits.\n\nThis OP utilizes the following thermal capacity ratings for transmission facilities,\nas described in ISO Planning Procedure No. 7, Procedures for Determining and\nImplementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England (PP7):\n\n - Normal Rating (Normal)\n```\n   o Normal is a continuous 24-hour rating\n\n```\n - Long Time Emergency Rating (LTE)\n```\n   o LTE is a 12-hour summer rating and 4-hour winter rating\n\n```\n - Short Time Emergency Rating (STE)\n```\n   o STE is a 15-minute rating\n\n```\n - Drastic Action Limit (DAL)\n```\n   o DAL is a 5-minute rating\n\n```\nThe use of these ratings requires the pre-contingent facility loading to be at or\nbelow the Normal rating and that the facility loading be returned to or below the\nNormal rating after the daily load cycle. For the New England Transmission\nSystem, a load cycle is defined as:\n\n - A continuous 12-hour period during the summer\n\n - A continuous 4-hour period during the winter\n\nBoth summer (April 1 to October 31) and winter (November 1 to March 31) facility\nratings are established for each of these categories of ratings. These categories\nof ratings are as prescribed in PP7, which contains the facility ratings\nmethodology that is used by all TOs in the New England RCA/BAA.\n\nFor any facility that has two or more sets of thermal limits applicable (due to\nmultiple TOs, for example), the most conservative thermal limits shall be used.\n\nThis OP utilizes the following high and low voltage limits for transmission\nsubstations, as supplied to ISO and the LCCs by the TOs:\n\n  - Normal Voltage Limit (NORMVL)\n```\n     o NORMVL is a continuous 24-hour voltage limit\n\n```\n  - Long Time Emergency Voltage Limit (LTEVL)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n     o LTEVL is a voltage limit for a minimum of 30 minutes (duration\n\n```\nprovided by TO)\n\n  - Short Time Emergency Voltage Limit (STEVL)\n```\n     o STEVL is a 15-minute voltage limit\n\n```\n  - Drastic Action Voltage Limit (DAVL)\n```\n     o DAVL is a 5 (five) minute voltage limit\n\n```\nFigure 1 below shows an example set of voltage limits, with both the allowed\nvoltage level and acceptable time duration indicated in the figure. Operation at\nvoltage levels and time durations within the shaded area, including the\nboundaries, is within the limits and reliable, and therefore does not result in an\nSOL exceedance. Operation at voltages and time durations outside of the shaded\narea may result in an SOL exceedance. For any facility that has two or more sets\nof voltage limits applicable (due to multiple TOs, for example), the most\nconservative limits shall be used by ISO and the LCCs. Appendix K to this OP,\nOperating Voltage Limits by LCC (OP-19K) and Master / Local Control Center\nProcedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment H (M/LCC\n15H), Voltage SOL Identification Procedure, provides these limits\n\nFigure 1\n\nVoltage limit example\n\n1.10\n\n1.05\n\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n\n_voltage_\n\n0.85\n\n0.80\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 30 4 8 12 16 20 24\n\nminutes minutes minutes minutes minutes hours hours hours hours hours hours\n\n_time_\n\nThe set of voltage limits, NORMVL, LTEVL, STEVL, and DAVL, may include both\n“high” and “low” limits, but only the NORMVL set is required to include both “high”\nand “low” limits. Each set of NORMVL limits has a high and low limit, which\ntogether describe the voltage operating bandwidth using the NORMVL. The\nexample, shown in Figure 1 above, shows a “high” NORMVL of 1.05 per unit and\na “low” NORMVL of 0.95 per unit; it also shows an apparent LTEVL “low” limit of\n\n\n-----\n\n0.90 per unit with no corresponding LTEVL high limit.\n\nISO and each LCC shall take actions to establish and maintain NORMAL system\nconditions. ISO and the LCCs shall avoid regular cycling between NORMAL and\nEMERGENCY system conditions and shall not intentionally position daily\noperations into EMERGENCY system conditions for first contingency coverage.\n\n1. IROLs and SOLs\n\nISO establishes limits for the most critical system operating parameters of\nthe New England Transmission System which preclude, on a pre- and\npost-contingency basis, adverse impacts, as described above.\n\na. SOLs\n\nAn SOL is a value (such as MW, MVAr, Amperes, Frequency or Volts)\nthat satisfies the most limiting of the prescribed operating limits for a\nspecified system configuration to operate within acceptable reliability\ncriteria and ratings. ISO SOLs are based upon the following operating\nlimits:\n```\n   o Facility limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency equipment or\n\n```\nfacility limits)\n```\n   o Transient stability limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency stability\n\n```\nlimits)\n```\n   o System voltage limits (applicable pre- and post-contingency voltage\n\n```\nlimits, i.e. steady-state voltage limits)\n\nIn ISO determination of SOLs, the New England Transmission System\nconditions shall reflect:\n\n(1) current or expected system conditions; and\n\n(2) shall reflect changes to system topology such as facility outages,\nincluding outages of protection systems, and de-ratings.\n\nISO SOL methodology requires that SOLs provide New England\nTransmission System performance consistent with the following:\n```\n   o In the pre-contingency state:\n\n```\n     - The New England Transmission System shall demonstrate\n\nacceptable transient, dynamic, stability, and voltage performance;\n\n       - All facilities shall be within their facility limits (i.e., thermal, voltage,\n\nand stability limits).\n```\n   o Following the single contingencies identified in Table 1 of Appendix J\n\n```\nto this OP - Contingency List and Criteria/Limits (OP-19J):\n\n     - The New England Transmission System shall demonstrate\n\nacceptable transient, dynamic, stability, and voltage performance;\n\n\n-----\n\n          - All facilities shall be operating within their facility limits and within\n\ntheir thermal, voltage, and stability limits; and\n\n         - Cascading or uncontrolled separation shall not occur.\n```\n      o In determining the New England Transmission System response to a\n\n```\nsingle contingency, the following are acceptable:\n\n         - Planned or controlled interruption of electric supply to radial\n\ncustomers or some local network customers connected to, or\nsupplied by, the faulted facility or by the affected area.\n\n         - Interruption of other network customers, if the Real-Time operating\n\nconditions are more adverse than anticipated in the corresponding\nstudies.\n\n        - System reconfiguration through manual or automatic control or\n\nprotection actions.\n```\n      o To prepare for the next contingency, ISO may take or direct one or\n\n```\nmore of the following actions to adjust the New England Transmission\nSystem: re-dispatch of generation, demand, and external transactions,\nand reconfiguration of the transmission system topology.\n\nb. IROLs\n\nISO and each LCC operate the New England Transmission System so\nthat, in the pre- and post-contingent state, the system shall demonstrate\nthermal, voltage, and stability performance within accepted limits. Any\nSOL that has been identified by ISO to have an adverse impact beyond\nthe New England Transmission System is considered to be an IROL.\nThese IROLs require studies or post-event analysis for identification.\nExamples of unacceptable system performance that may result in an IROL\ninclude:\n```\n      o System instability.\n      o An oscillatory or negatively damped system response.\n      o An inability to determine if a discrete bounded sub-area of the system\n\n```\nis susceptible to voltage collapse or uncontrolled separation from the\nrest of the system.\n```\n      o Analysis results that indicate the isolation of a sub-area supplying more\n\n```\nthan 1,200 MW to the rest of the system, or absorbing more than 1,200\nMW of power from the rest of the system.\n```\n      o Uncontrolled islanding is considered an IROL. Controlled islanding as\n\n```\na result of proper operation of a Remedial Action Scheme (RAS)[5] to a\ncontingency for which it was designed is not considered an IROL (e.g.,\n\n5 Remedial Action Scheme is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\nislanding of Bangor, ME area and/or Maritimes transmission systems).\n```\n      o An identified sub-area of the system, that includes portions of the New\n\n```\nEngland Transmission System and/or another RCA/BAA, that is\nsusceptible to an exceedance of voltage limits or voltage collapse.\nThis determination shall be coordinated with the applicable Reliability\nCoordinator (RC)[6] to determine if the event remains classified as an\nIROL.\n```\n      o Facilities of another RCA that exceed their applicable facility limits for a\n\n```\ncontingency within the New England Transmission System. This\ndetermination shall be coordinated with the applicable RC to determine\nif the event remains classified as an IROL.\n\nChanges in network load, topology, and generation dispatch may alter the\nsystem response to an event and make what is normally an SOL into an\nIROL, or make what is normally an IROL into an SOL. ISO methodologies\nfor determining which SOLs are IROLs shall rely upon predictive analysis\ntechniques and may utilize Day-Ahead/Real-Time information to assess\nthe system.\n\n2. Transmission System Analysis\n\nAnalysis and modeling of the New England Transmission System is required\nfor reliable operation. ISO conducts next-day reliability analyses for the New\nEngland Transmission System for reliable operation in anticipation of\nNORMAL and EMERGENCY system conditions as well as contingency event\nconditions. ISO conducts contingency analysis studies to identify potential\ninterface and other SOL/IROL exceedances.\n\nUnder NORMAL system conditions, the New England Transmission System\nis operated to a level of reliability such that the loss of a major portion of the\nsystem, or unintentional separation of a major portion of the system, would\nnot result from any contingencies referred to in Table 1 of OP-19J. Under\nEMERGENCY system conditions, the New England Transmission System is\noperated to a level of reliability such that the loss of a major portion of the\nsystem, or unintentional separation of a major portion of the system, will not\nresult from any contingencies referred to in Table 2 of OP-19J.\n\n**B. Normal System**\n\n1. NORMAL System Conditions\n\nThe highest level of transmission reliability is achieved during NORMAL\n\nsystem conditions on the New England Transmission System. In general,\nthis level of reliability is accomplished by satisfying NORMAL ratings, criteria\nand limits for a wide range of contingencies (NORMAL System\nContingencies, as described in Section II.B.3 of this OP and defined in Table\n1 of OP-19J) using a limited set of operator actions (NORMAL System\nActions, as defined in Section II.B.4 of this OP). Information about simulating\n\n6 Reliability Coordinator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe contingencies is located in Table 3 of OP-19J.\n\n2. NORMAL System Ratings, Criteria and Limits\n\n[NORMAL transfer capabilities are to be observed unless EMERGENCY ]\n\nsystem conditions are declared.\n\n2.1. NORMAL System Thermal Limits\n\na. For pre-contingency system conditions, including planned outages,\n\ntransmission line and equipment loadings shall not exceed the Normal\nlimit.\n\nb. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause, or result in, loadings\n\nbeyond the STE limits. Flows between the LTE and STE limits must be\nreduced to or below the LTE limit as soon as possible but in a time not to\nexceed 15 minutes from the event. If studies show that operators would\nnot be able to reduce flows to or below the LTE limit within 15 minutes,\npre-contingent actions shall be taken such that following any NORMAL\nSystem Contingency flows can be reduced to or below the LTE limits\nwithin 15 minutes. Actions that may be taken pre or post-contingency to\nreduce flow are listed under NORMAL System Actions.\n\nPreviously established/provided DAL limits may be used only if authorized\nby the TOP whose transmission facilities would be affected and flows\nbetween the STE and DAL limits may be reduced to or below the LTE limit\nimmediately and in a time not to exceed 5 minutes from the event.\n\nAfter a contingency and all appropriate NORMAL System Actions are\ntaken, the following shall occur:\n\ni. Flows shall return to or below the Normal limit within the\nappropriate SOL or IROL timer, if the next contingency results in\nflow exceeding the LTE limit but below the STE limit; or\n\nii. Flows may remain between the Normal and LTE limits provided the\nnext contingency does not result in flow exceeding the LTE limit;\nand\n\niii. Loadings shall be returned to or below the Normal limit after the\ndaily load cycle\n\nIf the TOP does not know if the next contingency would result in an IROL\nor SOL, then the IROL timer shall be used.\n\nIf ISO Operations staff determines that neither of the above flow\nrequirements (i. or ii.) can be achieved after all appropriate NORMAL\nSystem Actions are taken, ISO shall consider implementation of\nEMERGENCY system conditions\n\n\n\n[c. System condition allowances for switching activities that are typically ]\n\ncompleted within 15 minutes are as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\ni. Pre-contingent system conditions during switching:\n\n      - During the time period when switches are open, a transmission\n\nfacility may not exceed the LTE limit\n\nii. Contingency protection during switching:\n\n       - During brief switching activities (typically 15 minutes or less, but\n\nnot to exceed 30 minutes), ISO shall only provide firstcontingency coverage as long as restoring the outage is not the\ncorrective action.\n\nd. Without prior approval to operate to the STE limits, NORMAL System\n\nContingencies shall not cause, or result in, loadings on New York ISO\n(NYISO) transmission facilities, including NYISO - ISO-NE RCA/BAA tie\nlines, beyond the LTE limits.\n\n2.2. NORMAL System Stability Criteria\n\na. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause instability of any single\n\nunit, the system, or unacceptable system oscillations. When determining\nacceptable system response, applicable criteria shall be applied,\nincluding, but not limited to, post-transient voltage sag and damping.\n\nb. Following a NORMAL System Contingency, unless specific instructions\n\ndescribing alternate actions are in effect, system flows shall be adjusted\nsuch that manual reclosing or automatic reclosing of a faulted element\nmay be carried out without affecting the stability of the New England\nTransmission System.\n\nc. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, NORMAL System\n\nContingencies shall not cause, or result in, any neighboring RCA/BAA to\nexceed its stability criteria\n\n2.3. NORMAL System Voltage Limits\n\na. NORMAL System Contingencies shall not cause unacceptably high or low\n\nvoltage in violation of limits or voltage collapse. The applicable voltage\nlimits are described in OP-19K and Master / Local Control Center\nProcedure No.15 - System Operating Limit Methodology, Attachment E\n(MLCC 15E) Transmission System Voltage Criteria Exceptions.\n\nb. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, NORMAL System\n\nContingencies shall not cause, or result in, any interconnected RCA/BAA\nto exceed its voltage limits\n\n2.4. NORMAL System Miscellaneous Criteria\n\na. Generation and transmission service is scheduled to provide the New\n\nEngland RCA/BAA load and operating reserve as prescribed in ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation\n(OP-8) while covering NORMAL System Contingencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nb. An LCC may request more stringent operating limits. If such a request is\n\nmade, ISO shall evaluate the request and honor it if there is no adverse\nsystem reliability consequence.\n\n3. NORMAL System Contingencies\n\nTable 1 of OP-19J identifies each type of contingency respected under\nNORMAL system conditions, if it is respected for SOLs or IROLs, and the\nappropriate thermal limits, voltage limits and stability criteria are applied. ISO\nshall respect these limits and criteria in Real-Time and in off-line system\nanalyses. OP-19K describes the voltage limits that each LCC applies to its\nsystem by voltage class.\n\nThe following M/LCC 15 Attachments address specific identified\ncontingencies, study methodologies and criteria, or their determination:\n\na. Attachment A 345 Stuck Breaker Contingencies That Can Have\n\nUnacceptable Inter-Area Impacts (Confidential)\n\nb. Attachment B 345 kV Double Circuit Tower Contingencies (Confidential)\n\nc. Attachment C Contingency Impact Evaluation\n\nd. Attachment D Bus Fault Contingencies (Confidential)\n\ne. Attachment E Transmission System Voltage Criteria Exceptions\n\nf. Attachment H Voltage SOL Identification Procedure\n\ng. Attachment I Primary and Secondary Voltage ICCP IDs\n\nh. Attachment K Voltage Task Force Work Scope\n\n4. NORMAL System Actions\n\nISO and each LCC shall continuously assess system conditions and\nimplement the NORMAL System Actions described below to maintain or\nrestore transmission reliability to NORMAL system conditions. Actions for\nSOL and IROL contingencies within the New England RCA/BAA shall use the\nfollowing NORMAL System Actions as required:\n\na. Adjusting Phase Shifting Transformers (PSTs)\n\nPSTs may be adjusted, pre or post-contingent, to achieve a desired postcontingent flow result.\n\nb. Adjusting Reactive Flows\n\nReactive flow may be adjusted through changes to shunt reactive devices\n(capacitors or reactors), adjustments to load tap changing transformers\nusing manual operator action, or changes to generator/reactive device\nvoltage schedule setpoints or bandwidths to achieve a desired postcontingent voltage result.\n\n\n-----\n\nc. Weather-Sensitive Transmission Facility Ratings\n\nThere are times when actual ambient conditions (temperature and wind\nspeed) are significantly different from those used to establish standard\nseasonal facility ratings. During those times, the use of temporary ratings\nbased on actual ambient conditions may be warranted. Depending on the\nambient conditions, the temporary ratings may be higher or lower than the\nstandard seasonal facility ratings. When such weather conditions exist\nand a transmission facility is limiting, ISO, the appropriate LCC or\nappropriate TO shall identify the need for a temporary transmission facility\nlimit based on actual weather conditions. In cases where the TO has\nsupplied pre-defined weather sensitive ratings, ISO and the appropriate\nLCC shall use such ratings after the LCC and/or TO has\ngathered/established the actual weather conditions. If pre-defined\nweather sensitive ratings are not available, the appropriate LCC shall\ninform the involved TO of the circumstances. The TO may elect to\nprovide the appropriate LCC with temporary ratings along with any\npertinent qualifications for their use. The appropriate LCC shall forward\nand document all temporary rating information to ISO. Such temporary\nratings shall then be used in operations as limits for the time period\nspecified by the TO or until rescinded by the TO.\n\nd. Deviation from Economic Dispatch\n\nIf the local area cannot be protected by economic dispatch, ISO and each\nLCC shall use a non-economic dispatch if it would provide improved\nsystem security. ISO shall deviate from economic dispatch and schedule\nresources to maintain NORMAL system transmission reliability.\n\ne. Use of an RAS\n\nWhere possible, with ISO approval, the LCC shall arm each RAS that\nwould relieve transmission limitations. When adequate facilities are not\navailable, an RAS may be employed to maintain system security. When\noperating as designed, it is acceptable for an RAS to interrupt flows on a\nsystem element if loading is in excess of an element DAL limit.\n\nf. Manually set up the tripping of a generator or a Dispatchable Asset\n\nRelated Demand (DARD)\n\nThis preplanned option of opening a circuit breaker is limited to a situation\nwhere previously documented studies have demonstrated that the breaker\nopening reliably mitigates the specific existing operating condition and\ndoes not result in the loss of single-contingency protection for another\ncontingency/facility.\n\ng. Switch Transmission Elements\n\nThis action (open or close an element to relieve transmission constraints)\nmay only be implemented when documented studies have demonstrated\nthat the element opening or closing reliably relieves the specific existing\ncondition and does not result in the loss of protection for another\n\n\n-----\n\ncontingency/facility and are agreed to by all applicable TOPs.\n\nh. OP-4 Actions\n\nImplement selected actions from OP-4 (Normal Actions of OP-4 include\nActions 1 through 5). These actions use generator maximum capabilities,\nvoluntary load curtailment of Market Participant's facilities,\ncapacity/energy purchases, contracted customer generation and depletion\nof 30-minute reserves.\n\ni. Use of Enhanced Facility Ratings or Limits\n\nWith the exception of all IROLs, if an SOL cannot be protected after\nutilizing the applicable NORMAL System Actions (a through h above), a\nTO or TOP may elect to modify the limiting thermal or voltage limit with an\nenhanced rating or limit to mitigate a Real-Time or post-contingent\nexceedance. When such a limit is provided for a post-contingent\nexceedance, the LCC shall provide a post-contingent action plan for\ncontingency protection. All coordination required with the impacted TO/s\nto provide contingency protection with enhanced ratings or limits and a\npost-contingent action plan for the SOL is the responsibility of the LCC.\nAll enhanced ratings or limits and post-contingent action plans used under\nthis provision shall be communicated to ISO electronically prior to\nimplementation. Use of a recorded line is acceptable for these purposes.\nWritten documentation of the enhanced ratings or limits and action plans\nshall be provided to ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed 24 hours. If\nthis option is not taken or is insufficient, pre-contingent load shedding\n(OP-7) shall be required.\n\n**C. Emergency System**\n\n1. EMERGENCY System Conditions\n\nThe system is in an EMERGENCY system condition if any of the NORMAL\nsystem ratings criteria or limits, as defined in Section II.C.2 of this OP, are\nexceeded. Recognizing the limited exposure to EMERGENCY system\nconditions, a revised set of contingencies is respected provided that ISO has\ninitiated all appropriate NORMAL System Actions to restore NORMAL system\nratings criteria or limits. This level of protection meets EMERGENCY System\nCriteria for a less stringent set of contingencies (EMERGENCY System\nContingencies, as described in Section II.C.3 of this OP and as defined in\nTable 2 of OP-19J) using EMERGENCY System Actions (as defined in\nSection II.C.4 of this OP). Exposure to EMERGENCY system conditions that\ndo not meet EMERGENCY system ratings, criteria or limits shall not exist for\nmore than 30 minutes for an IROL. The set of contingencies respected under\nEMERGENCY system conditions is described in Table 2 of OP-19J.\nInformation about simulating the contingencies is located in Table 4 of\nOP-19J.\n\n2. EMERGENCY System Ratings, Criteria and Limits\n\n2.1. EMERGENCY System Thermal Limits\n\n\n-----\n\n[a. After a contingency,and after TOPs take all appropriate EMERGENCY ]\n\nSystem Actions, the TOPs shall take actions so that:\n\ni. Flows shall return to the Normal limit or below within the\nappropriate SOL or IROL timer if the next contingency results in\nflow exceeding the LTE limit but below the STE limit or\n\nii. Flows may remain between the Normal and LTE limits provided the\nnext contingency does not result in flow exceeding the LTE limit\n\niii. Loadings shall be returned to the Normal limit or below after the\ndaily load cycle\n\n\n\n[b. If the TOP does not know if the next contingency would result in an IROL ]\n\nor SOL, then the TOP shall use the IROL timer.\n\n2.2. EMERGENCY System Stability Criteria\n\na. EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall not cause instability of any\n\nsingle generator or the system, or unacceptable system oscillations.\nWhen determining acceptable system response, the Operations engineer\nor TOP shall apply appropriate criteria, such as post-transient voltage sag\nand damping.\n\nb. Following an EMERGENCY System Contingency, unless specific\n\ninstructions describing alternate actions are in effect, the TOP shall adjust\nsystem flows such that manual reclosing or automatic reclosing of a\nfaulted element may be carried out without affecting the stability of the\nNew England Transmission System.\n\nc. Without prior approval to operate otherwise, EMERGENCY System\n\nContingencies shall not cause, or result in, a neighboring RCA/BAA\nexceeding its stability criteria.\n\n2.3. EMERGENCY System Voltage Limits\n\na. EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall not cause unacceptably high\n\nor low voltage in violation of Limits or voltage collapse. The applicable\nvoltage limits are described in OP-19K and M/LCC 15E.\n\nb. Without prior TOP approval to operate otherwise, EMERGENCY System\n\nContingencies should not cause, or result in, a neighboring RCA/BAA\nexceeding its voltage limits.\n\n2.4. EMERGENCY System Miscellaneous Criteria\n\na. In EMERGENCY system conditions, ISO shall maintain generation and\n\ntransmission facilities adequate to supply the New England RCA/BAA\ncustomer electricity demand and energy requirements and at least\nminimum reserve requirements (10-minute requirements) as prescribed in\nOP-8 while covering only EMERGENCY System Contingencies.\n\n[b. An LCC may request more stringent system operating limits. If such a ]\n\nrequest is made, ISO shall evaluate the request and honor it if there is no\n\n\n-----\n\nadverse system reliability consequence.\n\n3. EMERGENCY System Contingencies\n\nTable 2 of OP-19J identifies each type of contingency respected under\nEMERGENCY system conditions, if it is respected for SOLs or IROLs, and\nthe appropriate thermal limits, voltage limits and stability criteria are applied.\nISO respects these limits and criteria in Real-Time and in off-line system\nanalyses. OP-19K describes the pre and post-contingency voltage limits that\neach LCC applies to its system by voltage class. M/LCC15E documents the\nexceptions to the voltage limits noted in OP-19K.\n\n4. EMERGENCY System Actions\n\nTOPs shall take EMERGENCY System Actions to maintain or restore system\nconditions to at least those prescribed for operations under EMERGENCY\nsystem conditions. In general, all appropriate and timely NORMAL System\nActions shall be exhausted before taking EMERGENCY System Actions.\nTOPs shall take EMERGENCY System Actions before NORMAL System\nActions if the NORMAL System Actions cannot be completed in time to\nrelieve a thermal overload above the LTE limit, prevent voltage collapse, or\nrestore protection for EMERGENCY System Contingencies within 30 minutes\nfor an IROL. TOPs shall take any unused long-term NORMAL System\nActions to allow for the cancellation of EMERGENCY System Actions.\n\nEMERGENCY System Actions may be needed to meet EMERGENCY\n\nsystem ratings, criteria or limits even though a contingency has not occurred.\nTOPs shall take such pre-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions when\nNORMAL System Actions are exhausted or cannot be completed in a timely\nmanner and there would be insufficient time after an EMERGENCY System\nContingency to contain the impact as an SOL.\n\nTOPs shall also initiate pre-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions when\n\na potential EMERGENCY System Contingency threatens to cause an IROL\nviolation. TOPs shall also take pre-contingency EMERGENCY System\nActions when a potential EMERGENCY System Contingency poses the same\nthreats to any RCA/BAA outside of New England or jeopardizes the reliability\nof the Eastern Interconnection.\n\nOperations department management at ISO and at each appropriate LCC, to\n\nthe extent that time permits, shall consult with affected TOs when developing\npre-contingency strategies.\n\nThe following is a list of EMERGENCY System Actions:\n\na. Transmission Element Switching Actions\n\nWhere it is clear that opening a transmission facility would alleviate a\nproblem that exists for a specific emergency situation, TOs shall give\nconsideration to opening such facility. TOPs shall initiate this action,\nwithout pre-determined studies, documentation, and authority only to\nprevent more severe EMERGENCY System Actions and shall immediately\nreport such action to the TO.\n\n\n-----\n\nb. OP-4 and OP-7 Actions\n\ni. ISO shall implement selected actions from OP-4 (i.e., Emergency\nActions of OP-4 include Actions 6 through 11). These actions use\nvoltage reductions, additional use of generator maximum\ncapabilities, appeals for customer generation not contractually\navailable to Market Participants, voluntary load curtailment (large\nindustrial and commercial customers, radio and television appeals)\nand notices to state Governors to reinforce Power Warning appeals\n(as defined in OP- 4).\n\nii. OP-7 Action - Load shedding\n\nc. Planned Immediate Post-Contingency EMERGENCY System Actions\n\nIf an EMERGENCY System Contingency does not risk system stability but\nwould result in low or gradually declining voltages or thermal loadings\nbetween STE and DAL, ISO shall establish specific voltage reduction or\nload shedding plans before the contingency for implementation\nimmediately after the contingency. ISO shall establish and coordinate\npost-contingency EMERGENCY System Actions with each appropriate\nLCC before the need for implementation arises. If automatic devices are\nbeing used, each appropriate LCC shall confirm to the ISO the automatic\ndevice actions to be completed in a matter of cycles or seconds after the\ncontingency. ISO shall complete manual actions as soon as possible after\nthe contingency. ISO shall reduce post-contingent loadings between STE\nand DAL below LTE as soon as possible and in a time not to exceed 5\nminutes from the event.\n\nd. Use of Enhanced Facility Ratings or Limits\n\nWith the exception of all IROLs, if an SOL cannot be protected after using\nthe applicable EMERGENCY System Actions (a through c), a TO may\nelect to modify the limiting thermal or voltage limit with an enhanced rating\nor limit to mitigate a Real-Time or post-contingent exceedance. When\nsuch a limit is provided for a post-contingent exceedance, the LCC shall\nprovide a post-contingent action plan for contingency protection. All\ncoordination required with the impacted TO/s to provide contingency\nprotection for the SOL is the responsibility of the LCC. The LCC shall\nelectronically communicate all enhanced ratings or limits and postcontingent action plans used under this provision to ISO prior to\nimplementation. The use of a recorded line is acceptable for these\npurposes. The LCC shall provide written documentation of the enhanced\nratings or limits and action plans to ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed\n24 hours. If enhanced facility ratings or limits are not used or are\ninsufficient, ISO shall implement pre-contingent load shedding pursuant to\nOP-7.\n\n**D. Post-Contingency Operation**\n\nIf a contingency involves the loss of a transmission element(s), LCC operators\nshould attempt to reclose the element(s) within 5 minutes unless otherwise\n\n\n-----\n\nspecified in specific policies and/or procedures. If reclosure is unsuccessful, or\nthe contingency involved the loss of generation or load, ISO operators shall\nassess system conditions and perform appropriate NORMAL and EMERGENCY\nSystem Actions to restore NORMAL and EMERGENCY system conditions. When\npossible, ISO shall restore coverage for NORMAL System Contingencies using\nNORMAL System Actions.\n\nISO and LCC post-contingency actions shall meet the following time\nrequirements:\n\n  - Rapidly declining critical transmission voltages shall be stabilized as quickly\n\nas possible (within one or two minutes) and returned to operation within\nsystem voltage limits using pre-determined NORMAL and/or EMERGENCY\nSystem Actions.\n\n - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the STE and\n\nDAL limits shall be reduced below the LTE limit immediately and in a time\nnot to exceed 5 minutes from the event using pre-defined NORMAL and/or\nEMERGENCY System Actions.\n\n - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the LTE and\n\nSTE limits shall be reduced below the LTE limit as soon as possible and in a\ntime not to exceed 15 minutes from the event using appropriate NORMAL\nand/or EMERGENCY System Actions.\n\n - Post-contingent transmission facility thermal loadings between the Normal\n\nand LTE limits shall be reduced below the Normal limit as soon as possible\nand in a time not to exceed a load cycle using appropriate NORMAL and/or\nEMERGENCY System Actions.\n\n - Coverage for EMERGENCY System Contingencies shall be restored within\n\nthe appropriate time for an SOL/IROL using appropriate NORMAL System\nActions and/or EMERGENCY System Actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **OP-19 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to**\nthe RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

The list of TLCs in Table 1 is not a comprehensive list of TLCs. \n\n The current LPF standards can be found in an excel document on ISO’s external website by searching for “op17_lpf_standards.”\n\n For the purposes of LPF analysis, the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) has been divided into LPF areas as defined in OP17 Appendix A – Area Definitions (OP-17A). \n\n Table 1 of this OP-17C lists each TLC, their LPF area, and their TLC Contact. For the purposes of ISO LPF communications, the TLC Contact is the point of contact for each TLC. Where the TLC and TLC Contact are different entities, the TLC Contact shall act as the communication channel between ISO and the TLC. TLC Contacts are specified because ISO does not have Transmission Compliance Contacts for all of the TLCs. Conversely, ISO’s Customer and Asset Management System (CAMS) does have a Transmission Compliance Contact for all of the TLC Contacts listed below. The TLC Contact names used in Table 1 are the names in CAMS in the “Customer Long Name” field, and due to the field’s character restrictions, some TLC Contact names are truncated.\n\n As explained in OP-17, the two scenarios in which ISO will be communicating to the TLC via the TLC Contact include:\n\n Annual LPF Survey with No Operating Issues:\n\n As specified in OP-17, the ISO shall conduct a survey of all LPF areas annually or more frequently as circumstances may dictate. Communication of this information will proceed as follows:\n\n 1. ISO VTF Chair sends the LPF area survey results to the TLC Contacts.\n\n 2. TLC Contacts forward the LPF area survey results to each of their associated TLCs within the surveyed area(s). \n\n Operating Issue Related to LPF Non-Compliance: \n\n As specified in OP-17, if an operating issue relating to LPF non-compliance is identified, communication will proceed as follows:\n\n 1. ISO will request the applicable LCC(s) to confirm the TLCs in the non- compliant area(s). \n\n 2. ISO will send a data request to the TLC Contact for each TLC in the non- compliant area. \n\n 3. TLC Contacts forward the data request(s) to the indicated TLCs. In the most optimistic scenario, the TLC Contact will then have no further involvement because the TLC will reach out to ISO directly, as described in step 4 below. \n\n\n-----\n\n#### However, in the event that there is no response from the TLC, ISO will re- send the data request to the TLC Contact and again, the TLC Contact forwards the data request to the indicated TLCs. \n\n 4. Upon receipt of the data request, the TLC is expected to respond directly to the ISO. The intention of the data request is to procure additional LPF data from the TLC to determine the TLCs involvement in the area’s non-compliant LPF performance. The data request will include ISO’s contact so that the TLC can communicate with the ISO directly.  \n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|LPF Survey Areas and Transmission Load

Introduction\n\nThis Appendix A to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 - Metering and\nTelemetering Criteria (“OP-18A”) defines the communications network processor (CNP)\nrequirements that Local Control Centers (LCCs) and Supervisory Control and Data\nAcquisition (SCADA) Control Centers (referred to herein as “sites”) shall comply with for\nany Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) server operating on the ISO\nNew England (ISO) ICCP network.\n\nThe following main topics are discussed within this document:\n\n     - Configuring and testing a new ICCP server\n\n     - The format of the data exchange bilateral table\n\n     - Data quality and status bit conventions\n\n     - Coordinated database maintenance\n\n#### II. ICCP Server Requirements\n\nThe ICCP software shall be certified by its vendor as compliant to the IEC 60870-6 TASE.2\nstandard (1996-8 or above).\n\nServer redundancy is required with a minimum of 2 production servers; 1 production server\nat the Enabled Control Center (ECC) and 1 production server at the Standby Control\nCenter (SCC) as applicable. Additionally, there shall be at least 1 development/test server\nfor use in verifying software and database changes prior to production implementation.\n\n#### III. ICCP Network Configuration\n\nThe ICCP network for LCCs and SCADA TOs shall utilize diverse routing and redundancy\nto ensure there is no single point of failure, consisting of three (3) distinct communications\npaths. Each path shall include one router per network for each LCC and SCADA TO. Two\npaths shall be telecom circuits and a third path with STN. All ICCP network failovers shall\noccur automatically.\n\nLCCs and SCADA TOs shall physically separate ISO-NE provided ICCP routers (i.e.\nunderlying electrical/environmental infrastructure, adjacent network infrastructure, etc.) to\neliminate single points of failure.\n\nLCCs and SCADA TOs shall provide maximum physical diversity for all incoming telecom\n& STN ICCP circuits to eliminate single points of failure.\n\nDiagram 1 illustrates the ICCP network configuration for Control Centers.\n\nAny exceptions and conditions upon variations from the network as described and shown\nin Figure 1 shall be made by request for ISO approval.\n\n\n-----\n\nUtility Owned (STN)\n\nCommercial Carrier (By ISO)\n# }\n\n\nISO-NE Enabled\n\nControl Center\n\n**ICCP Network**\n\nRedundant and diversely\n\nrouted to prevent single\n\npoint of failure\n\n\n\n          - The LCC and SCADA TO facilities shown here include an ICCP server\nfor communications with the ICCP network. **ICCP**\n\nConnection to the LCC or SCADA\n\nTO Enabled Control Center and\nStandby Control Center via two\n\ncommercial carrier channels and\n\nthe STN\n\n#### Diagram 1 – New England ICCP Network\n\n IV. ICCP Site / Server Configuration\n\n\nISO-NE Standby\n\nControl Center\n\nLCC or SCADA TO\n\nStandby Control Center\n\nLCC Control Centers shall be\n\ncomplete functional\n\nequivalents\n\nLCC or SCADA TO\n\nEnabled Control Center\n\n\n**ICCP**\n\n\nServer connection parameters for all new or modified servers shall be published in the\nICCP “Association Information Exchange Form” (AIEF) through an electronically secure\nmethod. A blank template of this form is provided as Attachment 1 to this OP-18A.\n\nAll ICCP sites shall connect to, and retrieve data from, the site in which the data source\noriginates. Data shall not be passed through from site A to site C through any other site.\nSite C should get the data directly from site A. (i.e., data shall not be relayed through any\nsite.) See Diagram 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiagram 2\n\nAll dataset requests shall be configured in the most efficient manner with the following\ncriteria:\n\nA. Similar data shall be grouped in the same dataset(s) such as analog versus status.\n\nB. Datasets shall not exceed 600 data items unless agreed upon by all the ICCP sites.\n\nC. Appropriate dataset properties shall be configured for each dataset to optimize\n\nefficiency.\n\n1. Statuses shall be reported by ‘exception’ (RBE) processing.\n\n2. Analogs shall be reported in ‘periodic’ mode.\n\n3. Data update rates shall not exceed those specified in OP-18.\n\n#### V. Testing\n\nThe following testing shall be completed before a new server is placed into service as a\nproduction system.\n\nA. Network connectivity - verify firewall and routing\n\n1. For new circuit installations, once the ICCP circuits are in place, ISO shall verify\n\ncommunications to the router.\n\n2. The remote site shall verify that it can ping the ICCP router at its local site from\n\neach of its servers.\n\n3. The remote site shall verify that it can ping all other remote site routers.\n\nB. Association testing - verify AIEF connection parameters\n\n1. For each new server, a connection shall be established to the\n\ndevelopment/test server at each entity to which it connects. After all\ndevelopment/test server testing is complete, a similar connection-testing\nscheme shall be developed for each production server based on remote\n\n\n-----\n\nserver capabilities.\n\n2. Use of ICCP analyzer software may be necessary to debug issues at this\n\nlevel.\n\nC. Dataset testing\n\n1. Verify partial dataset creation functionality.\n\n2. Verify that periodic datasets update at the defined rate.\n\n3. Verify that RBE datasets update only when data changes and at the defined\n\nintegrity poll time.\n\nD. Data value testing\n\n1. If the site has a live data feed to its new server, then point-to-point testing shall\n\noccur for analog and status points.\n\n2. The site shall confirm with all applicable associations that the same value and\n\npolarity (for analogs) is received.\n\nE. Data quality testing\n\n1. If the site has a live data feed to its new server, then quality code testing shall\n\noccur for analog and status points.\n\n2. The site shall confirm with all applicable associations that the appropriate quality\n\ncodes are sent and received.\n\n#### VI. Data Quality Flags\n\nTypically, telemetered data is of good quality. However, there are a few common scenarios\nin which manual intervention of quality codes shall be performed by the entity that owns the\ndata. The scenarios and recommended actions are as follows:\n\nA. Scenario A - The analog values have a “BAD” quality code due to a communication\n\nline, remote terminal unit (RTU), or other supporting equipment failure and the data\nvalue is not updating. In this case, the value shall be manually updated as\nfrequently as appropriate or state estimator (SE) replacement data shall be\nprovided in its place. If the data is not critical, then it is acceptable to leave it as\n“BAD” quality unless requested by another site. The determination of whether or\n**not data is critical is made jointly by ISO and the LCCs or the SCADA Control**\nCenters (SCCs).\n\nB. Scenario B - The analog values have a “GOOD” quality code but the actual values\n\nare wrong. This may be due to equipment that has “stalled” or is possibly being\nworked on and is sending incorrect values. In this case, the data quality should be\nmodified to be either “BAD” quality, manually replaced, or SE replaced. If the value\nis manually replaced, then it should be updated as frequently as appropriate.\n\nFor either scenario, OP-2 specifies the priority and timeframe in which repair efforts shall\nbe made. Repairs that do not comply with OP-2 requirements are subject to ISO review\nand compliance investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### VII. Data Definitions\n\nEach site shall develop a data table for the following categories of power system data to aid\nin the identification of the data to other interested parties. The definition in the data table\nshall match the device name that exists in the field and in the one-line drawings.\n\nA. Transmission station names\n\nB. Transmission lines\n\nC. Transformers\n\nD. Generating stations/Resources\n\nE. Breakers/switches\n\nF. Other\n\n#### VIII. Data Definition Updates\n\nEach site shall be required to prepare an initial data table of ICCP data point identifiers in\nMicrosoft Excel format prior to connecting to the ICCP network. This data table is also\nknown as the bilateral table file. Subsequent updates shall be required as data definitions\nare changed via additions, deletions, or modifications. ICCP IDs for new equipment shall\nbe published at least one (1) week prior to equipment energization. Each site shall assume\nthe responsibility for distributing its definition updates.\n\nThe ISO ShareFile web portal hosts the data file storage and distribution for these files. To\nrequest access to the ShareFile site, each individual must contact the “Security\nAdministrator” representative from their entity and have them request “Citrix ShareFile LCC\nIntercontrol Center Protocol” access for the individual through the ISO Customer and Asset\nManagement System (CAMS). Any update to these data files shall consist of the following\nactions:\n\nA. An email notice with a summary listing of changes shall be sent to the data\n\ncommunication task force (DCTF) email distribution list.\n\nB. The updated data file shall be uploaded to the ShareFile web portal.\n\n#### C. The data file shall consist of one (1) tab that follows the descriptions further\n\ndescribed in section VIII of this document.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### IX.

Coordinated Database Maintenance\n\nA. **Annual deletion process**\n\nBeginning in January and continuing through May of each year, each ICCP site shall identify\nhost data items to be deleted in November/December by marking them in the bilateral table\nusing the format specified in this OP-18A. This includes updating the change code field from\n“RIP” to “DEL” and the change date field to 11/01/YYYY (where YYYY represents the current\nyear).\n\nBy June 30[th], a list of the data items to be deleted, including their ICCP IDs and point\ndescriptions, shall be sent to the DCTF email distribution list. An updated bilateral table\nshowing these changes shall also be posted to the ISO ShareFile web portal by this date.\n**No new points shall be allowed for deletion in the current year’s cycle after this date. Any**\nadditional items shall become orphans - meaning that their IDs shall remain on the host\nICCP server, but no longer have live data behind them. Such points shall be indicated in the\nbilateral table with “RIP” in the change code field along with the date (in the change date\nfield) when the points stopped receiving live updates. These “RIP” points shall then become\nthe starting “DEL” points for the next year.\n\nThe months of July and August shall be used for review and coordination. All client sites\nshall review the proposed data value deletions. Each client site shall review the information\nand coordinate any issues with host sites proposing the deletions. Any required changes\nshall be made by the host site in its bilateral table, published to the ISO ShareFile web portal,\nand an update notification shall be sent to the DCTF email distribution list.\n\nThe months of September and October shall be used for client sites to stop requesting all\ndata items marked for deletion. In November, the host site shall resend the June 30[ th] list of\npoints to be deleted, to the DCTF email distribution list, along with a date within the current\nyear in which they will be removed. Following the removal from their ICCP server, the host\nsite shall notify the DCTF email distribution list that the work is complete.\n\nB. **Deletion yearly overview**\n\n1. January through May: each site shall identify host data items for deletion in\n\nNovember/December and change its state to “RIP”.\n\n2. By June 30[ th]: each site shall publish an updated bilateral table and email summary of\n\n“DEL” points to be deleted, to the DCTF email distribution list. All “RIP” points may be\nchanged to “DEL” at this time.\n\n3. July through August: each client site reviews other host sites’ bilateral tables and\n\ncoordinates any issues concerning data item deletions.\n\n4. September through October: each site modifies its data set requests (client’s requests)\n\nby removing the data items marked for current year deletion.\n\n5. November through December: host site resends June 30[ th] list of points to be deleted,\n\nspecifying a date when this will occur. After deletion, e-mail confirmation is sent to the\nDCTF email distribution list.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nAny and all necessary outages associated with the above work are required to be scheduled\nthrough the normal OP-2 outage process.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### XI.

As of 2021, the 2020 LPF standards were composed of five\n(5) points:\n\nMaximum standard is composed of three (3) points:\n\n    - 7,000 MW light load\n\n    - 9,000 MW light load\n\n    - 18,000 MW intermediate load biased for high voltage\n\nMinimum standard is composed of two (2) points:\n\n    - 18,000 MW intermediate load biased for low voltage\n\n   - 28,000 MW heavy load\n\nOne curve connects the minimum LPF standard points and a second curve connects\nthe maximum LPF standard points. The two (2) curves represent the upper and lower\nboundaries of LPFs that establish the standard for the area. The following figure shows\nan example of minimum and maximum LPFs for an area, as a function of load level.\n\n**Figure 1.1: Example of LPF Standards for a Given Study Area**\n\nMaximum PF\nMinimum PF\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.7\n\n7000 9000 11000 13000 15000 17000 19000 21000 23000 25000 27000\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.TESTING CRITERIA**\n\nA general criterion is used to determine the minimum and maximum LPFs at each load\nlevel, for all areas.\n\n1. **Minimum/Maximum Voltage**\n\na. When the study area LPF is at its maximum, a significant number of\n\ntransmission busses (69 kV and above) within the study area cannot\nexceed the high voltage design criteria of the Transmission Owners\n(TOs) in the area.\n\nb. When the study area LPF is at its minimum, a significant number of\n\ntransmission busses (69 kV and above) within the study area cannot\ndrop below the low voltage design criteria of the TOs in the study\narea.\n\nc. A “significant number of transmission busses” is to be determined by\n\nthe VTF, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPost-contingency analysis must be performed for the Minimum/Maximum\nVoltage test during all lines-in system conditions.\n\nAdditionally, for the maximum LPF standard at light load levels, post\nContingency Analysis (CA) must be performed for the most limiting facility out\nsystem condition.\n\nFor all load levels, the VTF will determine, based upon a review of results, the\nappropriate LPF standard to apply.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n2. **Limiting Criterion for Minimum and Maximum LPF: -**\n\nThe LPF standards should not create an overreliance on distribution-installed\nreactive devices to maintain acceptable transmission system voltage\nperformance.\n\nTo prevent LPF over-correction:\n\n      - The maximum LPF standard must not fall below unity (i.e., lagging LPF\n\nlimit is not allowed)*; and\n\n      - The minimum LPF standard must not fall above unity (i.e., leading LPF\n\nlimit is not allowed)\n\nThe maximum LPF standard is determined by system performance at light to\nintermediate load levels based upon post-contingency high voltage performance.\nIf the maximum voltage criterion indicates that a lagging (below unity) maximum\nLPF standard is needed, this result will be deemed unacceptable. Other\ntransmission solutions (e.g., transmission reactors) should be investigated.\n\nThe minimum LPF standard is determined by system performance at\nintermediate to peak load levels based upon post-contingency low voltage\nperformance. If the minimum voltage criterion indicates that a leading (above\nunity) minimum LPF standard is needed, this result will be deemed\nunacceptable. Other transmission solutions (e.g., transmission capacitors)\nshould be investigated.\n\nSee Figures 2.1 and 2.2 below for examples of acceptable and unacceptable LPF\nstandards.\n\nFigure 2.1 notes an example of acceptable LPF standards, in part, because neither\ncurve crosses unity LPF.\n\nFigure 2.2 documents an example of unacceptable LPF curves for both the minimum\nand maximum LPF standards. Both curves cross the unity LPF line. These results\nindicate a reliance on distribution-installed reactive devices to maintain acceptable\ntransmission system voltage performance (i.e., capacitors to support low voltage\nconcerns and reactors to support high voltage concerns).\n\n*Boston LPF area is the one area that is exempted from the maximum standard limiting\ncriterion. This is due to the abundance of cables in Boston, which necessitated planning\nfor a lagging LPF.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.1\n\nExample of acceptable LPF standards\n\nFigure 2.2\n\nExample of unacceptable LPF standards\n\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.LPF DEVELOPMENT**\n\n**1. New England Load Levels to be Modeled**\n\na. Heavy Net Load (28,000 MW)\n\nb. Intermediate Net Load (18,000 MW)\n\nc. Light Net Load (7,000 MW)\n\n**NOTE**\n\nNew England load will be calculated as follows:\n\nNew England area Load +\n\nNew England area Losses –\n\nNew England area Station Service Load.\n\nPump Storage units will not be included in the calculation of New England load level\nfor the purposes of these load power factor studies.\n\n**2. LPF Area Definition**\n\nEach LPF area shall be modeled according to the definition in, Operating\nProcedure No. 17 – Load Power Factor and System Assessment Appendix A –\nArea Definitions (OP-17A). Should new transmission projects introduce a\nchange along the existing LPF area boundaries, OP-17A shall be promptly\nupdated to reflect the area definitions used in the current study.\n\n**3. Load Data**\n\na. MW loads at each bus are to be initialized using ISO projections for the\n\nappropriate net load level. MW load values contained in New England\nLibrary LPF cases are typically suitable. These will reflect appropriately\napplied PV and energy efficiency impacts for the studied conditions.\n\nb. MW loads at each bus are to be scaled to the appropriate net load level (i.e.\n\n28,000 MW, 18,000 MW or 7,000 MW).\n\nc. Loads are independent of voltage [constant Power/Reactive (PQ)\n\nrepresentation].\n\n**4. Generator Data and Dispatch**\n\na. For each load level, Generators are to be dispatched economically in the\n\nbase cases, assuming all New England Generators are available and\nrespecting reserve requirements.\n\n**5. Capacitors/Reactors**\n\nAll sub-transmission/distribution capacitors and reactors (below 69 kV) are to be\nconsidered as part of the study area load.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**6. Tie-Lines**\n\na. Inter-Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA)\n\nInterface transfers should be tested up to transfer limits where appropriate.\n\nb. HVDC Tie-Lines should be treated like Generators/Demand, and dispatched\n\naccordingly.\n\n**7. Solution Parameters for Contingency Testing**\n\na. Automatic load tap changing is allowed on all tests.\n\nb. Phase Angle Regulators (PARs) are allowed to regulate flow.\n\nc. The system swing bus is located outside of New England with no regulation\n\nof RCA/BAA interchange flows.\n\n**8. LPF Measurement**\n\nThe LPF must be measured at the transmission level (i.e., at the high side of the\ntransmission step down transformers), typically the 115 kV or 69 kV bus.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV.CONTINGENCIES TO BE TESTED**\n\nThe VTF will determine the list of contingencies to be tested for each area’s LPF\nstandard study. All normal contingencies, as defined in ISO New England Operating\nProcedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19), may be selected for the LPF\nstudy. The OP-19 contingencies consist of individual transmission facilities (i.e.,\ntransmission lines, transformers, generators), as well as contingencies that result in the\nloss of multiple transmission facilities (i.e., Breaker Failure and Double Circuit Tower\nContingencies) that have unacceptable inter-RCA/BAA impact.\n\nIf a contingency would knowingly trigger a Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or\nAutomatic Control Scheme (ACS), then the RAS and ACS actions are to be modeled in\na contingency definition.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**V.TESTING PROCEDURE**\n\nLPFs for these tests are developed from the guidelines described in Section III of this\ndocument (“LPF Development”). Testing focuses on only one study area, at one load\nlevel, at a time. To develop a minimum LPF standard for a given load level, the\nloadflow case is biased toward low voltage conditions. To develop a maximum LPF\nstandard for a given load level, the loadflow case is biased toward high voltage\nconditions.\n\nAs the LPF is varied in an attempt to find the LPF standard, a uniform LPF must be\napplied (i.e., the same LPF must be applied to each bus in the study area).\n\n**A. MINIMUM LPF - The minimum LPF** for each load level is determined as follows.\n\n**1. Low Voltage Bias - Starting from an economic dispatch, generation should be**\n\nbiased toward low voltage conditions:\n\na. **Import Study Areas - In study areas where less economical generation**\n\nexists in comparison with the load (i.e. “Import Study Areas”), the base cases\nshould be biased for low voltage as follows:\n\n1) Shut off the Generator with largest net VAr producing capability (unless\n\nsuch Generator is required to run for reliability reasons), within subject\narea.\n\n2) Adjust New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to depress\n\ntransmission voltages within study area. Interface transfers that tend to\ndepress study area voltages are to be dispatched up to or near existing\nlimits, depending on the practicality of dispatch and operations at each\nload level.  This could involve dispatching up to existing import limits for\nImport Interfaces (e.g., Boston Import), and/or dispatching up to existing\nlimits for through-flow Interfaces (e.g., North-South). The preference\nwhen changing interface transfers is to fully shut off generators as\nopposed to partially lowering output. This minimizes the availability of\navailable MVAR sources.\n\nb. **Export Study Areas - In study areas where more economical generation**\n\nexists in comparison with the load (i.e., “Export Study Areas”), the base cases\nshould be biased for low voltage as follows:\n\n1) Adjust New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to depress\n\ntransmission voltages within study area. This usually involves\ndispatching to existing export limits for the study area.\n\nInterface transfers that tend to depress study area voltages are to be\ndispatched up to or near existing limits, depending on the practicality of\ndispatch and operations at each load level.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Reactive Dispatch - For each load level, VAr support from all area generation**\n\nand transmission VAr sources is to be maximized:\n\na. Turn on all Transmission VAr sources (e.g., Capacitor banks, STATCOMs,\n\netc.) in the area (subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all\nbusses, as well as other constraints, e.g., Phase II filter requirements,\ndynamic reserve requirement for STATCOMs, etc.).\n\nb. Shut off all Transmission VAr absorption facilities (e.g., Reactors, etc.) in the\n\nstudy area (subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all busses, as\nwell as other constraints, e.g., Phase II filter requirements, dynamic reserve\nrequirement for STATCOMs, etc.).\n\nc. Set voltage schedules of all study area Generators to the normal schedule.\n\nThe general approach, when determining the minimum LPF standard, is to use\nas much generation and transmission VAr support in the area as possible.\n\n**3. Voltage Criteria Testing - For each load level, the minimum LPF standard**\n\nbased on voltage criteria is to be determined as follows:\n\na. Determine the contingency that results in the lowest transmission voltages in\n\nthe study area\n\nb. Adjust the study area LPF until a significant number of transmission busses\n\n(69 kV and above) do not drop below the design criteria of TOs in the study\narea. This LPF constitutes the minimum LPF for the study area based on\nvoltage criteria.\n\n**B. MAXIMUM LPF - The maximum LPF** for each load level is determined as follows.\n\n**1. High Voltage Bias - Starting from an economic dispatch, generation should be**\n\nbiased toward high voltage conditions as follows (for either export or import study\nareas):\n\na. Shut off the Generator with largest net VAr absorbing capability (unless such\n\nGenerator is required to run for reliability reasons), within the study area.\n\nb. Adjust the New England Transmission Interface transfers so as to inflate\n\ntransmission voltages within subject area. This entails a dispatch that\nminimizes I[2]X losses in the subject area.\n\n**2. Reactive Dispatch - For each load level, VAr absorption capability from all area**\n\ngeneration and transmission VAr facilities is to be maximized:\n\na. Shut off all transmission VAr sources (e.g., capacitors, etc.) in area (subject\n\nto minimum/maximum voltage schedule at all busses, as well as other\nconstraints (e.g., Phase II filter requirements, dynamic reserve requirement\nfor STATCOMs, etc.).\n\nb. Turn on all transmission VAr absorption facilities (e.g., reactors, STATCOMs,\n\netc.) in the area [subject to minimum/maximum voltage schedules at all\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nbusses, as well as other constraints (e.g., Phase II filter requirements,\ndynamic reserve requirements for STATCOMs, etc.)].\n\nc. Set the voltage schedules of all study area Generators to the normal\n\nschedule.\n\nThe general approach, when determining the maximum LPF standard, is to use as\nmuch generation and transmission VAr absorption capability in the study area as\npossible.\n\n**3. Voltage Criteria Testing - For each load level, the maximum LPF based on**\n\nvoltage criteria is to be determined as follows:\n\na. Determine contingency that results in the highest transmission voltages in the\n\nstudy area.\n\nb. Adjust the study area LPF until a significant number of transmission busses\n\n(69 kV and above) do not exceed the design criteria of TOs in the study area.\nThis LPF constitutes the maximum LPF for the study area based on voltage\ncriteria.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**VI.STUDY SUMMARY**\n\nA study summary shall be written to document all analysis conducted to determine the\nLPF standard. The study summary is specific to a LPF study area, load level, and a\nmaximum or minimum standard. For example, there would be one study summary for\nSEMA 7GW maximum point, and another study summary for SEMA 18GW minimum\npoint. The study summary shall include the following:\n\n    - The new LPF standard\n\n     - List of contingencies evaluated.

It also describes the analysis that ISO undertakes to monitor,\nassess and report on LPF compliance\n\nA. Overview\n\nISO is responsible for operating all transmission facilities rated 115 kV and above.\nLocal Control Centers (LCCs) are responsible for operating all transmission facilities\nrated 69 kV and below. To maintain a reliable system, ISO and the LCCs manage the\npre-contingent voltage profile of the New England Transmission System[1] and the\nsystem’s reactive power Resources to meet reactive power demands. Managing the\nreactive power output of energy Resources as well any dynamic and shunt reactive\npower elements connected to the transmission system helps supply the system’s\nreactive losses and the reactive demand of load served by the system.\n\nOne key contributing factor to system voltage is the reactive demand of system load.\nThe reactive demand component of load is often described in terms of LPF. The LPF\nis, in simple terms, the ratio of real power demand (MW) to apparent power (MVA).\nLPF is a key study assumption used in long range planning of the transmission system,\nand it is a key factor in the operation of the power system. Significant changes in LPF\nfrom that assumed in planning studies can lead to out-of-merit Resource commitments\nto prevent unacceptable high or low system voltages, and potential reliability concerns,\nwhen operating the system.\n\nB. Responsibilities\n\nISO monitors the LPF throughout the New England Transmission System by surveying\nportions of the system defined as LPF Areas in Appendix A – Area Definitions. Those\nAreas where LPF is not within defined acceptable LPF ranges (which are defined by\nthe LPF used in planning or that defined by operating analyses), and/or where an\nOperating Issue exists, shall implement the actions listed in Part I(C)(1-2).\n\nFor purposes of this OP, the term “Operating Issue” is defined as an actual or near\nvoltage limit exceedance condition that requires any of the following mitigating actions:\n\n     - Deviating from economic dispatch,\n\n     - Switching out a cable,\n\n     - Purchase of available emergency capacity or energy,\n\n     - Shedding load\n\n1 The New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and includes the Reliability\nCoordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA), Bulk Electric System (BES) and\nNPCC bulk power system (BPS) elements found within New England on the transmission\nnetwork.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Actions that go beyond what is established by current Transmission Operating\n\nGuides (TOGs)\n\nFor example, additional commitment of generators to control a post-contingent high\nvoltage limit exceedance due to a change in LPF is deemed an Operating Issue due to\nthe exceedance’s impact on the system’s ability to accommodate the limiting system\ncondition / topology as well as the availability of generation to mitigate the voltage limit\nexceedance.\n\nC. Compliance Actions\n\n1. Non-compliance with LPF Standard\n\nFor each LPF area that violates its standard(s), a letter will be sent to all TLC\nContacts (s) within the LPF area by the end of the year following the survey year.\nFor example, in 2022, the year 2021 is being surveyed, and by the end of 2022, a\nletter regarding the 2021 survey results will be sent.\n\nIn the letter, TLC(s) within the violating LPF area are encouraged to evaluate their\nLPF performance, and if they in fact violated the LPF standard, to take mitigating\nactions to improve LPF performance. However, the TLC is not responsible for\nproviding the analysis or mitigating plan to ISO. Since the LPF survey aggregates\nthe performance of all load serving transformers within an LPF area, it is possible\nthat an individual TLC operated within the LPF standards, yet exists within an LPF\narea that, as a whole, violated the standard(s).\n\nIn the letter, several hours of poor performance will be identified. The poor\nperformance hours do not represent the extent of the problem within the violating\nLPF area; rather, the poor performance hours provide a potential starting point or\nfocus point for the TLCs’ investigation. It is possible that the TLC was in fact\ncompliant during the identified poor performance hour and yet not compliant during\nanother hour that was not identified. Ultimately, the responsibility of assessing an\nindividual TLC’s LPF performance lies with that TLC. The poor performance hours\nidentified by ISO on the LPF letters will represent 10 unique days of the highest\nMVAR surplus or deficiency. The hour of the highest MVAR surplus or deficiency\nof that day will also be identified. Therefore, the hours identified may not be the top\n10 hours for highest surplus or deficiency. For example, if one day contains the\nthree highest surplus hours for the year, only the highest surplus hour of that day\nwill be listed on the letter.\n\n2. Operating Issue\n\nThe ISO shall conduct the initial review of any Operating Issue and depending on the\nresults of that technical review shall:\n\n  - Share any correlation of new system voltage Operating Issues and LPF with the\n\nVoltage Task Force (VTF);\n\n  - Review trends with the VTF and any appropriate entities and recommend\n\ncorrective actions;\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n     - Review trends with Master / Local Control Center Heads and Reliability\n\nCommittee when appropriate\n\nThe timeline and actions applicable when an Operating Issue is identified are as\nfollows:\n\n     - ISO shall send a request to the LCC to confirm the Transmission Load\n\nCustomers (TLC) and Transmission Load Customer Contacts (TLC Contacts)\nas recorded in Appendix C – Instructions for the ISO New England Load Power\nFactor Survey (OP-17C) in a non-compliant area, within seven (7) Business\nDays of the event identification.\n\n     - The LCC shall confirm / correct the list of TLCs and TLC Contacts in the non\ncompliant area within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of the list.\n\n     - ISO shall request additional data from the TLC Contact(s) to determine the\n\nentities involved in the actual or near miss Operating Issue within seven (7)\nBusiness Days of receipt of LCC confirmation. As described in OP-17C, the\nTLC Contact is expected to forward the data requests to their associated TLCs\nas indicated in OP-17C Table 1.\n\n     - The TLC shall send requested data regarding LPF operation to ISO System\n\nOperations for the identified dates and times by no later than fourteen (14)\nBusiness Days of the data request. If the TLC believes the requested data is\nvoluminous and requires additional time to collect, it can request additional time\nfrom the ISO.\n\n     - ISO shall review the TLC’s LPF data. If review and analysis of the TLC LPF\n\ndata demonstrates that the TLC contributed to the Operating Issue, then ISO\nwill send a notification of non-compliance to the responsible TLC.  The\nnotification of non-compliance will be send to the TLC within fourteen (14)\nBusiness Days of the TLC’s data submittal to ISO Operations.\n\n     - Responsible TLCs shall submit to the ISO an action plan within forty (40)\n\nBusiness Days of receipt of a non-compliance notification. The mitigation plan\nshall include an expected date of a return-to-compliance based upon completion\nof the action plan.\n\n     - Responsible TLCs shall submit evidence of implementing the action plan to\n\nreturn-to-compliance, to ISO within forty (40) Business Days of submitting the\naction plan, as well as when the action plan is complete.\n\n**II.** **LPF REQUIREMENT**\n\nThe ranges of acceptable LPFs within the New England Control Area (described in\nAppendix A – Area Definitions) are portrayed as bandwidths of LPF expressed as a\nfunction of system load level. For a specific system load level (see Figure 1), the\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nbandwidth between a pair of limiting curves represents the range of acceptable LPFs.\n\n  - These ranges are determined by ISO, in coordination with the TOs, for planning\n\nand system design studies.\n\n\n\n  - These ranges are determined by ISO, in consultation with the VTF, for Real\nTime operations, when LPF curve updates are warranted based on major\nsystem changes such as installation of major transmission projects, generation\nadditions or retirements, or installation of new significant reactive power\nResources.\n\nAppendix B – Methodology for Developing Load Power Factor Standards - contains the\nstudy methodology used in Operations for developing the ranges of acceptable LPFs.\n\n\nIf the ISO determines that the LPF acceptable ranges require updating, loadflow\nanalysis shall be conducted by the ISO and VTF at a maximum of three distinct load\nlevels. These load levels may be modified as system demand dictates.\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n1.0500\n\n1.0000\n\n0.9500\n\n0.9000\n\n0.8500\n\n0.8000\n\n0.7500\n\n0.7000\n\n9,000 MW 18,000 MW 28,000 MW\n\n\n**New England LOAD**\n\n\n.\n\nThe TO and Transmission Customer have the responsibility to manage the LPF of all\nconnected distribution loads, and may do so by switching in-or-out-of-service,\ntransmission and distribution reactive Resources to meet the LPF Area’s voltage needs\nand, ultimately, LPF requirements.\n\nGenerators connected to the power transmission system and sub-transmission system\nshall comply with the voltage schedules in OP-12B (as applicable), or as established\nby the local TO, and operate all units with AVRs in-service, in automatic and regulating\nto a voltage schedule unless the units are:\n\n\n\n- Exempted from providing voltage control under the provisions of Master/Local\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nControl Center Procedure No.8 – Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator\nand Power System Stabilizer Outages (M/LCC 8); And\n\n- According to the limit of reactive capability provided under ISO New England\n\nOperating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand\nResponse Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology\nRegulation Resources, Appendix B - Generator and Asset Related Demand\nReactive Data Explanation of Terms and Instructions for Data Preparation for\nISO Form NX-12D (OP-14B).\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **LPF SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE AND EVALUATION**\n\nA. LPF Survey\n\nThe ISO shall conduct a survey of all LPF areas annually or more frequently as\ncircumstances may dictate. If the LPF survey shows a significant amount of LPF\npoints outside the established LPF curves during the surveyed period, the ISO may\nrequest additional data from TOs or Transmission Customers to determine the\nresponsible entity or entities causing the area’s non-compliance, within a reasonable\nand agreed upon timeframe. Further actions will be taken by the ISO as described in\nSection 1 of this OP.\n\nThe ISO is responsible for collecting the data, sharing the data with the VTF and, if\nnecessary, requesting additional data from TOs and/or Transmission Customers to\ncomplete this analysis. The TOs and Transmission Customers are required to\nprovide the requested data to the ISO within the timeframes noted within this\nprocedure.\n\nThe ISO shall perform the LPF survey and calculate the LPF at the transmission\nlevel, evaluate the LPF compliance, review trends and share the results with the\nVTF, M/LCC Heads and Reliability Committee. The TOs and Transmission\nCustomers are responsible for reviewing the LPF survey results on an area basis for\ntheir load and shall provide additional data if requested by the ISO, to determine the\nload entity or entities that were non-compliant. The Transmission Customers are\nresponsible for developing corrective actions when required.\n\nThe information gained from performing the LPF survey, if appropriate, may then be\nused by the ISO to create and update system models for conducting system studies\nand creating new operating voltage guides, as appropriate.\n\nB. LPF Assessment or Reliability Review\n\nChanges in the system or perceived changes in system performance will necessitate\na review and potential revision to one or more LPF’s requirements for the LPF Areas.\nThe ISO and LCC’s VTF members (as needed) shall conduct studies based on the\nmethodology described in Appendix B of this OP. Any resulting change in the LPF\nstandards will then be used for any succeeding LPF assessments.\n\nThe LPF standard is defined as a boundary, normally defined as a line or curve,\nwhere acceptable system performance occurs for LPF and load level combinations.\nThe area on one side of the curve yields unacceptable performance while the other\nside yields acceptable performance. The LPF standard, or curves, shall be\nestablished using pre or post-contingent voltage limits to establish where the limiting\ncurve point exists for defined test system load levels and sets of system conditions.\nFor example, in Figure 1 above, the area below the red curve and above the blue\ncurve would yield combinations of LPF and system load where reliable operation with\nrespect to voltage limit should be able to occur (for all lines in-service and specific\nfacility out conditions). The area above the red curve and below the blue curve\nshould result in either potential high or low post-contingent system operation,\nrespectively.\n\nLPF assessments determine the level of shunt compensation required to return the\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\narea in question to LPF compliance. The assessment determines the change in\nshunt capacitance, or reactance, to return the area’s LPF to within the defining\ncurves for a low voltage, or high voltage, exceedance, respectively. These shunt\ncompensation levels are reasonable estimates of the net relative change in area\npower factor that would need to occur to return the area to LPF compliance.\n\nWhen an Operating Issue is identified, the ISO shall perform a reliability review. For\nthe reliability review, if the LPF assessment shows that actual or near voltage limit\nexceedances from the system are strongly correlated with the LPF Area’s\nperformance, the results will then be compared against the area’s existing LPF\nstandards to determine the amount of LPF correction needed to improve reliability.\nThe ISO, after consultation with the VTF, shall determine the amount of shunt\ncapacitors or reactors needed to improve reliability. If the ISO determines that a new\nLPF standard is needed for any of the LPF Areas due to an Operating Issue, the VTF\nshall develop the new standard and share the new requirements through the annual\nreport on LPF.\n\nThe ISO shall annually provide a report to the M/LCC Heads and Reliability\nCommittee on LPF compliance by LPF Area, highlight future reactive targets and any\nOperating Issue created by the LPF performance. The report shall also include a\nsummary of the LPF survey, assessment or reliability review and list the noncompliance notifications issued by the ISO, either due to general area LPF noncompliance or for Operating Issues impacted by poor LPF as described in Part 1,\nabove. Any new LPF standards developed for any of the LPF areas shall be updated\nand shared with the Transmission Customers and TOs to provide the area’s LPF\nrequirements.\n\nThis OP is intended to complement other ISO New England Operating Procedures\nand ensure reliable operation of the transmission system. This OP also directly\nsupports the goals of ISO New England Operating Procedure No.19 Transmission Operation (OP-19), which prescribes criteria for the reliable\noperation of the transmission system including voltage and reactive limitations and\ncontingencies.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**OP-17 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to**\nthe RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n**Rev.

This OP identifies the power system parameters that each TO and\nMP are to meter and/or telemeter. This OP also establishes standards to verify that the\nequipment that each TO or MP installs can provide an appropriate level of accuracy and/or\nappropriate recordings for audit purposes. This OP further prescribes maintenance\nprocedures and schedules to be followed by each TO and MP so that the attainable level of\naccuracy may be realized.\n\nThere may be additional metering and telemetering requirements established by local state\nutility control and distribution utilities.\n\n**II.** **ACRONYMS & DEFINITIONS**\n\nISO CFE: Market Participant Communications Front End\n\nCNP: Communication Network Processor\n\nFiducial Value: A value to which reference is made in order to specify the accuracy of a\ntransducer. The Fiducial Value is the span except for transducers having a symmetrical\nreversible input and output. In this case, the Fiducial Value is half the span. (Reference:\nANSI/IEEE 460-1988, lapsed) Examples below:\n\n`o` Above the term “symmetrical reversible” means that the positive and negative full scale\n\nare equal in magnitude while opposite in polarity and halfway in the span is zero (0).\n\n`o` An AC Watt and/or VAr transducer where the inputs (voltage and current) are\n\nbidirectional (due to their nature of being ac) and where the values Watts and VArs that\nwould be derived from them based upon magnitude and angle difference are also\nbidirectional would therefore mean the Fiducial Value half span (the value of positive full\nscale). Given an example scale of -810 MW to 0 to +810 MW and an absolute error of 7\nMW would yield a % error of 0.86% (7 MW / 810 MW) meaning the Fiducial Value would\nbe 810 MW.\n\n`o` A transmitter device (such as the RFL 9800 series transmitter) that takes a signal\n\nrepresenting a telemetered MW and outputs a frequency shifted by the input would\nhave a Fiducial Value of the full span independent of the input since the output is\nbetween a min and max frequency. Given an example input scale of -300 MW to 0 to\n+300 MW via a -5V to 0 to +5V input signal and the associated output scale being 10 Hz\nto 20 Hz to 30 Hz, because the output is not reversible the Fiducial Value of the output\nis 20 Hz (Span = 30 Hz – 10 Hz). In that example if the absolute error in frequency was\n0.5 Hz, the % error would be 2.5% (0.5 Hz / 20 Hz). The receiver would similarly have\nits input as not being symmetrically reversible and so the Fiducial Value would be the\nfull span.\n\n`o` An AC Volt transducer has a symmetrical reversible input due to it being ac but the\n\noutput would be unidirectional (zero to full scale) and as such, the Fiducial Value would\nbe the full span but in that case, the full span is equal to the positive full scale as there\nis no negative side to the scale. Therefore, effective accuracy is similar to the Watt/VAr\n\n\n-----\n\ntransducer example where the positive full scale ends up being in the denominator.\n\nGIC: Geomagnetically Induced Current\n\nHVDC: any DC equipment that operates at 100kV or above.\n\nICCP: Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol\n\nLCC: Local Control Center\n\nModified: Modified or modify is defined for purposes of this Operating Procedure for new and\nNon-Emergency Replacement Equipment. For SCADA substation communications only,\nexamples of this would include non-emergency changes to NERC Bulk Electric System (BES)\nRTUs and expansion of BES substation facilities that include new BES RTU inputs. Periodic\nmaintenance of RTUs such as software updates would not be considered to be “modified”.\n\nMP: Market Participant\n\nNon-Emergency Replacement Equipment: is any equipment that does not interrupt or alter the\nflow of data critical to system operation when it fails and that, as such, does not need to be\nreturned to service immediately. This equipment has been categorized as maintenance\npriorities B and C in Table 1 of Appendix A to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 2\n(OP-2A). As provided for in OP-2A, the maintenance priority of any equipment not included in\nTable 1 shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the ISO, the LCC, and SCADA TOs.\n\nRTU: Remote Terminal Unit. Field station device to provide or receive telemetry to or from\nLCC or SCADA Servers.\n\nSCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n\nSCADA Server: A server running a SCADA application which communicates with RTU's and\nother systems to acquire data required by this OP.\n\nSCADA TO: any LCC or a TO that owns and maintains SCADA Servers, designated by ISO,\nas described above. LCCs or SCADA TOs are:\n\n Central Maine Power (TOP/LCC)\n Eversource (CONVEX, NSTAR and PSNH; TOP/LCC)\n National Grid (REMVEC; TOP/LCC)\n VELCO (TOP/LCC)\n United Illuminating (TO only)\n Versant (TO only)\n Rhode Island Energy (TO, currently National Grid is TOP providing SCADA\n\nservers)\n\nSTN (Shared Telecommunications Network): The STN is the network resulting from the\n\n\n-----\n\ninterconnection and sharing of the private telecommunications systems and networks owned\nby the TOs.\n\nTelemetering (telemetry): Transmission of measurable quantities using telecommunication\ntechniques. (reference: IEEE 610.2-1987, including analog and digital below)\n\n`o` **Analog - Telemetering in which some characteristic of the transmitter signal is**\n\nproportional to the quantity being measured.\n\n`o` **Digital - Telemetering in which a numerical representation is generated and**\n\ntransmitted, the number being representative of the quantity being measured.\n\nTie-Line Assets: A physical transmission line which connects a TO/MP to another TO/MP, a\nnon-MP or the 345 kV (or above) Pool Transmission Facility (PTF) system. Tie-Line Assets\nare also used to connect different sections of a TO/MP system that is divided by a Load Zone\nboundary. This definition supplements that contained in Tariff Section I – General Terms and\nConditions.\n\nTO: Transmission Owner\n\nTOP: Transmission Operator\n\nTransducer: A device that takes a signal or signals (Volts, Amps, etc.,) and converts it into\nanother signal or signals (milli-Amps, Volts, etc.). Most often used to convert secondary Volts\nand/or Amp quantities into a scaled signal usable by an RTU (mA or Volt) representing system\nVolts, Amps, Watts, VArs or Frequency values. Digital meters and digital relays that convert\nsignals into numerical values used for OP-18 compliance will be treated as transducers for this\nOP.\n\n**III.** **IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**A.

The metering, recording and telemetering requirements for each transmission line\n\ninterconnecting Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF) to systems outside of New England\nare:\n\n      - Metering and telemetering of instantaneous megawatts (MW) from the agreed upon\n\nmetering terminals of the line\n\n      - Metering and telemetering of instantaneous megavars (MVAr) from the agreed-upon\n\nmetering terminals of the line [except for High Voltage direct current (HVdc)\ninterconnection])\n\n\n-----\n\n      - Metering, recording and telemetering of megawatt hours (MWh) per hour (i.e. energy\n\nper hour)\n\n2. MW and MWh per hour metering shall be at the same terminal of each interconnection.\n\n3. The TO/MP and the non-TO/MP shall agree on the location of the metering terminal(s).\n\n4. Wherever feasible, both technically and economically, Data transmission in the ISO\n\nReliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) should be via the New\nEngland Shared Telecommunications Network.\n\n**B. Instantaneous Megawatts and Megavars**\n\n1. This data shall be telemetered to ISO.\n\n2. This data may also be required by other dispatch centers within either system and by\n\nsystems beyond the interconnecting systems.\n\n3. For new interconnections, and any upgrades of existing equipment, currently\n\nsupportable telemetering equipment shall be used and quantities shall be transmitted to\neach receiver location directly without retransmission (i.e., without an intermediate\nreceiver and transmitter).\n\n**C. Megawatt-hours per Hour**\n\n1. There shall be a device at each interconnection facility to record the hourly billing watt\nhours on site. In all new and upgraded installations, solid-state data recorders shall be\ninstalled.\n\n2. The MWh data shall be telemetered hourly to either ISO or the control center of the\n\ninterconnected system. If it is telemetered to ISO, it shall be telemetered via the\napplicable LCC or SCADA TO, that has responsibility for the particular interconnection\nline.\n\n3. The watt-hour data shall be compensated for line losses to the ISO RCA/BAA boundary.\n\n4. MWh may be recorded and telemetered as a net or as two quantities, MWh IN and\n\nMWh OUT.\n\n**V.** **METERING AND RECORDING FOR SETTLEMENTS**\n\n**A. Overall Requirements**\n\n1. MWh per hour (i.e. energy per hour) data is required for each Generator Asset, Tie-Line\n\nAsset and Load Asset. There is an option for Generator Assets, Tie-Line Assets and\nLoad Assets, subject to appropriate authorization, to have metering data submitted at\nthe subhourly 5-minute interval. The 5-minute data reported shall be calculated by\nmeasuring the generation or consumption energy in units of MWh in the 5-minute\ninterval and multiplying that value by 12 (resulting in an average generation or\nconsumption in units of MW during the interval). This 5-minute subhourly data reporting\noption shall also apply to all other settlement Watt-hour (Wh) and MWh requirements.\n\n2. In order for an Asset to be eligible to participate in one or more of the markets, the\n\nAsset shall have Wh metering as defined in this OP. The exception to this is in the case\nof intra-MP Tie-Line Assets as defined in Section V.D.2 of this OP.\n\n3. For Demand Response Resources (DRR), MWh per 5-minute interval data is required\n\nfor each Demand Response Asset (DRA). The 5-minute data reported shall be\ncalculated by measuring the consumption or generation in the 5-minute interval and\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiplying that value by 12 (resulting in an effective hourly consumption or generation).\nIn order for a DRA to be eligible to participate in one or more of the markets, the DRA\nshall have a Wh metering or recording device as defined in this OP.\n\n**B.

The MWh per hour data quantities shall be automatically recorded at no greater than an\n\nhourly interval in accordance with Section VIII.B.5 of this OP. If the option for submitting\n5-minute interval data is used, the quantities shall be automatically recorded at no\ngreater than the 5-minute interval.\n\n5. Wh meters shall be equipped with kilowatt-hour (kWh) or MWh registers which shall be\n\nread a minimum of once a month. The purpose of this register read is to validate hourly\ndata and allow for an adjustment, which corrects the sum of the hourly readings\nsubmitted to ISO during the month to the total energy actually metered. (See section\nX.D.7 for required energy comparison)\n\n6. The location of applicable Wh metering shall comply with this OP and be reported to\n\nISO by the responsible MP.\n\n7. The hourly MWh per hour data or subhourly data shall be reported to ISO to reflect the\n\nAsset at the Interconnection Point. For purposes of this OP, the Interconnection Point is\nhereafter defined as:\n\ni. the PTF boundary;\n\nii. the agreed upon point of interconnection between two TOs/MPs; or\n\niii. the agreed upon point of interconnection between a TO/MP and a non-MP.\n\nWh meters not located at the Interconnection Point shall be compensated for losses to\nthe Interconnection Point as follows:\n\na) Level I accuracy\n\nWh metering that is:\n\n     - physically located at the Interconnection Point, or\n\n     - **not physically located at the Interconnection Point but continuously compensated**\n\nwithin the Wh meter or Wh metering circuit for excitation and load losses to the\nInterconnection Point.\n\nb) Level II accuracy\n\nWh metering that complies with this OP, except that it is not physically located at the\nInterconnection Point, but the recorded meter data is compensated through external\ncalculations for excitation and load losses to the Interconnection Point. The\nintegration interval for the loss compensation calculations shall not exceed a onehour period, Compensation calculations shall be based on both real power (kW) and\n\n\n-----\n\nreactive power (kVAr or kQ) measurements. Voltage may be either measured or\nassumed constant.\n\nc) Level III accuracy\n\nExisting Wh metering without reactive recording capability that complies with this\nOP, and is not physically located at the Interconnection Point, may have its MWh\nrecorded meter data compensated through external calculations for excitation and\nload losses to the Interconnection Point. In such cases, the compensation\ncalculations shall be based on real power (kW) measurements, a fixed 95% power\nfactor, and voltage may be either measured or assumed constant. The integration\ninterval for the loss compensation calculations shall not exceed a one-hour period.\n\n8. For DRAs, the 5-minute (MWh) data submitted to the ISO in accordance with Manual M\n28 shall be either energy billing quality as defined in OP-18, Appendix C - Minimum\nAccuracy Standards For New And Upgraded Metering, Recording And Telemetering\nInstallations And For Calibration Of Existing Equipment (OP-18C) or in the case where\nmetering is installed specifically for the DRA (and will not be used for utility billing\npurposes), a metering system with an overall accuracy as defined in OP-18C may be\nused. Metering used for utility billing purposes is also known as revenue quality\nmetering.\n\n9. DC coupled Assets participating in one or more of the markets separately must meet\n\nthe following requirements:\n\na) DC Wh metering must be installed for each Asset.\nb) AC Wh metering compliant with this OP must be installed at or compensated to\n\nthe Interconnection Point.\n\nc) Reported interval MWh per hour values for each DC coupled Asset must sum to\n\nthe measured AC MWh per hour compensated to the Interconnection Point in\neach interval.\n\nd) Both unadjusted DC MWh per hour values and reported interval MWh per hour\n\nvalues for each DC coupled Asset shall be made available to all Lead MPs for\nthe Assets prior to reporting to ISO.\n\n**C. Generator Assets**\n\n1. Generator Assets directly connected to the 345 kV (or above) PTF system shall be\n\nmetered at the PTF boundary or compensated to the PTF boundary in accordance with\nSection V.B of this OP.\n\n2. Generator Assets directly connected to the PTF system at 230 kV or below where PTF\n\nboundary metering is used shall be metered at the PTF boundary or compensated to\nthe PTF boundary in accordance with Section V.B of this OP.\n\n3. Generator Assets directly connected to the PTF system at 230 kV or below where PTF\n\nboundary metering is not used shall be metered at:\n\n(i) the generator terminals in accordance with the terms of the applicable\nInterconnection Agreement,\n\n(ii) at the PTF boundary; or\n\n(iii) compensated to the PTF boundary in accordance with Section V.B of this\nOP.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Generator Assets not connected to the PTF system shall be metered at the\n\nInterconnection Point or compensated to the Interconnection Point in accordance with\nSection V.B of this OP. The Interconnection Point shall be determined in accordance\nwith the terms of the applicable Interconnection Agreement.\n\n**D. Tie-Line Assets**\n\n1. Tie-Line Assets shall have a Wh meter or in the case of intra-TO/MP tie-lines an\n\ninstantaneous watt meter to calculate Wh at the Interconnection Point or compensated\nto the Interconnection Point with the other TO/MP or non-MP unless otherwise agreed\nto by the parties involved or the PTF boundary as appropriate and in accordance with\nSection V.B of this OP.\n\n2. Intra-TO/MP tie-lines are Tie-Line Assets used to connect different sections of a TO/MP\n\nsystem that is divided by a Load Zone boundary. For these Tie-Line Assets, MWh per\nhour data derived from integrating instantaneous MW data used for Dispatch purposes\n(Section VI.) is acceptable provided the metering equipment meets the minimum\naccuracy standards defined in OP-18C.\n\n**E. Load Assets**\n\n1. Every Load Asset except DRAs shall have a Wh meter or be determined on an hourly\n\nbasis as an allocation of Wh meters. The Wh meter shall be located either at the\nInterconnection Point or compensated to the Interconnection Point in accordance with\nSection V.B of this OP.\n\n2. The load that is measured by a TO/MP Load Asset metering system may include PTF\n\nlosses. If the Load Asset metering system includes such PTF losses, these losses, as\ndetermined by the ISO State Estimator (SE) in accordance with the procedures\nembodied in Manual M-28, shall be supplied to the TO/MP by ISO, and shall be\nsubtracted from the total load as metered, to determine a TO/MP non-PTF demand.\n\n**VI.** **INTERNAL NEW ENGLAND METERING AND TELEMETERING FOR DISPATCH, MARKET,**\n**AND RELIABILITY PURPOSES**\n\n**A.

For all DRAs, data shall be submitted in 5minute intervals. For a DRR to provide TMSR or TMNSR, DRA telemetry values shall\nbe submitted at a minimum of every one minute. This data requirement recognizes that\nthe change detection logic employed by some RTUs is telemetered to the SCADA\nsystem only after a change in the data is detected by the RTU, and that the amount of\nchange may be different for each point in an RTU.\n\n3. Telemetered status data shall be made available to the local ICCP server or ISO CFE\n\nwithin four (4) seconds of a change reported by an RTU.\n\n**D. Telemetered Data Criteria**\n\nThe following communication paths shall be established to make the required telemetered\ndata available. Some paths are dependent upon the Asset being defined as dispatchable\nper OP-14.\n\n1. Generation data (Section VI.A) shall be made available to the LCC or SCADA TO in\n\nwhich the Asset resides. The LCCs and SCADA TOs shall make this data available to\nthe ICCP network.\n\na.

Some dispatchable types have additional data\nrequirements as specified in OP-14 that shall also be provided to ISO. ISO shall\nmake all of this data available to the ICCP network.\n\nb. If the Asset is dispatchable and the Asset nameplate generation capability as\n\ndefined by the NX-12 technical data is less than 15 MW, then the LCC or SCADA\nTO may request an exemption to providing this data. The LCC or SCADA TO shall\nsubmit the exemption request to ISO and provide a technical explanation as to why\nthe data cannot be obtained. ISO, at its sole discretion, shall grant or deny the\nexemption.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.

Station RTU inputs to SCADA Servers for non-BES facilities or Distributed Generation\n\nfacilities with less than 20MVA nameplate capacity shall use at least one transport listed\nfrom section VI.E.3.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe intent of the LCC or SCADA TO providing data to the ICCP network is to ensure\nthat the only possibility of single points of failure are individual non-redundant field\ndevices (RTUs). For generation facilities, this also adds redundancy when the LCCs\nare performing the TOP function.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6-1 shows the network redundancy and network configuration that LCCs and\nSCADA TOs must provide for all new or existing installations that are Modified.\n\nIf an LCC, SCADA TO or Generation Facility uses commercial carriers for leased lines,\nthen the circuits must be registered with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Agency (CISA’s) Telecommunications Service Priority\nprogram to ensure prioritized service and restoration, or with a comparable ISO\napproved program. Implementation dates are as described above.\n\nIf an LCC or SCADA TO uses cellular wireless services, then the service must be public\nsafety grade wireless such as FirstNet.\n\nUtility Owned (STN) Redundant and diversely ICCP Network **ICCP**\n\nTelecom Channels (By ISO) } routed to prevent single point of failure **Network**\n\nUtility Fiber Channel #2, Path #2 Site 2\n**or Commercial Communication** SCADA\nCommercial Vendor #2, Server(s)\n\nSite 1\n\nTechnology #2\n\nSCADA\n\nServer(s)\n\nSubstation RTU Field Inputs\n\nUtility Fiber Channel #1, Path #1\n**or Commercial Communication**\nCommercial Vendor #1, **LCC or SCADA TO**\nTechnology #1 **Transport\" – No Single**\n\n**Point of Failure**\n\nGeneration less than 20 MVA\n\nSingle Communication\n\nChannel allowed\n\n**Figure 6-1 EMS/SCADA Communications Overview for New or Modified Installations**\n\nThis design is for Transmission Owner NERC BES stations along with generation facilities\n20 MVA and above and the intent is to eliminate single points of failure for communication\npathways for a single station. Network transport devices that facilitate communications\nfor more than one station shall also be redundant to eliminate cascading data loss from\nmultiple stations. Dual RTUs are not necessary to meet the requirement of Figure 6-1.\n\nIn Figure 6-1 when referring to “Technology #1” and “Technology #2”, these must use a\ndifferent technology medium i.e. wireless 4G and wireless 5G would not be considered\ndifferent technology.\n\n\n**LCC or SCADA TO**\n\n**Transport\" – No Single**\n\n**Point of Failure**\n\n\n-----\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSee Appendix A for other details regarding ICCP server requirements and maintenance.\n\nLCCs and SCADA TOs shall have full SCADA Server functional equivalence at each\nControl Center location.

Telemetered Data Identification**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nOP-18F is a confidential document subject to the ISO New England Information\nPolicy. If access to OP-18F is needed, contact ISO Participant Support and\nSolutions as detailed on the ISO external website.\n\nISO, each LCC/SCADA TO, each TO and each MP shall uniquely and correctly identify the\n\ndata being supplied to the network using the format described in OP-18 A for CNP sourced\ndata and in OP-18F and OP-18G for ISO CFE data.\n\n**VII.** **METERING FOR POWER FACTOR MEASUREMENT PURPOSES**\n\nEach TO/MP shall submit to ISO the quantities necessary to calculate TO/MP lpf as prescribed\nin ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 17 - Load Power Factor and System\nAssessment (OP-17). A sufficient number of the necessary quantities shall be metered and\nrecorded so that the resulting lpf is a valid calculation.\n\n**VIII.** **EQUIPMENT STANDARDS FOR NEW AND UPGRADED INSTALLATIONS**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section specifies standards for metering, recording and telemetering equipment that each\nTO/MP installs in all new and upgraded facilities. A TO/MP may maintain or repair existing\nequipment with like or improved components, but each TO/MP shall choose equipment that\nmeets all the requirements of this OP and Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff when the equipment is\nbeing replaced for purposes other than maintenance or repair (i.e., for purposes of upgrading\nthe facility).\n\n**A. ANSI Standards**\n\nAll AC metering devices used shall conform to applicable American National Standard Institute\n\n(ANSI) C-12 standards as amended from time-to-time. HVdc metering devices shall meet\nor exceed the following accuracy requirements of ANSI standards as noted below in 1, 2,\nand 3.\n\n1. Integrated metering quantities, such as watt-hours and the associated demand\n\ncomponents shall conform to ANSI standard C12.\n\n2. Instruments or transducers for the analog or digital measurement of telemetered\n\nquantities, such as MW, shall conform to ANSI standards C39.1, C39.5 and C37.90.\n\n3. Instrument transformers shall conform to ANSI standard C57.13.\n\n**B. Specific ISO New England Standards**\n\n1. The design accuracy of individual components as well as overall systems shall conform\n\nto the standards contained in OP-18C.\n\n2. Electro-mechanical Wh meters shall not be installed.\n\n3. For all grounded wye system metering, three element meters and transducers shall be\n\nused. For all delta system (ungrounded) metering, two or three element meters and\ntransducers may be used.\n\n4. The requirement for data recorders and for integrated metering quantities shall be\n\nsatisfied with the types of equipment listed below. Either type may be used internally or\non interconnections with systems outside ISO.\n\n    - A data recorder shall be installed at the metering location. Data shall be retrieved\n\nfrom recorders by on-site or remote interrogation. Where the TOs/MPs agree on the\nneed for joint access to this recorded data, remote communications equipment is\nrecommended to be installed\n\n    - A multifunction meter shall be equipped with an interval data recorder capable of\n\nstoring at least 60 days of interval data and an internal clock. Data shall be retrieved\nfrom the meter by remote interrogation. Where the TOs/MPs agree on a need for\njoint access to this recorded data, the meter program shall be secured appropriately.\n\n    - The data recorder or multifunction meter equipped with an interval data recorder\n\nshall not be dependent on the alternating current (ac) voltage that it is metering as\nthe sole power source if an alternative power source exists at the metering location\n(such as an ac station service emergency panel feed, a direct current (dc) battery or\n“street power”).\n\n5. All data recorders shall be synchronized in time, within an accuracy of\n\n+/- 15 seconds, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nperiodically and when they are installed or returned to service after maintenance or\nrepair.\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Compensation for line and/or transformer losses, when used, shall be accomplished by\n\nusing Level I or Level II metering accuracy standards as defined in OP-18 Section\nIV.B.7 of this OP.\n\n7. DC metering associated with DC coupled Assets participating separately in any market\n\nshall be of equivalent accuracy and precision to AC meters meeting the ANSI C12\nstandard. Specifications for such devices shall be provided to the ISO and/or Host\nParticipant upon request.\n\n**IX.** **REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT FOR TELEMETERING**\n**SYSTEMS**\n\nTo ensure reliable data communications for telemetry, the telemetry equipment (RTU, Digital\nMetering, communication equipment etc.) located at and between stations [owned by an MP or\nDesignated Entity (DE)], the LCCs or SCADA TOs and ISO, the following supporting telemetry\ndata is required:\n\n1. The equipment shall not be dependent on a single ac power source. The power source\n\nshall be a station battery or an uninterruptible power source capable of supporting the\nanticipated load for at least eight hours.\n\n       - Communication only facilities (terminal or intermediate) shall have a battery rated for\n\nat least eight (8) hours and a suitable backup power source for extended periods.\n\n      - This includes telephone company equipment co-located with MP or DE equipment.\n\n      - “Communication facilities” noted above refer to all components (i.e.,: terminal and\nintermediate equipment, and communication media) along each path.\n\n2. At stations where two battery systems are present, it is desirable that each of them be\n\nmade capable of being a power source for the equipment.\n\n3. The equipment shall be capable of operating in a temperature range of -20°C to +50 °C\n\nfor equipment within the control building or -40 °C to +50 °C for equipment installed in\nother outdoor enclosures. This temperature range is based upon the conditions that\ncould exist when the ac power source is lost and as a result, air conditioning or heating\nis lost.\n\n4. The configuration/connection of communication circuits shall be designed so that a\n\nproblem on one circuit does not cause a problem on another (i.e., the problem does not\npropagate). There shall be no single point of failure that leads to communication loss\nfor more than one station.\n\n5. Alarms shall be provided to the appropriate LCC or SCADA TO indicating the status of\n\nequipment covered by this section.\n\n**X.** **TESTING, CALIBRATION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS**\n\n**A. Overall Requirements**\n\nEach TO/MP is responsible for properly maintaining its metering, recording and telemetering\n\nequipment in accordance with applicable ANSI standards as amended from time-to-time.\nThe specific standards for testing, calibration and maintenance are put forth in this section.\nThe accuracy standards to be observed are summarized in OP-18C.\n\n**B. Overall Telemetering System Test**\n\nWhenever transducers and/or telemetering systems are tested, an overall system test shall\n\n\n-----\n\nalso be conducted. This system test includes the use of the calibrated transducers output\nas an input to the telemetry system. All receiving devices shall be verified against the\napplied input.\n\n**C. Telemetry Component Tests**\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of telemetered data, each TO/MP shall do one of the following:\n\n1. Use manual or computerized routines to check telemetered quantities (MW, MVAr & kV)\n\nagainst each other, revenue meter quantities and/or against derived values of an SE, to\nidentify unreasonable values at least one day per calendar month as detailed in Section\nX.C.1.a of this OP. This option may only be used for equipment after the initial\ninstallation (or replacement) test where IX.C.2 (below) would apply for initial installation\n(or replacement).\n\na. Each single day check shall include 24 data samples for each telemetered point, 1\n\nfor each hour of the day.\n\n`o` While individual hour samples may have variations that exceed tolerances, noted\n\nbelow, where six or more consecutive samples exceed the tolerance in 1-day\nappropriate calibration, repairs or replacement actions shall be taken.\n\n`o` Each sample may be from a single point in time within the hour or\n\naveraged/integrated over the hour interval.\n\n`o` Voltage variance, as compared against below tolerances, is each telemetered\n\nphase-phase voltage compared against at least one of the two below:\n\n       - The SE resultant bus voltage associated with the telemetered voltage, given\n\nin, or corrected to, phase-phase\n\n**NOTE**\n\nConcerning average of telemetered voltages, when less than three voltages (of\ncomparable phase relationship) are measured at the same substation bus, additional\npoints of reference are needed for comparison. Other points of reference may include,\nbut are not limited to, adjacent bus voltages, nearby scheduled voltages, or bus voltage\nin an SE.\n\n       - The average of all non-zero telemetered voltages that are phase-phase on\n\nthe same nominal voltage level at the substation. Busses at the same voltage\nlevel that are not tied shall be treated separately.\n\nb. The tolerances for acceptable MW, MVAr and kV telemetered quantities are as\n\nfollows:\n\n`o` Watts: +/- 10 MW or +/- 4.5% of the largest fiducial value\n(whichever is smaller)\n\n`o` VArs: +/- 30 MVAr\n\n`o` Voltage: +/- 5 kV for 345 kV systems\n\n+/- 4 kV for 230 kV systems\n\n+/- 3 kV for 115 kV systems\n\n+/- 2 kV for 69 kV systems\n\n+/- 3% for systems below 69kV\n\n\n-----\n\nc. The check above shall not be required for MVAr quantities if the MVAr quantities are\n\nmeasured from the same device that measures the telemetered MW quantities.\n\n`o` The purpose for this is that measurement drift of a device measuring both would\n\ncause errors in both MW and MVAr. Also, MVAr variances are often obscured by\ntransformer losses or SE solutions that are not perfect.\n\n`o` With the bus-net method, MVAr quantities that originate from a different device\n\nthan the associated MW telemetry would not be exempt from a MVAr bus-net\neven if the other telemetry on the bus had its MW and MVAr quantities measured\nfrom the same device.\n\n`o` If a MVAr bus-net is needed, VAr losses can be estimated based upon\n\ntransformer test data to mitigate bus-net VAr error.\n\n2. Calibrate or test the accuracy of transducers and telemetering systems according to\n\nmanufacturer’s procedures, on the following schedule:\n\nTransducers: at least once every six years\n\nAnalog Telemetry: at least once every twelve months\n\nDigital Telemetry: at least once every six years\n\nWhen tests are performed on transducers, errors shall not exceed accuracy limits\nstated in OP-18C. If during the test, errors exceed this value, the device shall be\nrecalibrated, repaired or replaced as necessary to attain that accuracy.\n\nDigital telemetry employing analog to digital converter(s) (ADC), the gain and offset\ncharacteristics of which are continuously monitored, and reported to SCADA, by ADC\nreference values that are within accuracy limits stated in OP-18C, shall be exempt from\nperiodic calibration requirements. When accuracy limits stated in OP-18C are\nexceeded, the equipment shall be recalibrated, repaired or replaced as necessary to\nattain that accuracy. This digital telemetry test exemption may only be used for\nequipment after the initial installation (or replacement) accuracy test.\n\n**D. Watt-hour Meters**\n\n1. All Wh meters shall be tested by comparison to a solid-state Wh standard that is\n\ntraceable to the NIST as outlined in Section X.F of this OP. Testing shall include an\ninspection, verification, and analysis of the metering system excluding instrument\ntransformers.\n\n2. HVDC Wh meters - dc Wh metering equipment using voltage inputs for current and\n\nvoltage sensing shall conform to the following requirements. See Figure 9-1.\n\na. DC test voltage source equipment for generating current and voltage inputs to the\n\nmeter shall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.\n\nb. Voltmeters used for monitoring the input voltages to the dc meter during the test\n\nshall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.\n\nc. Meter nominal test voltage shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the\n\nnominal operating voltage of the metered line.\n\nd. Meter “full load test amperes” shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the\n\nnominal operating current of the metered line.\n\ne. The test points for the meter shall be as follows:\n\n`o` Full load test amperes\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` 10% of full load test amperes\n\n`o` 50% of full load test amperes\n\n`o` 150% of full load test amperes\n\nf. If meter pulse outputs are compared to calculated target values, and pulses from a\n\nstandard, to determine meter accuracy, then worksheets detailing the test conditions\nand target pulse counts shall be made available prior to testing the meter. See\nTable 9-1, below.\n\ng. If the meter is compensated to account for different operating modes of the metered\n\ncircuit, then the meter shall be tested with compensation activated at each of the test\npoints defined above. The operating modes that represent the normal operating\nconditions shall be tested as a part of periodic testing. All operating modes shall be\ntested upon commissioning.\n\nh. For engineered (custom) metering systems, a hard copy of the current meter\n\nprogram shall accompany the meter test documentation.\n\ni. If both revenue meter data and telemetry data are provided by the same meter, then\n\nprovisions shall be made to continue the telemetry while the meter is out of the\nmeasurement circuit during the test.\n\nj. If redundant meter schemes are used, then the generation of any alarms or status\n\nflags due to differences in measurement between the meters caused by the testing\nshall be documented. If redundant recorders are used, then differences in recorded\npulse totals due to the testing shall also be documented.\n\nk. If redundant meter schemes are used, then the start and stop time as well as the\n\naccumulated test energy for the meter under test shall be documented. In addition,\nthe start and stop time as well as the accumulated energy during the test period\nshall be noted for the in-service meter.\n\nl. A field standard meter that has been programmed identical to the meter under test\n\nmay be used for certification provided that it meets the accuracy and certification\nrequirements of Section IX.F of this OP.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example Test Scheme for a DC Meter with Voltage Inputs.**\n\nO V1 (+) O V1 (+)\nO V1 (-) O V1 (-)\n\nO V2 (+) O V2 (+)\n\nDC Voltage Source **+ O** O V2 (-) O V2 (-)\n\n(test) **-  O** O I1 (+) DC Meter O I1 (+)\n\nO I1 (-) O I1 (-)\n\nO I2 (+) O I2 (+)\nO I2 (-) O I2 (-)\n\nVolt Meter **+ O**\n\n(test) **-  O** Pulse Recorder\n\nDC Voltage Source **+ O**\n\n(test) **-  O**\n\nVolt Meter **+ O**\n\n(test) **-  O**\n\n**Figure 10-1**\n\n**Example Pulse Target Worksheet**\n\n**Test Conditions - Equation 1** **Uncompensated** **Meter** **Meter**\n\n**(Import / South)** **Reference** **Reading** **Standard**\n\n**Energy**\n\n**Reading**\n\n**Current** **Pulses*** **Pulses*** **Pulses***\n\nI1:0.5V(225A)\n506.25\nI2:0.5V(225A)\n\nI1:2.222(1000A)\n1125\nI2:2.222(1000A)\n\nI1:5V(2250A)\n2531.25\nI2:5V(2250A)\n\nI1:7.5V(3375A)\n3796.88\nI2:7.5V(3375A)\n\n- Pulses are 0.2 MWh / pulse. 225A (10%) test uses pulse over 30 min, all other test\n\nconditions use pulses for 15 min.\n\n**Table 9-1**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||O V1 (+) O V1 (-) O V2 (+) O V2 (-) DC Meter O I1 (+) O I1 (-) O I2 (+) O I2 (-)|\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n\n|Test Conditions - Equation 1 (Import / South)|Col2|Uncompensated Reference Energy|Meter Reading|Meter Standard Reading|Meter error|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Voltage|Current|Pulses*|Pulses*|Pulses*|(%)|\n|V1: 5V(450kV) V2:-5V(-450kV)|I1:0.5V(225A) I2:0.5V(225A)|506.25||||\n|V1: 5V(450kV) V2:-5V(-450kV)|I1:2.222(1000A) I2:2.222(1000A)|1125||||\n|V1: 5V(450kV) V2:-5V(-450kV)|I1:5V(2250A) I2:5V(2250A)|2531.25||||\n|V1: 5V(450kV) V2:-5V(-450kV)|I1:7.5V(3375A) I2:7.5V(3375A)|3796.88||||\n|* Pulses are 0.2 MWh / pulse. 225A (10%) test uses pulse over 30 min, all other test conditions use pulses for 15 min.||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n3. DC Wh metering for DC coupled Assets participating separately in any market shall\n\nconform to the following requirements:\n\na. DC test voltage source equipment for generating current and voltage inputs to the\n\nmeter shall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.\n\nb. Voltmeters used for monitoring the input voltages to the dc meter during the test\n\nshall be traceable to NIST for accuracy.\n\nc. Meter nominal test voltage shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the DC\n\nvoltage rating of the inverter.\n\nd. Meter “full load test amperes” shall be the meter input voltage corresponding to the\n\nDC ampere rating of the inverter.\n\ne. The test points for the meter shall be as follows:\n\n`o` Full load test amperes and nominal test voltage\n\n`o` Full load test amperes and 50% of nominal test voltage\n\n`o` 50% of full load test amperes and nominal test voltage\n\n`o` 50% of full load test amperes and 50% of nominal test voltage\n\nf. Where meter pulse outputs are compared to calculated target values, and pulses\n\nfrom a standard, to determine meter accuracy, worksheets detailing the test\nconditions and target pulse counts will be made available prior to testing the meter.\n\n4. At a minimum, AC Wh meters shall be tested by one of the following two methods:\n\na) Series test with external loads applied [permitted for testing either induction or solid\nstate Wh meters].\n\ni. “As-Found” series test performed at operating or nameplate voltage under the\n\nfollowing three conditions:\n\n     - Full load (FL) at the meter test ampere (TA) rating and unity power factor\n\n     - Light load (LL) at 10% of the meter TA rating and unity power factor\n\n     - Power factor (PF) at the meter TA rating and 0.5 power factor lag\n\nii. The series test results shall be within the following accuracy limits:\n\nTest Condition Accuracy Limit\n\nFL +/- 0.2% error\n\nLL +/- 0.3% error\n\nPF +/- 0.5% error\n\niii. The testing of any Wh meter with bi-directional functionality shall be tested for\n\naccuracy in both the forward (delivered) and reverse (received) directions for all\nAssets except those for Asset Related Demands (ARDs).\n\niv. In addition to the “As-Found” series tests, all induction Wh meters shall have an\n\n“As-Found” individual element balance test performed. The individual elements\nshall be tested at operating or nameplate voltage, at FL test amps, and unity\npower factor. The individual element test results shall be within 1.0% of each\nother.\n\n\n-----\n\nv. If the “As-Found” test results are outside the stated accuracy limits in section\n\nX.D.4.a.ii, then the meter shall be adjusted as closely as practical to 0.0% error\nor scheduled for replacement as soon as possible. The final “As-Left” test results\nshall be within the stated accuracy limits.\n\nvi. Any induction Wh meter found outside of +/- 2.0% error (at any test condition)\n\nshall be adjusted and scheduled for replacement as soon as practical.\n\nb) Single point three-phase test using the actual in-service load and meter uncompensated\n\n[not permitted for testing induction type Wh meters].\n\ni. “As- Found\" three-phase tested at actual in-service voltage, current, and power\n\nfactor; provided that:\n\n     - voltage is within the range specified by the meter manufacturer\n\n     - current is within the meter's load range between light-load (LL) and class\n\namps of the meter, and\n\n     - power factor is between unity and 0.5 lagging or leading\n\nii. The single point three-phase test results must be within the following accuracy\n\nlimits:\n\nTest Condition Accuracy limit\n\nActual in-service load +/- 0.2% error\n\niii. If the \"As-Found\" test results are outside the stated accuracy limits, then the\n\nmeter shall be adjusted as closely as practical to a 0.0% error or promptly\nreplaced. The final \"As-Left\" test results shall be within the stated accuracy\nlimits.\n\niv. Any solid-state Wh meter found with accuracy tests outside the limits specified in\n\nsection X.D.4.b.ii shall either be adjusted and scheduled for replacement as soon\nas practical; or, promptly replaced.\n\n5. Meters with compensation for line and/or transformer losses shall be either one or the\n\nother of the following:\n\n  - Series tested with and without the compensation activated at the test points as\n\ndefined in Section X.D.4.a of this OP; or\n\n  - Single point tested with compensation checked by comparison of compensated and\n\nuncompensated pulse data channels.\n\n6. In-service testing of Wh meters shall be conducted with the frequency established in the\n\nlocal state utility control and distribution utility requirements for retail loads such as\nAsset Related Demands (ARDs). All other Assets, with noted exception, shall be tested\nwith the following frequency: all Wh meters shall be tested at least once per calendar\nyear, with the exception that non-induction type Wh meters, the operation of which is\nmonitored daily, shall be tested at least once every six calendar years. Generator\nAssets that are not Settlement Only Resources and have a registered summer and\nwinter claimed capability of less than 1 MW shall be tested with the frequency\nestablished in the local state utility control and distribution utility requirements for retail\nloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. Periodic Energy Comparison\n\na) Data recording equipment external to the meter shall be checked monthly by\n\ncomparing a summation of the hourly demand readings with the kWh registered on\nthe Wh meters for the same period of time. When only small quantities (less than\n7,200 MWh in one month) have been registered, comparison is required every two\nmonths using two months of data. The difference in the sum of hourly demand\nreadings and the kWh registered on the Wh meter shall be less than the value of the\nWh meter transformer ratio multiplier. If this difference is greater, then the\ninstallation shall be reviewed and tested if the discrepancy is not explainable. This\nrequirement is not applicable to DC meters for DC-coupled Assets participating\nseparately in any market.\n\nb) For DRAs, data recording equipment external to the meter shall be checked at least\n\nannually by comparing a summation of the hourly demand readings with the kWh\nregistered on the Wh meter for at least one month. If hourly data is available from\nthe pulse source meter, then comparison shall take place at the hourly level.\n\n8. The continuity of meter readings shall be maintained during tests either by use of a\n\nportable meter or other suitable methods. Note: use of the single point test method\nshall provide for continuity of both readings and data. A Wh meter test may be\nconducted during a period of no load or when the load is constant and the reading\nadjusted upon completion of the test. Pulse data shall also be adjusted upon\ncompletion of the test. If this is not practical, then other methods shall be used to\nsegregate pulses registered due to the test from pulses based on registration of power\nflow.\n\n**E. Instrument Transformers**\n\nScheduled tests of instrument transformers shall be conducted only if all other tests fail to\nexplain a discrepancy. The testing procedure shall conform to the manufacturer’s\nspecifications and ANSI C57.13.\n\n**F. Test Equipment**\n\nTest equipment used in the calibration of instrument transformers or transducers shall be\ncertified to values of accuracy and precision which are at least twice as accurate as the\nrequired accuracy of the equipment under test. Non-induction type Wh standards of 0.1%\nor better accuracy shall be used in the testing of Wh meters. All Wh standards shall be\ncertified correct every twelve months.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nTraceability refers to relating individual measurement results to NIST measurement\nsystems through an unbroken chain of comparisons.\n\nAll Wh standards shall be certified by comparison with laboratory standards whose\naccuracy is traceable to NIST. The standard certification values may be determined by the\nuse of data obtained through round-robin procedures between TOs/MPs, provided that at\nleast one of the laboratories maintains standards traceable to NIST. Standards used for\nthe purpose of calibrating voltage and current transducers shall be of the same sensing\ntype (e.g., Root Mean Square (RMS) or average) as the transducers under test. All\ntelemetry standards shall be certified at least once every 24 calendar months.\n\nThe tests and calibrations shall be performed at ambient temperatures recommended by\n\n\n-----\n\nthe manufacturers of the test equipment and the equipment under test.\n\nInstrumentation used to check the tone modulating frequency for data transmission shall\nhave a minimum definition of 0.001 Hertz. The dc ammeter or voltmeter used to measure\ninput signals shall have a minimum accuracy of +/- 0.05%.\n\n**G. Record Keeping and Auditing**\n\nEach TO/MP shall maintain records of the testing, calibration and verification of all metering\nand telemetering equipment which is required to be installed pursuant to the provisions of\nthis OP. The records shall include:\n\n     - Entity name\n\n     - Element (line, bus, transformer, etc.) name covered by telemetry\n\n     - Name of telemetering device (or system)\n\n      - The dates of testing, calibration or verification\n\n     - % error of as-found (and as-left if recalibrated or replaced)\n\n     - A note, if as-found is not within accuracy tolerance\n\n      - Action(s) taken (if applicable) including date(s) of action(s)\n\nThese records shall be retained for a minimum of the two most current testing (or\nverification) cycles or since the last audit (whichever is greater) and shall be available to\nISO and the LCC upon request.\n\n**H.

Effective March 1, 2023, the TP shall provide aggregate models for each\ndistribution substation with SORs comprising generation that totals over 1 MW.\nIn the Year N case, the aggregate models shall include existing SORs. The\naggregate inverter models can be interconnected to a radial distribution bus,\nwhere the distribution bus is connected to the associated transmission bus with\na delta (system side) - wye (inverter side) distribution transformer (e.g.\n115/13.kV). If no existing transformer is available, the aggregate model shall\ninclude an interconnecting transformer with parameters provided by the Short\nCircuit Working Group. ISO shall provide a list of SORs and TOs shall review\nand ensure that double counting of SOR assets does not occur in the ASPEN\ncase with other models.\n\n**NOTE: When a distribution substation is supplied from more than one**\ntransmission substation, the SOR aggregate model will be connected to the\ndistribution substation in a manner that reflects the splitting of short circuit current\nfrom the distribution system to the transmission system while minimizing the\nextent of the distribution system that needs to be represented in the model. This\nmodeling approach is meant to capture splitting of short circuit current from the\naggregate model through the distribution system to the transmission system and\nnot require additional modeling of the distribution system.\n\nIf there is no distribution substation in the ASPEN case then the aggregate SOR\nmodel will be connected to the closest transmission substation.\n\n\n-----\n\nTPs shall provide the data in the format as described in Section VI.B of OP-16K.\n\nThe short circuit data submitted by a TP shall be consistent with the other data\nrequired by OP-16 (i.e. NX-9 data).\n\nTPs shall provide periodic updates per ISO’s request for the current system according\nto the schedule in Table 1.

In the data that the TP provides in the\nOLR and CHF, each TP shall:\n\ni. Include change files that compare the revised case to the original case. The\noriginal case shall be the most recent Year N Case that is posted on the\nSCWG ShareFile.\n\na. If multiple incremental change files are provided and order of\n\nimplementation is important, then the TP shall number the change files\nto indicate the order of implementation.\n\nii. Verify that all of the changes are made to equipment owned by the TP only\nand that no changes are made to the facilities of another TP, TO or GO.\n\niii. Include branch impedance for interconnecting Generator equipment if it is\nowned by the TP. However, the TP shall not modify equipment data for\nGenerator equipment as described in Section IV of this OP-16 K if the\nequipment is not owned by the TP\n\niv. Use border buses to reflect TP ownership changes in line sections.\n\nv. Make any hidden buses visible\n\nvi. To the extent possible, avoid changing the graphical coordinates of facilities.\n\nIf the TP does not utilize the ASPEN OneLiner software, data shall be provided to ISO\nin a manner approved by ISO such that it can be easily translated and integrated into\nan OLR short circuit case.\n\nWith each submittal of short circuit data, each TP shall provide documentation that\nlists the changes submitted. The document shall include RSP Project List and asset\ncondition list project identification numbers[2] where applicable.\n\n2 The RSP Listing and asset condition list are available at\n\n[http://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/system-plans-studies/rsp](http://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/system-plans-studies/rsp)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Year N+5 Case Reviews**\n\nTPs shall perform periodic reviews of the Year N+5 Case provided by ISO according to\nthe schedule in Table 1. The review shall include future facilities that ISO has included\nin the case since the last update and any modeling revisions that are needed in the\nmost recent Year N+5 Case.\n\nIf, after its review, a TP determines that it is necessary to revise the Year N+5 Case\nthat is provided by ISO, that TP shall submit an OLR file representing the revised Year\nN+5 Case short circuit case and associated CHF. The files shall meet the\nrequirements for current year (N) as described above. With each submittal of short\ncircuit data revisions, the TP shall provide documentation that lists the revisions\nsubmitted.\n\ni. Modeling of SORs in the Year N+5 case shall follow the method outlined in\nSection VI.A.vi where the the Transmission Planner shall provide the\naggregated models with existing SORs as updated to reflect any Proposed Plan\nApplication generation changes or retirements.\n\n**B. Data Submittal Method**\n\nThe following shall be submitted electronically via the TP subdirectory on the SCWG\nShareFile site, when changes are submitted as a part of an update:\n\ni. Update the change log to document changes and revisions\n\nii. ASPEN OLR file with changes/revisions included\n\niii.

When downloaded and_\n_printed, this document becomes UNCONTROLLED, and users should check the Internet web site to ensure_\n_that they have the latest version._\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**I.** **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**\n\nData for all series reactive devices, including Smartvalve devices, designated as\npart of the Bulk Electric System[1] (BES) or connecting to the New England\nTransmission System[2] at a voltage of 69 kV or greater shall be provided by the\nTransmission Owners and Market Participants who own the equipment.[3]\n\nIf a series reactive device cannot be switched in or out independently of the\nassociated line, the impedance and rating information for the series reactive device\nmay be combined with the line data and the combined total may be submitted on a\nsingle NX-9A form. On all new and revised NX-9A forms, if a series reactive\ndevice is combined with a line and reported on a single combined NX-9A form, the\nMP or TO shall update the Participant Equipment Notes field to indicate that the\nNX-9A form includes the series reactive device information.\n\nData for series reactive devices connected at voltages that are less than 69 kV\nmay be required when ISO determines that the data is necessary for reliable\noperation of the New England Transmission System. When required by ISO, the\nTO or MP shall submit the data within thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s\nnotification.\n\nFor Smartvalve devices, a document (.pdf format) defining the various impedance\nsettings shall be included as a file attachment to the NX-9H form.\n\n**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nThe NX-9H form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot\nbe modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for\nall non-ISO fields via the NX Application.\n\nThe circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment\nand thereafter maintained by ISO.\n\nSelect the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment. Terminals\nare created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO NX-9\n[Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)\nneeded.\n\nTo remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service\ncheckbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is\nretiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to a\nchange in configuration.\n\n1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section\n\nI.2.2.\n\n3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners\n\n(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants\nfor Generator Assets (collectively MPs).\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo assist in completing the NX-9H form, completed sample NX-9H forms are\nattached (Examples 1, 2 and 3).\n\n**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nFacility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole\nnumber) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures\nfor Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”\n(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0\nCollaborative Development of Rating Procedures. A facility rating shall equal the\nrating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay loadability limits[4],\nand shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and any\nother equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This requirement\ndoes not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it successor\nstandards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay setting to create\na more limiting thermal rating for a facility.\n\nThe NX-9H form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)\nand winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings. The ambient\ntemperature (reported in Fahrenheit) and wind speed (reported in feet per second)\nused to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating set. If ratings\nfor special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9H form, comments\nthat describe the associated circumstances for use of the special ratings are\nrequired. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement as to the\nauthority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and distribution of\nthese special ratings.\n\n**IV.** **CHARACTERISTRIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nIndicate the device type by selecting capacitor, inductor or reactor in the Device\nType field.\n\nProvide positive sequence impedance data in percent on a 100 MVA base.\nImpedance data provided shall represent the incremental impedance that is\nrealized when the series device is in service. Impedance for the associated line will\naccount for total impedance when the series device is out of service. Impedance\non NX-9H forms shall be calculated and provided out to at least the 3[rd] decimal\nplace.\n\nR = resistance\nX = reactance\n\nFor Smartvalve devices, provide the impedance values expected to be in use the\nmajority of the time.\n\n**V.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**\n\n4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay\n\nacts.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nAny time an NX-9H form is modified or created, a brief description of the reason(s)\nfor the entry shall be provided in the Revision Comments field. It will provide a\nwritten record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in\nthe field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9H form. For\nexample: Rating changes due to replacement of switch XYZ.\n\nThis data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9H form review and approval process.\n\n**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**\n\nThe Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other\npertinent or operational information. For example: In the normal configuration,\nequipment is bypassed and out of service.\n\nFields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is\navailable to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only by\nthe MP or TO owning the record.\n\nEquipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9H form is updated. MPs and\nTOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer\npertinent.

The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall only use PSS/E standard library models\n\nunless they are for equipment covered by section I.b or I.c below. The PSS/E\nstandard library models used shall not be identified by NERC to be prohibited\nor discouraged for use in interconnection-wide cases.\n\nb. For equipment installed with a new type of technology[3] that cannot be\n\nrepresented by PSS/E standard library models that is first brought in service\nafter October 12, 2021, user-written (i.e. user-written, user or user-defined)\nmodels will be allowed on a temporary basis, provided there is a written\ncommitment from the equipment owner, with written acknowledgement from\nSiemens PTI, to develop an appropriate standard library model in PSS/E at\nthe earliest opportunity in the software development cycle.\n\nc. For equipment installed and first brought into service before October 12,\n\n1 An increasing number of reactive resources are being used to provide the same essential reliability services\n(ERS) as generation resources to ensure reliability of the BPS such as voltage control, frequency control,\nand ramping/balancing capability. Applicability of relevant equipment to consider as Dynamic Reactive\n[Resources for MOD-032 can be seen in the Table 1 of the Transmission Connected Dynamic Reactive](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/202002_Transmissionconnected_Resources_DL/TCR_Whitepaper_December_2019_PC_Approved_04242020.pdf)\n[Resources and HVDC Equipment – Assessment of Applicability in Reliability Standards NERC SAMS White](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/202002_Transmissionconnected_Resources_DL/TCR_Whitepaper_December_2019_PC_Approved_04242020.pdf)\n[Paper, February 2019](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/202002_Transmissionconnected_Resources_DL/TCR_Whitepaper_December_2019_PC_Approved_04242020.pdf)\n[2 Bulk Electric System (BES) as defined in Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf)\n3 For the purposes of this provision, a new type of technology is one which has never been represented in\nthe PSS/E standard library. For example, at the time of the addition of this provision, the PSS/E standard\nlibrary did not contain any model that represented grid forming inverter technology and so this is considered\na new type of technology for the purposes of this provision. An enhancement to a technology that is already\ncaptured in the standard library, such as an upgrade to a static excitation system or a newer version of gridfollowing inverter controls used to connect a wind or solar project do not constitute a new type of technology\nfor this provision.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n2021, for which a standard library file has never been provided, user-written\nmodels are acceptable, though the equipment owner is encouraged to\ntransition to an appropriate PSS/E standard library model as soon as\npossible.\n\nFor a new or modified facility with an associated System Impact Study (SIS) or\nProposed Plan Application (PPA), the models used for the SIS or PPA shall be\nconsidered the data submittal for dynamic equipment modeling. For equipment\nowned by generators, the ISO will perform the initial upload of this model into the\nDynamics Data Management System (DDMS). TOs and Qualified Transmission\nProject Sponsors shall perform the initial upload of the model into DDMS for\nequipment that they own. TOs, Lead MPs, or Interconnection Customers for\nplanned equipment installations shall provide subsequent recertifications prior to\ninitial energization using the DDMS, when requested by ISO. Prior to energizing the\nfacility, TOs, Lead MPs or Interconnection Customers shall provide documentation\nusing DDMS to support the dynamic models representing facilities as-built including\nbut not limited to manufacturer models, test reports verifying models and nameplate\ndata and shall include updated PSS®/E files such as .dyr, .dll and .raw files.\n\nSystem load dynamic demand characteristics were developed by ISO and\nTransmission Planners in conjunction with subject matter experts. Each\nTransmission Customer, TO or Distribution Provider (DP) shall review the dynamic\nload model characteristics and provide an update as required per an ISO data\nrequest and provide the response as described with the data request.\n\n**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n   - The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall provide equipment data models, as described and\n\ndefined in the Compliance Bulletin – [MOD-032 and ISO New England’s Model](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2015/06/iso_new_england_compliance_bulletin_mod_032.pdf)\n[Data Requirements and Reporting Procedures in the requested PSS[®]/E version](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2015/06/iso_new_england_compliance_bulletin_mod_032.pdf)\nformat.\n\n   - Questions regarding ISO-specific dynamic data and dynamic demand data\n\nrequirements should reference “MOD-032 and OP-16 Appendix J” and should be\ndirected to the ISO Participant Support department.\n\n**III.** **DYNAMICS DATA SUBMITTAL SCHEDULE**\n\nThe applicable MP, Lead MP or TO shall submit dynamics data for a new facility\nand modification to an existing facility consistent with the schedules defined in\nSection I.3.9 of the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services\nTariff (Tariff). Prior to energizing the facility, the applicable MP, Lead MP or TO\nshall provide updates to represent the facility as-built.\n\nThe MP, Lead MP or TO shall verify the accuracy of existing system load dynamic\ndemand characteristics and/or submit updated characteristics within 45 calendar\ndays or longer if defined in the ISO data request. Data shall be provided using the\nDynamics Data Management System (DDMS) or in the manner as otherwise\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\ndescribed in the ISO data request.\n\nISO shall review all submitted data to verify that it is complete, reasonable and\nconsistent with the related data and with the reason for the revision. ISO shall notify\nthe MP, Lead MP, or TO of any discrepancies. The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall\nprovide corrections to the data within 90 calendar days of the notification of the\ndiscrepancies, as defined in MOD-032.\n\n**IV.** **EXPLANATION OF DATA CHANGES**\n\nWhen dynamics model data changes, the MP, Lead MP, or TO shall include with all\nDDMS submittals the updated PSS®/E files such as .dyr, .dll and .raw files needed\nto model the facility as configured. A copy of the manufacturer nameplate either by\ndocument (.pdf format) or digital photograph (.tif or .jpg formats) if changed, and the\nequipment test report document verifying dynamic model and parameters (.pdf\nformat) shall be submitted to support the dynamic model changes (this is not\nrequired for component replacements that do not alter capability or dynamic\nperformance). The MP, Lead MP, or TO shall include a brief description of the\nreason(s) for the change any time that dynamics data is modified. This shall provide\na written record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in\nthe field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update.\n\n**V.** **ANNUAL DYNAMICS DATA CERTIFICATION**\n\nISO shall initiate recertification of models for existing transmission equipment\nannually in the first quarter of each calendar year in accordance with MOD-032 and\nthis OP-16J, but with **not more than 13 calendar months between requests. The**\nISO certification initiation communication shall include the existing dynamics data\nmodel and prior supporting dynamic model information. This process requires that\nthe MP, Lead MP, or TO certify or revise the dynamics model and characteristics\nsupplied by ISO with the certification request.\n\nMPs, Lead MPs, or TOs shall respond within 45 calendar days or longer if defined in\nthe request. Either one of the following is an acceptable response:\n\n     - Confirmation that the dynamics model supplied by ISO with the certification\n\nrequest is defined correctly and is consistent with the equipment in the field.\n\n     - Revisions to the dynamics model supplied by ISO with the certification\n\nrequest with such revision are attached to the MP, Lead MP, or TO response.\nISO shall review all submitted data as defined in Section III of this OP-16J.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**VI.** **OP-16 APPENDIX J REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History: (This document created with content from ISO MOD-032 Compliance Bulletin)**\n\n**Rev.**\n\n**Date** **Reason**\n**No.**\n\nRev 0 11/06/15 Initial document\n\nRev 1 08/05/16 Globally all footers, added the required corporate document identity;\nUpdate equipment requirements to include BES equipment;\n\nRev 1.1 11/03/17 Periodic review performed requiring no changes;\n\nPeriodic review performed;\n\nRev 2 11/01/19 Globally, added language clarifying and specifying when data certification\n\nis required;\n\nPeriodic review performed;\nGlobally, added language for references and current applicable device\ndefinitions.\n\nRev 3 10/12/21 Added language to clarify that user models for dynamics equipment\n\ncommissioned after the date this version of the OP is approved shall not\nbe used, and that only standard models per NERC guidelines shall be\nallowed.\n\nRev 3.1 05/05/22 Corrected date in Section I.b.\n\nBiennial review performed by procedure owner requiring no intent\nchanges;\n\nRev 3.2 05/01/24 Minor formatting changes;\n\nUpdated NERC Glossary of Terms hyperlink;\nMade administrative changes required to publish a Minor Revision.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n|Rev.

This process\nrequires that the MP or TO certify that all transmission facilities described in ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission System Data (OP-16) and its\nappendices are accurately represented in the ISO NX Application. The certification will\nbe issued in January of each year unless otherwise communicated to the MP’s NX-9\nadministrators and compliance contacts identified in the ISO Customer and Asset\nManagement System (CAMS).\n\nAccurate and complete data is critical to the creation of the database models used in\nreal-time reliability operations, market operations, operations planning and to the\ncomputer applications that operate on those models.\n\nThis certification process shall serve to ensure that the NX-9 data on file at ISO meets\nthe requirements of OP-16 and its appendices.\n\n**II.** **GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nISO shall initiate the NX-9 certification process by sending a request for selfcertification to the MP or TO NX-9 administrators and compliance contacts identified in\nISO CAMS that includes the date by which the MP or TO shall respond.\n\nThe MP or TO shall ensure that the NX-9 data contained in the NX Application is\naccurate, complete and reflects the actual physical characteristics, ratings, and\noperational limits of all New England Transmission System[1] equipment defined in OP16 and its appendices and in service on or before the certification initiation date.\n\nUpon ensuring that no changes to the NX-9 data are necessary to comply with OP-16\nand its appendices, or when all data changes necessary to comply with OP-16 and its\nappendices have been submitted, the MP or TO shall notify the ISO by selecting the\nNotify ISO-NE Data is Complete checkbox on the Annual Certification display of the\nNX Application. Such notification shall be completed by a date specified by ISO that is\nat least thirty (30) calendar days from the certification initiation date. Data corrections\ndiscovered after the MP or TO has notified ISO that their data is complete for\ncertification shall be submitted in accordance with the normal submission schedule\nand shall not be considered part of the current certification.\n\nISO shall review any submitted data. Upon approval of all data submitted for\ncertification compliance, ISO shall provide the Certification of ISO New England\nTransmission Equipment Rating, Characteristic, and Operational Data form\n(Attachment 1) to the MP or TO.\n\nThe MP or TO shall upload the completed and signed Certification of ISO New\nEngland Transmission Equipment Rating, Characteristic, and Operational Data form to\n\n1 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section\n\nI.2.2.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe NX Application on the NX-9 Annual Certification display no later than five (5)\nBusiness Days[2] after receiving the form or by the original certification due date,\nwhichever is later.\n\nIf an MP or TO fails to respond to the ISO request within the timeframes described\nabove, the ISO Power System Model Management Department shall notify the ISO\nReliability & Operations Compliance group no later than ten (10) Business Days after\nthe deadline date by which the MP or TO should have responded.\n\n**III.** **CERTIFICATION OF ISO NEW ENGLAND TRANSMISSION EQUIPMENT**\n**RATING, CHARACTERISTIC, AND OPERATIONAL DATA FORM**\n\nThe Attachment 1 form shall be used to document the certification of ISO New\nEngland Transmission Equipment Rating, Characteristic, and Operational Data.\n\n**IV.** **OP-16 APPENDIX E REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the RTO**\nOperations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations Date.)\n\n**Rev.

The timely\nsubmission of accurate and complete data is critical to the creation of the models\nused in Real-Time reliability operations, market operations, operations planning\nand to the applications that operate on those models.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Transmission Owners (TOs) and Market Participants, i.e.,\nMarket Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants for\nGenerator Assets (collectively MPs) to determine and submit the required data for\nnew, reconductored, and reconfigured facilities for all their transmission\nequipment in accordance with the submission schedules in Sections II and IV of\nthis ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission System Data\n(OP-16).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe requirement for distribution transformers with a high side winding that\nconnects at voltages of 69 kV or greater became effective on 5/4/12. Those that\nare not currently on file with ISO New England (ISO) will continue to be added in\ncollaboration between ISO and the MPs and TOs.\n\nISO will maintain an application housing NX-9 data for all existing transmission\nequipment, as provided by the MPs and TOs on the appropriate NX-9 form (see\nSection V). ISO is also responsible for acquiring the data for that portion of any\ntransmission facility that is beyond the ISO border.\n\nMPs and TOs shall collaborate with ISO in developing or revising rating\nprocedures, establishing ratings for new transmission facilities and modifying\nratings of existing transmission facilities consistent with Planning Procedure\nNo. 7 (PP7). A facility rating shall equal the rating of the most limiting individual\nequipment that comprises the facility, shall reflect relay loadability limits[2] and shall\naccount for auxiliary support equipment such as wave traps and any other\nequipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary. This requirement\ndoes not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4, and it successor\nstandards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay setting to create\na more limiting thermal rating for a facility.\n\nISO will internally implement data that is submitted by the MP or TO after such\ndata has been reviewed and approved in accordance with OP-16 and its\nappendices and ISO has been notified that it is effective. Notification of data\napproval or implementation will be sent via email to ISO staff and external\n\n1 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services\n\nTariff, Section I.2.2.\n\n2 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Procedure, represents the minimum flow at\n\nwhich the relay acts.\n\n\n-----\n\nstakeholders who have requested such notification in the ISO Customer and\nAsset Management System (CAMS).\n\nQuestions regarding NX-9 data requirements or use of the NX-9 application\nshould be directed to the ISO Participant Support & Solutions.\n\nQuestions regarding Dynamic data, Dynamic Demand data or short circuit data\nrequirements covered by OP-16 and its appendices should be directed to ISO\nParticipant Support & Solutions and should reference NERC Reliability Standard\nMOD-032 Data for Power System Modeling and Analysis (MOD-032) and the\nISO-NE Compliance Bulletin – MOD-032 and ISO New England’s Model Data\nRequirements and Reporting Procedures.\n\n**II.** **NX-9 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE**\n\nMPs and TOs shall submit equipment data for new facilities, planned\nmodifications, planned re-evaluation of existing facilities, correction of detected\ndata errors, unplanned equipment changes, temporary ratings and impedance\nchanges, and re-submission of rejected NX-9s, consistent with the schedules\ndefined in this section. In-Service Date shall mean the date upon which the MP or\nTO reasonably expects the equipment will be ready to be energized or carry\npower.\n\nNew facilities:\n\nFor the purposes of OP-16 and its appendices, new facilities shall include new\nsubstations, new lines, new transformers, transformer replacements and\nadditions of equipment to existing substations.\n\nMPs and TOs shall submit required advanced notice NX-9 data to ISO for new\nfacilities, including planned transformer replacements, at the earliest of at least\none hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the new facility’s\nexpected In-Service Date or in accordance with the dates below.\n\n      - By March 15th for inclusion in the May EMS model release.\n\n      - By July 15th for inclusion in the September EMS model release.\n\n      - By November 15th for inclusion in the February EMS model release.\n\nThis advanced notice data can be based on preliminary, planned or MP/TO\nspecification data and shall be the most accurate data available at the time of\nsubmission.\n\nNX-9 data for transformer replacements due to failure shall be submitted by\nMPs and TOs no later than five (5) Business Days[3] after determining the\nreplacement equipment or one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to\nthe expected In-Service Date of the replacement, whichever is later. This\nadvanced notice data can be based on preliminary, planned or MP/TO\nspecification data and shall be the most accurate data available at the time of\nsubmission.

Planned temporary\nadjustments shall be reported during the outage application process.\n\nTemporary changes expected to be in place forty-five (45) calendar days or\nlonger require an NX-9 submission to be made by the MP or TO in accordance\nwith normal submission schedules. Temporary changes that are expected to\nbe in place less than forty-five (45) calendar days do not require an NX-9\nsubmission.\n\nRe-submission of rejected NX-9s:\n\nNX-9 forms submitted by MPs or TOs that are rejected by the ISO NX-9\nAdministrator will be returned to the MP or TO for correction. For equipment\nwith a scheduled In-Service Date within fifteen (15) Business Days,\ncorrections shall be submitted no later than five (5) Business Days after ISO\nnotification to the MP or TO. For equipment with a scheduled In-Service Date\nlater than fifteen (15) Business Days, corrections shall be submitted no later\nthan ten (10) Business Days after ISO notification to the MP or TO.\n\nWidespread outage and major system restoration:\n\nISO recognizes that during times of widespread outage and major system\nrestoration, it may not be possible to adhere to the above timelines in all\nsituations.

Introduction\n\nThis Appendix I to ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical\nRequirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related\nDemands, and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14I) establishes\noperating requirements for Continuous Storage Facilities (CSFs) as well as reporting\nrequirements under which CSF Operators shall submit data to ISO New England\n(ISO). The submittal of such data supports the reliable and efficient integration of\nenergy storage into the ISO Balancing Authority Area (BAA). The requirements of\nthis OP-14I apply to all Resources registered as a CSF that are or will be:\n\n(i) dispatched by ISO or\n\n(ii) represented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS).\n\nThis OP-14I also includes requirements to submit data that will be integrated into the\nISO EMS in order to facilitate proper System Operator system awareness.\n\nThis OP-14I establishes data reporting and operating requirements specific to CSFs.\nThe CSF Operator shall also comply with any other requirements that apply to CSFs\nunder other ISO Operating Documents\n\n## 2. Definitions\n\n**NOTE**\n\nDefined terms used but not defined in this OP-14I shall have the meanings\nascribed to them in the ISO New England Transmission, Markets, and Services\nTariff or the Glossary of Terms Used in North American Electric Reliability\nCorporation Inc. (NERC) Reliability Standards.\n\nThe following definitions are used for the purposes of this OP-14I:\n\n**_Available Energy is the maximum MWh that a CSF could generate within a_**\nspecified amount of time based on its current equipment status and state of charge.\n\n**_Available Storage is the maximum MWh that a CSF could consume within a_**\nspecified amount of time based on its current equipment status and state of charge.\n\n**_CSF Operator is the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP), or its designee, who_**\noperates a CSF or reports the CSF data to ISO as required in this OP-14I.\n\n**_Facility Max Reactive Lagging Capability is the maximum reactive capability in the_**\nlagging direction (i.e., VAr management that increases local voltage levels) that the\nCSF can supply at the Point of Interconnection given the existing voltage, in a\ncontinuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.\n\n**_Facility Max Reactive Leading Capability is the maximum reactive capability in the_**\nleading direction (i.e., VAr management that decreases local voltage levels) that the\nCSF can absorb at the Point of Interconnection given the existing voltage, in a\ncontinuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\n## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements\n\n**3.1 CSF Data**\n\nUnless ISO agrees to other modeling and data arrangements, CSF data (whether\nstatic or telemetered) that a CSF Operator submits in accordance with this OP-14I\nshall be consistent with the definition of a CSF.\n\n**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**\n\nA CSF shall be designed and operated (including the performance of re-closings\nand restarts) by the CSF Operator in accordance with ISO Operating Documents,\nwhich apply to all Resources within the ISO’s BAA.\n\nIf the CSF main breaker is opened (i.e., the Resource is manually or automatically\ndisconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission System), the CSF\nOperator shall receive permission from ISO and the relevant LCC prior to reclosing\n(i.e., reconnecting to the New England Transmission System). In other words, an\nautomatic restart of the CSF is not permitted following a fault to the Distribution\nSystem or Transmission System that is severe enough to disconnect the CSF\n(e.g., a low voltage ride-through event that is not “ridden-through”) or following any\nCSF-wide out-of-service event.\n\n**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**\n\nDue to the very fast ramping capabilities of CSFs, there is potential for the\ntransmission equipment to which they are interconnected to become significantly\nloaded or unloaded, which may lead to operational and reliability concerns. As\noperational experience is gained, ISO shall evaluate and has the right to implement\nramp rate limitations on a CSF-specific basis, or to all CSFs in New England as\nwarranted. Where ramp rate limitations are applied, the specific CSF limits shall\nbe provided to the Lead MP.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\n## 4. Static Plant Data Requirements\n\nThe static plant data requirements in this section relate to the physical layout of the\nCSF as well as data relevant to the design and operation of the CSF. The CSF\nOperator shall provide this data and shall keep the data up-to-date by completing and\nsubmitting the “CSF Static Data Information Form.” The “CSF Static Data\nInformation Form” is an editable Excel workbook file that shall be requested from,\nand returned as a completed Excel workbook file to, the ISO at\nRenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com. A sample “CSF Static Data Information Form”\nis included as Attachment B to this OP-14I. Instructions are included on the form for\ncompleting and submitting the required data. Attachment A to this OP-14I serves as\nan aid to determining the inverter grouping. Consistent with Schedules 22 and 23 of\nSection II of the Tariff and OP-14, the CSF Operator shall verify that the static plant\ndata for each CSF is kept current. The CSF Operator shall communicate any\nmaterial changes to the data to ISO as soon as practicable.\n\nStatic data:\n\n1. Storage module type(s) and number(s)\n\n2. Maximum storage nameplate capacity (in MWh to two decimal places)\n\n3. Inverter type(s)\n\n4. Maximum inverter nameplate capacity (in MW to two decimal places)\n\n5. Inverter-by-inverter breakdown of relative storage MWh nameplate capacity\n\n6. Descriptions of any permitting or administrative restrictions for the CSF or\n\nany portion of the CSF, such as requirements to reduce or to cease power\nproduction during certain hours or during certain events or weather\nconditions.\n\n## 5. Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer\n\nThis section establishes the Real-Time operational data requirements for CSF\nOperators. In accordance with Table 6.1 of this OP-14I, and as detailed in Section V\n(Internal New England Metering And Telemetering For Dispatch, Market, And\nReliability Purposes) of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 - Metering\nand Telemetering Criteria (OP-18), data required under this Section shall be\nelectronically and automatically transmitted by the CSF Operator to ISO. In addition,\nif any recommended data is provided by the CSF Operator, it shall also conform to\nthe requirements of OP-18. Reliable integration of CSFs into the Real-Time Energy\nMarkets is highly dependent on the availability of Real-Time power production,\nstatus, and capability data. As such, the data provided shall be highly accurate and\nreliable.\n\n**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**\n\nCSF Operators shall provide the Real-Time data collection points listed in Table 6.1\nof this OP-14I that are identified as “Required.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\nAvailable Energy and Available Storage shall be calculated using a 15 minute, 1\nhour, and 4-hour time horizon. These values should reflect the maximum energy\ngeneration and consumption capability, respectively, that could occur during these\ntime horizons, subject to the current state of charge and taking into consideration any\npower restrictions due to equipment, Interconnection Agreement limits, and energy\ncapabilities from any other on-site generation equipment (e.g. PV panels, wind\nturbines, etc.) See Attachment C for example calculations.\n\n**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points**\n\nCSF Operators are requested to provide the Real-Time data collection points list in\nTable 6.1 of this OP-14I that are identified as “Recommended.”\n\nIf the CSF includes any solar PV and/or wind generation (i.e. the solar or wind\ngeneration is not a separately registered Resource for Real-Time Markets), static\nand meteorological data from OP-14 Appendix H and/or OP-14 Appendix F\nrespectively, is requested in order to aid in the development and improvement of\ncentralized solar and wind power forecasts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 6.

These are only meant to illustrate\npotential use cases that may occur and are not meant to capture all situations.\n\n## Example 1:\n\nThe CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-1, with one\ninverter module rated at 5 MW and one storage module rated at 20 MWh, but where the\nlast 1 MWh of energy will not be used for generation to avoid equipment degradation.\nThere are no more restrictive Interconnection Agreement power limitations and no onsite generation from other equipment. Inverter efficiency is 90%, meaning that for each\n1 MWh of consumption, only 0.9 MWh is able to be stored.\n\nThe storage module currently contains 12 MWh of energy.\n\n**Available** **Available**\n**Time Horizon**\n\n**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**\n\n15 Minute 1.25 1.25\n\n1-Hour 5.00 5.00\n\n4-Hour 11.00 8.89\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn 15 minutes and 1 hour, the CSF could generate or consume at full power without\nrunning into the 1 MWh lower limit or completely filling the storage module at 20 MWh.\nTherefore, the 15 minute Available Energy and Available Storage are both 1.25 MWh (5\nMW * 15 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) and the 1 hour Available Energy and Available\nStorage are both 5 MWh (5 MW * 1 hour). These are both examples of being power\nlimited; there is more energy stored (or remaining storage capability) at the facility than\ncould be utilized within these time horizons due to the size of the inverter module.\n\nIn 4 hours, the CSF could not generate or consume at full power without running into\nthe 1 MWh lower limit or completely filling the storage module at 20 MWh. Therefore,\nthe 4 hour Available Energy is 11 MWh (12 MWh currently available – 1 MWh reserved\nto avoid equipment degradation) and the 4 hour Available Storage is 8.89 MWh (20\nMWh total facility capability – 12 MWh currently stored) / 90% efficiency. In this case,\nthe 4 hour values are not power limited but rather, both are storage limited.\n\n## Example 2:\n\nThe CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-3, with two\ninverter modules and three storage modules but where storage modules 1 and 2 can\nonly be used by inverter module 1 and storage module 3 can only be used by inverter\nmodule 2. Equipment capabilities and current storage levels are summarized in the\n\n|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|\n|---|---|---|\n|15 Minute|1.25|1.25|\n|1-Hour|5.00|5.00|\n|4-Hour|11.00|8.89|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\ntable below.

Inverter module 2 could also generate at full\npower without running out of storage (9 MW * 0.25 hours for 2.25 MWh), however,\ndoing so would violate the Interconnection Agreement limitation of 10 MW maximum\npower. Because there is enough energy to supply the inverters for 15 minutes, this\nbecomes power limited. At most, the facility could generate at 10 MW for the entire 15\nminutes for a 15 minute Available Energy of 2.5 MWh (10 MW * 0.25 hours). There is\nalso enough capability to store more energy such that the facility could generate at the\nfull 10 MW allowed for the entire 15 minutes for a 15 Minute Available Storage of 2.5\nMWh.\n\nIn 1 hour, the facility is able to generate at the Interconnection Agreement limit without\nrunning out of energy, however it cannot consume at the full Interconnection Agreement\nlimit without running out of storage capability. 10 MWh could be generated and 9.89\nMWh could be consumed within 1 hour.\n\n|Inverter Group|Inverter Rating (MW)|Inverter Efficiency (%)|Storage Module|Storage Rating (MWh)|Current State of Charge (MWh)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Inverter module 1|6|90%|Storage module 1|7|4|\n||||Storage module 2|5|1|\n|Inverter module 2|9|95%|Storage module 3|12|10|\n\n|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|\n|---|---|---|\n|15 Minute|2.50|2.50|\n|1- Hour|10.00|9.89|\n|4- Hour|15.00|9.89|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\nIn 4 hours, the facility is not able to generate or consume at full output without running\nout of energy in all the storage modules or run out of storage capability. All 15 MWh of\nenergy could be used for generation within that time and the 9 MWh of storage\ncapability could be filled by consuming 9.89 MWh (7.78 in inverter module 1 and 2.11 in\ninverter module 2)\n\n## Example 3:\n\nThe CSF in this example is configured the same as shown in Figure A-1, with one\ninverter module rated at 5 MW and one storage module rated at 10 MWh, but\nadditionally with 3 MW nameplate of Solar PV-capability connected to the same inverter\nmodule as the storage. There are no more restrictive Interconnection Agreement power\nlimitations and the inverter efficiency is 92%\n\nThe CSF Operator determines that the Solar PV output over the next 15 minutes, 1\nhour, and 4 hour time horizons is expected to be 0.5, 1.2, and 4.6 MWh respectively\nbased on their solar PV forecast. The storage module currently contains 2 MWh.\n\n**Available** **Available**\n**Time Horizon**\n\n**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**\n\n15 Minute 1.25 1.25\n\n1-Hour 3.20 5.00\n\n4-Hour 6.60 8.70\n\nExplanation:\nIn the next 15 minutes, 0.5 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site\nPV. If put directly into storage (assuming 100% efficiency since the energy will not flow\nthrough the inverter), there would be 2.5 MWh available for generation. Given the 5 MW\ninverter rating, only 1.25 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time. During that\nsame time, if necessary the PV energy could be foregone to maximize the amount\nconsumed from the Interconnection, which, at full power, would be 1.25 MWh of energy.\n\nIn the next 1 hour, 1.2 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In\naddition to the already 2 MWh in storage, this would result in 3.2 MWh of energy\navailable for generation. During that time, the facility could alternatively consume at full\npower without filling up the storage for a 1 hour Available Storage of 5 MWh (5 MW * 1\nhour).\n\nIn the next 4 hour, 4.6 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In\naddition to the already 2 MWh in storage, this would result in 6.6 MWh of energy\navailable for generation. During that time, the facility could alternatively consume at full\npower and fill up the storage at 10 MWh for a 4 hour Available Storage of 8.70 MWh (10\nMWh storage capability – 2 MWh currently stored) / 92% inverter efficiency.\n\n|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|\n|---|---|---|\n|15 Minute|1.25|1.25|\n|1-Hour|3.20|5.00|\n|4-Hour|6.60|8.70|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\n## Example 4:\n\nThe CSF in this example is configured the same as Example 3 (5 MW inverter with 10\nMWh of storage and 3 MW PV) above with the following difference – the solar PV\ngeneration is participating as a separate market Resource and wants to operate the\nCSF such that the storage can only be charged from the co-located generation and no\nenergy can be consumed from the Interconnection. There are no more restrictive\nInterconnection Agreement power limitations and the inverter efficiency is 92%\n\nThe CSF Operator determines that the Solar PV output over the next 15 minutes, 1\nhour, and 4 hour is expected to be 0.5, 1.2, and 4.6 MWh respectively based on their\nsolar PV forecast. The storage module currently contains 7 MWh.\n\n**Available** **Available**\n**Time Horizon**\n\n**Energy (MWh)** **Storage (MWh)**\n\n15 Minute 0.75 0.50\n\n1- Hour 3.80 1.20\n\n4- Hour 7.00 3.00\n\nExplanation:\nBecause the solar PV is now a separate market Resource, its expected generation\nshould not factor into the CSFs’ energy available for generation except to the point that\nit might violate a combined equipment rating or Interconnection Agreement limit; it will\nhowever impact the amount of energy available for the CSF to consume since it only\ndesired to do so from the solar PV.\n\nIn the next 15 minutes, even though there are 7 MWh available for generation, given the\n5 MW inverter rating, only 1.25 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time.\nBecause the PV is expected to generate 0.5 MW during that time, the CSF cannot\ngenerate more than 0.75 MWh without exceeding the inverter rating. During that same\ntime, since only 0.5 MWh of energy will be produced by the PV, that is all that would be\navailable to be put into storage without consuming from the Interconnection.\n\nIn the next 1 hour, even though there are 7 MWh available for generation, given the 5\nMW inverter rating, only 5 MWh of energy could be supplied during that time. Given that\nthe PV is expected to produce 1.2 MWh during that time, only 3.8 MWh could be\ngenerated from the CSF without exceeding the inverter rating. Based on the expected\namount of PV generation available, the facility could alternatively consume 1.2 MWh.\n\nIn the next 4 hour, 4.6 MWh of energy is expected to be generated by the on-site PV. In\naddition to the already 7 MWh in storage, this would result in 11.6 MWh of energy\nflowing through the inverter, which does not exceed its rating. Therefore, all 7 MWh of\nthe stored energy could be used for generation. During that time, the CSF could\nalternatively store some of the PV generation. Because there are 4.6 MWh of PV\nenergy available but only 3 MW of storage capability remaining, the 4 hour Available\n\n|Time Horizon|Available Energy (MWh)|Available Storage (MWh)|\n|---|---|---|\n|15 Minute|0.75|0.50|\n|1- Hour|3.80|1.20|\n|4- Hour|7.00|3.00|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix I\n\nStorage would be 3 MWh. Inverter efficiency wouldn’t apply since the PV energy would\nbe going directly into the battery rather than from the Interconnection.\n\n\n-----\n\n"},

Introduction\n\nThis Appendix H describes Solar Plant operating requirements and the data reporting\nrequirements that Solar Plant Operators shall submit to ISO New England (ISO).\nThe submittal of such data supports the operation of a centralized regional power\nforecasting system and therefore, the reliable and efficient integration of solar power\ninto the ISO New England Balancing Authority Area (BAA). The requirements stated\nin this Appendix H apply to all Solar Plants, not operating as part of a Continuous\nStorage Facility (CSF), that will be or are dispatched by ISO and/or represented in\nthe ISO Energy Management System (EMS). Included also are requirements for\ndata that will be integrated into the ISO EMS in order to facilitate operator system\nawareness.\n\nNote that this Appendix H discusses Solar Plant data reporting and operating\nrequirements. To the extent that there are other operating, transmission service and\nmarket requirements applicable to Solar Plants, the Solar Plant Operator must refer\nto and comply with the applicable ISO New England Operating Documents.\n\nThe following examples were written primarily for solar Generator Assets that\nproduce energy using photovoltaic (PV) panels and inverters. If the solar Generator\nAsset uses alternative technologies for converting solar insolation to electrical energy\ndelivered to the Point of Interconnection (POI), data requirements may be modified at\nthe discretion of ISO.\n\n## 2. Definitions\n\nThe following are the definitions for terms used in this Appendix H:\n\n**_Curtailment or Curtailed – Solar Plant Operator action (whether manual,_**\nscheduled, or automatic), resulting from an ISO Dispatch Instruction, that limits the\namount of power produced by the Solar Plant to below the maximum amount of\npower that could be produced by the normally operating available equipment given\nthe current weather conditions at the Solar Plant.\n\n**_Met Gathering Station – a permanent purpose-built and/or sited station dedicated to_**\nthe collection of Meteorological Data.\n\n**_Meteorological Data – the real-time data (e.g., Global Horizontal Insolation, Direct_**\nNormal Insolation, wind speeds and directions) collected at a specific Solar Plant’s\nlocation.\n\n**_Plant Max Reactive Lagging Capability – the maximum reactive capability in the_**\nlagging direction (i.e., VAr management that increases local voltage levels) that the\nSolar Plant can supply at the interconnection point given the existing voltage, in a\ncontinuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.\n\n**_Plant Max Reactive Leading Capability – the maximum reactive capability in the_**\nleading direction (i.e., VAr management that decreases local voltage levels) that the\nSolar Plant can supply at the interconnection point given the existing voltage, in a\ncontinuous manner within one minute and maintain for at least one hour.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n**_Plant Wind Directions – the instantaneous wind direction measured by wind_**\nmeasuring equipment (e.g., wind vane).\n\n**_Plant Wind Speeds – the instantaneous wind speeds measured by wind measuring_**\nequipment (e.g. anemometry).\n\n**_Real-Time High Operating Limit – is defined in the ISO New England Inc._**\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section I - General Terms and Conditions\n(Section I).\n\n**_Solar High Limit (SHL) – is defined in the ISO New England Inc. Transmission,_**\nMarkets, and Services Tariff Section I-General Terms and Conditions (Section I)\nSee Section 5.1.2 of this Appendix H and Attachment B hereto for more details\nregarding SHL.\n\n**_Solar Plant – for the purpose of this Appendix H, a Solar Plant is a collection of one_**\nor more solar-collecting/electricity-generating equipment and the additional\nequipment required to interconnect these collectors/converters into the electrical\npower system, consistent with the definition of a Generator Asset in Section I.\n\n**_Solar Plant Future Availability (SPFA) – is defined in the ISO New England Inc._**\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section I - General Terms and Conditions\n(Section I).\n\n**_Solar Plant Operator – for the purposes of this Appendix H, is the Lead Market_**\nParticipant (Lead MP), or its designee, who operates a Solar Plant and/or reports the\ndata to ISO as required in this Appendix H, as applicable.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements\n\n**3.1 Solar Plant Data**\n\nUnless other modeling and data arrangements are agreed to by ISO, Solar Plant\ndata (whether static or telemetered) that is submitted by a Solar Plant Operator in\naccordance with this Appendix H shall be consistent with the definition of Solar\nPlant.\n\n**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**\n\nA Solar Plant shall be designed and operated (including the performance of reclosings and re-starts) by the Solar Plant Operator in accordance with ISO New\nEngland Operating Documents, which apply to all resources within the ISO-NE\nBAA.\n\nIf the Solar Plant main breaker is opened (i.e., the plant is manually or\nautomatically disconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission\nSystem) the Solar Plant Operator must receive permission from ISO and the\nrespective LCC prior to reclosing (i.e., reconnect to the New England Transmission\nSystem). An automatic restart of the Solar Plant is not permitted following a fault\nto the Distribution System or Transmission System that is severe enough to\ndisconnect the Solar Plant [e.g., a Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) event that is\n**not “ridden through”] or following any Solar Plant-wide out-of-service event.**\n\n**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**\n\nDue to the very fast ramping capabilities of Solar Plants, there is potential for the\nequipment with which they are interconnected, to become significantly loaded or\nunloaded. This condition may lead to operational and reliability concerns, therefore\nramp rate limits have been determined as described below. As operational\nexperience is gained, ISO shall reevaluate these limits on either a Solar Plant-bySolar Plant basis, or as applied to all Solar Plants in New England, as warranted.\nWhere alternative ramp rates are determined to be acceptable on a Solar Plantspecific basis (e.g., for the provision of ancillary and/or essential reliability\nservices), those plant-specific limits shall be provided to the Lead MP by ISO.\n\n      - For Solar Plants totaling 200 MW or less in nameplate, under all conditions\n\nexcept for emergencies and decreasing solar conditions, a default\nmaximum ramp rate of 20 MW/min averaged over five minutes is not to be\nexceeded unless otherwise requested by ISO.\n\n      - For Solar Plants totaling greater than 200 MW in nameplate, under all\n\nconditions except for emergencies and decreasing solar conditions, a\ndefault maximum ramp rate of 10% of nameplate per minute (in MW/min)\naveraged over 5 (five) minutes is not to be exceeded unless otherwise\nrequested by ISO; see example below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n|Plant nameplate 110 MW.

Static Plant Data Requirements\n\nThe static plant data requirements that describe the physical layout of the Solar Plant\nand any associated meteorological equipment as well as data relevant to the design\nand operation of the Solar Plant are listed below. This data must be maintained and\nsubmitted by the Solar Plant Operator to ISO using the Solar Plant-Static Data\nInformation Form. The Solar Plant-Static Data Information Form is an editable Excel\nworkbook file and must be requested from ISO, completed, and returned as an Excel\n[workbook file to the ISO at RenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com. A sample Solar](mailto:RenewableResourceInt@iso-ne.com?subject=Solar%20Plant%20Static%20Data%20Form%20Request)\nPlant-Static Data Information Form is available to in Attachment A of this Appendix H.\nInstructions are included, on the form, on how to complete and submit the required\ninformation. Consistent with ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and\nServices Tariff Section II - Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) Schedules 22\nand 23, and OP-14, the Solar Plant Operator shall verify that the static plant data for\neach Solar Plant is kept current and changes are communicated to ISO if any data\npoint changes in a material fashion.\n\nStatic plant data requirements:\n\n1. Solar Plant:\n\n1. Latitude, Longitude, and elevation above sea level (in meters to one decimal\n\nplace) of polygon corners determining spatial location of the solar project\nusing WGS84 DD-MM-SS.SS using GPS WAAS, or comparable,\nmethodology\n\n2.

For model training purposes, the ISO or its designee may require that any\n\navailable historical information regarding plant power output, plant\nmeteorological conditions, and conditions that may have caused power\noutput to be below theoretical maximum power output given the\nexperienced insolation, which are required by the solar power forecaster, be\nprovided.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n## 5. Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer\n\nThis section presents the real-time operational and meteorological data requirements\nfor Solar Plant Operators. In accordance with Table 6.1 to this Appendix H, data\nrequired under this Section must be electronically and automatically transmitted by\nthe Solar Plant Operator to ISO as detailed in OP-18 section V - Internal New\nEngland Metering And Telemetering For Dispatch, Market, And Reliability Purposes.\nIn addition, if any recommended (i.e. not required) data is provided by the Solar Plant\nOperator, it must also follow the same OP-18 requirements. Solar power forecasting\naccuracy is highly dependent on the availability of the real-time meteorological,\npower production, and status data for tuning the forecaster models. As such, this\nrequired information must be provided with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.\n\n**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**\n\n_5.1.1 Meteorological Data_\n\nAmbient air temperature, ambient air pressure, ambient air relative humidity, solar\nirradiance, wind speed, and wind direction must be measured, at a minimum, at one\nlocation within the Solar Plant (preferably as near to the capacity-weighted centroid\nof the Solar Plant as possible) whose height above ground may be in the range of 2\nm to 10 m and the measurement height above must be stated to within 10 cm.\n\nSolar irradiance, wind speed and wind direction measuring equipment (e.g.\npyranometry and anemometry) should be mounted in, on, or near the Solar Plant\nwith reasonable attempt to minimize the effects of obstruction. Wind direction should\nbe calibrated for True North equal to 0 degrees and reported between 0 degrees and\n359.9 degrees\n\n_5.1.2 Solar High Limit_\n\nThe Solar High Limit of a Solar Plant should be calculated as follows:\n\nWhen a Solar Plant is not being Curtailed, its Solar High Limit shall be calculated\nequal to the net generation.\n\nWhen a Solar Plant is being Curtailed, its Solar High Limit shall be calculated\nequal to the Solar Plant’s possible power production given current sun/weather\nconditions and equipment status if the curtailment were not in place. This will be\ngreater than the net generation.\n\n(See Attachment B to this Appendix H for additional guidance and examples).\n\n_5.1.3 Real-Time High Operating Limit_\n\nA Solar Plant Real-Time High Operating Limit (RTHOL) is the maximum power\nproduction (MW) the Solar Plant would be capable of in real-time, given ideal sun\nconditions and no Curtailment. (See Attachment B to this Appendix H for additional\nguidance and examples).\n\nRTHOL should not be impacted by less than ideal sun conditions (e.g. cloudiness),\nor time of day (e.g. before the sun has risen, or after the sun has set), except if the\nSolar Plant is disconnected based upon a day/night cycle. If the Solar Plant is\ndisconnected solely because of day/night cycle, the RTHOL should be set to zero but\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\nan outage is not required pursuant to OP-5.\n\nWhen snow, ice, or other materials are fully or partially covering the PV panels, the\nRTHOL should be reduced to reflect the generation capability given those conditions.\nIf panels are unable to produce energy given the conditions, it should be reported\nequivalent to a full or partial outage as applicable.\n\n_5.1.4 Solar Plant Future Availability_\n\nSolar Plant Future Availability is equivalent to the future hour’s expected RTHOL and\nshould therefore be calculated using the same methodology as RTHOL but with the\nexpected equipment status for the hour being calculated.\n\nIn contrast to all other Real-Time data which is provided to the ISO via telemetry,\nSolar Plant Future Availability is provided to the ISO using the ISO-NE Wind and\nSolar Integration web services. In the future, once a solar power forecast can be\ndeveloped, this web service could also be used to gather solar plant power forecasts\nprovided by the ISO-NE solar power forecaster. Information on using the web service\nplatform, including data specification and sample files are available in the following\nZip file: https://www.iso-ne.com/static[assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sam](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)\n[ple_files_AssetID_change.zip](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)\n\n**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points and Practices**\n\nIn order to ensure that data of a high quality will be incorporated into the centralized\nforecasting system, ISO requests that Solar Plant Operators follow the practices for\nmeteorological data collection for each Solar Plant as outlined below:\n\n1. Collect and provide to ISO, Meteorological Data from at least one met station\n\nthat is strategically placed or utilized so that it will be impacted to a minimal\nextent by plant operations.\n\n2. The Met Gathering Station equipment should be located at well‐exposed sites.\n\nIt is recommended that each solar panel in the Solar Plant should be within 5\nkm of a Met Gathering Station.\n\n3. In order to avoid outage of data, it is recommended that additional “backup”\n\ndata collection sites are selected in addition to the required data specified in\nSection 5.2.1.\n\n4. The method(s) of measuring solar irradiance (e.g. Global Horizontal\n\nIrradiance, Direct Normal Irradiance, etc.) should be identified to the ISO\nduring the data collection points setup so they can be utilized properly within\nforecasting systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 6.

Losses between the Solar Plant and the Point of Interconnection (POI)\nare not taken into account in these simplified examples, but should be in the SHL\ncalculation such that the SHL reports the net power injection at the POI rather than the\ngross production.\nThe following Solar Plant is used within all subsequent examples:\n\nA Solar Plant has three strings of solar panels each connected to dedicated inverters as\nfollows:\n\n**String** **Solar Panel** **Solar Panel Capacity** **Inverter Rating** **Inverter**\n\n**#** **Type** **[MW DC]** **[MW AC]** **Efficiency [%]**\n\n1 A 5 3 95\n\n2 B 4 3 95\n\n3 C 3 2 97\n\nEach solar panel type can produce power according the amount of solar irradiance as\nfollows:\n\n|String #|Solar Panel Type|Solar Panel Capacity [MW DC]|Inverter Rating [MW AC]|Inverter Efficiency [%]|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|A|5|3|95|\n|2|B|4|3|95|\n|3|C|3|2|97|\n\n|Solar Panel Type|Solar irradiance [W/m2]|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||0|100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900|1,000|\n|A|0|10%|20%|30%|40%|50%|60%|70%|80%|90%|100%|\n|B|0|9%|18%|27%|36%|45%|54%|63%|72%|81%|90%|\n|C|0|12%|24%|36%|48%|60%|72%|84%|96%|100%|100%|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n## Example 1:\n\nSolar irradiance is measured to be 500 W/m[2] by the pyranometer in the Solar Plant.

With\nthat value determined, it can be used to calculate the DC Potential MW. Applying the\nInverter Efficiency, the AC Potential MW values are calculated. For all three strings, it\ncan be seen that no Inverter Capability is violated. The RTHOL is the maximum output\nthat could be achieved given available equipment. In this case that is 8 MW (limited by\nthe Inverter Capability). The Solar High Limit is 6.0 MW because the Solar Plant is not\nCurtailed and therefore SHL equals net generation. If the Solar Plant were curtailed to 4\nMW based on an ISO Dispatch Instruction, the SHL would be 5.831 MW, based upon\nthe AC Potential MW of each string, adjusted for losses.\n\n|String #|Available|DC Panel Capacity|Power % based on irradiance|DC Potential MW|Inverter Efficiency|AC Potential MW|Inverter Capability MW|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1 2 3|Yes Yes Yes|5 4 3|50% 45% 60%|2.5 1.8 1.8|95% 95% 97%|2.375 1.71 1.746|3 3 2|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix H\n\n## Example 2:\n\nSolar irradiance is measured to be 800 W/m[2] by the pyranometer in the Solar Plant.\nString 3 is unavailable due to maintenance on the inverter.\n\n**Individual String Details**\n\nPower % DC Inverter AC Inverter\n\nString # Available [DC Panel ] based on Potential Efficiency Potential Capability\n\nCapacity\n\nirradiance MW MW MW\n\n1 Yes 5 80% 4 95% 3.8 3\n\n2 Yes 4 72% 2.88 95% 2.736 3\n\n3 No 0* 0*% 0* 0*% 0* 0*\n\nTotal 9 6.88 6.536 6\n\n_*Set to 0 due to being unavailable_\n\n**Solar Plant Totals**\n\nISO Provided Generation Limit 4.5 MW\n\nNet Generation: 4.4 MW\n\nRTHOL: 6.0 MW\n\nSHL: 5.736 MW\n\nExplanation:\n\nWith String 3 unavailable, its capability is excluded from all calculations. Values for\nString 1 and 2 are determined in a similar manner as in Example 1, however, in this\nexample it can be seen that String 1’s AC potential MW capability exceeds the inverter\nrating. The RTHOL would be 6 MW (limited by inverter capability). Because of the 4.5\nMW limit provided by the ISO being below what the Solar Plant would otherwise be\ncapable of producing, the Solar Plant is Curtailed and the SHL is therefore 5.736 MW (3\nMW from String 1 limited by the inverter and 2.736 MW from String 2 limited by the\npanels)\n\n|String #|Available|DC Panel Capacity|Power % based on irradiance|DC Potential MW|Inverter Efficiency|AC Potential MW|Inverter Capability MW|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1 2 3|Yes Yes No|5 4 0*|80% 72% 0*%|4 2.88 0*|95% 95% 0*%|3.8 2.736 0*|3 3 0*|\n\n\n-----\n\n"},

Based on this\nevaluation, NX-9B data forms may be required. When required, the NX-9B\ndata forms shall be provided by the Lead MP for the Generator Assets.\n\n     - NX-9B data forms are not required for GSUs that connect a generator to the\n\ntransmission system via a line(s) that also serves customer load.\n\n     - NX-9B data forms are not required for GSUs associated solely with\n\nSettlement Only Generators.\n\nNX-9B data forms for transformers or individual wind turbine or solar GSUs\nconnected at voltages that are less than 69 kV may be required when ISO\ndetermines that the data is necessary for reliable operation of the New England\nTransmission System. When required by ISO, the TO or MP shall submit the data\nwithin thirty (30) calendar days of ISO’s notification.\n\nA separate NX-9B form shall be provided for each transformer. All data items shall\nbe completed for each winding unless these instructions specifically indicate\notherwise.\n\nA copy of the manufacturer’s nameplate, either by document (.pdf format) or digital\nphotograph (.tif or .jpg formats), shall be included as a file attachment to the NX-9B\nform for new or replaced equipment.\n\nA copy of the manufacturer’s test report document (in .pdf format) shall be included\nas a file attachment to the NX-9B form for all new or replaced equipment and upon\nrevision of existing NX-9B forms for transformers whose low voltage connection is\n69 kV or greater.\n\n1 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n2 New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, Section\n\nI.2.2.\n\n3 Generally, under Section I of Operating Procedure No. 16, data shall be provided by Transmission Owners\n\n(TOs) and Market Participants, i.e. Market Participants who own the equipment or Lead Market Participants\nfor Generator Assets (collectively MPs).\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **GENERAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nThe NX-9B form provides for entry of both ISO and MP/TO data. ISO fields cannot\nbe modified by the MP or TO. The MP or TO is responsible for providing data for\nall non-ISO fields via the NX Application.\n\nThe circuit number shall initially be entered by the MP or TO for new equipment\nand thereafter maintained by ISO.\n\nSelect the terminals that reflect the connection points of the equipment. Terminals\nare created and maintained by ISO. The user should contact the ISO NX-9\n[Administrator (nx9admin@iso-ne.com) if terminal additions or changes are](mailto:nx9admin@iso-ne.com)\nneeded.\n\nTo remove equipment from service, select the Remove Equipment From Service\ncheckbox. Equipment is removed from service either when the equipment is\nretiring from service or if new forms are being submitted as a replacement due to a\nchange in configuration.\n\nAll voltage data item responses are to be in kV unless otherwise indicated in these\ninstructions.\n\nTo assist in completing the NX-9B form, sample manufacturer's nameplate data\nand completed NX-9B forms utilizing that data are attached.\n\nExample 1: Fixed Tap Transformer\n\nExample 2: Generator Step-Up (GSU) Transformer\n\nExample 3a and 3b: Tap Change under Load (TCUL) Three Winding Transformer\n(developed using the same nameplate data)\n\n3a - TCUL Three Winding Model: Transformer with tertiary loaded.\n\nAny 3-winding transformer whose tertiary winding connects to a generator, a\ntransmission bus, a sub-transmission bus, a distribution bus or a\ncapacitor/reactor bank should be modeled consistent with Example 3a. This\nexample assumes the tertiary is connected to a capacitor bank.\n\n3b - TCUL Two Winding Model: Transformer with tertiary not loaded.\n\nAny 3-winding transformer whose tertiary winding is not loaded should be\nmodeled consistent with Example 3b. If the total station service load served\nby one or more tertiary windings is less than 1 MW, then the transformer\nshall be modeled consistent with Example 3b.\n\nIf the total station service load served by one or more tertiary windings is greater\nthan 1 MW, then the MP or TO shall confirm with ISO whether the transformer\nshould be modeled consistent with Example 3a or 3b.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nAll tap position item responses shall indicate tap positions using numbers (1, 2, 3,\n4, etc.) as opposed to letters (a, b, c, d, etc.). See examples 3a and 3b where tap\npositions designated by letter on the nameplate sheet have been designated by\nnumber on the sample NX-9B forms.\n\n**III.** **RATING DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nFacility rating data shall be provided in MVA (rounded down to the nearest whole\nnumber) and determined in accordance with Planning Procedure 7, “Procedures\nfor Determining and Implementing Transmission Facility Ratings in New England”\n(PP7). The definition of Thermal Ratings is described in PP7 Section 2.0\nCollaborative Development of Rating Procedures. Additional information regarding\nthe rating of GSU Transformers and Load Serving Transformers exists in PP7\nAppendix D, Power Transformers, Section 3.0 Application Guide. A facility rating\nshall equal the rating of the most limiting individual equipment, shall reflect relay\nloadability limits[4], and shall account for auxiliary support equipment such as wave\ntraps and any other equipment that Good Utility Practice suggests is necessary.\nThis requirement does not remove the TO’s obligation to adhere to PRC-023-4,\nand it successor standards, nor does it suggest a TO be allowed to change a relay\nsetting to create a more limiting thermal rating for a facility.\n\nThe NX-9B form provides for entry of both summer (April 1 through October 31)\nand winter (November 1 through March 31) thermal ratings as well as ratings for\nspecial conditions or configurations. The ambient temperature (reported in\nFahrenheit) used to establish the normal ratings shall be entered for each rating\nset. If ratings for special conditions or configurations are added to the NX-9B form,\ncomments that describe the associated circumstances for use of the special\nratings are required. The MP or TO is also responsible for providing a statement\nas to the authority of ISO and the Local Control Center (LCC) for use and\ndistribution of these special ratings.\n\n**IV.** **CHARACTERISTIC AND OPERATIONAL DATA INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nComplete the following fields as instructed below:\n\nNameplate kV – Provide the transformer voltage rating for utilized connections as\nlisted on the nameplate document.\n\nImpedance Data – Provide the positive sequence resistance (R) and reactance (X)\ncalculated at the kV of the no load tap position in use for the fixed tap, and the\nNameplate kV on the tap change side, in percent on a 100 MVA base. Do not\nadjust values to nominal system voltage. Impedance on new or revised NX-9B\nforms shall be calculated and provided out to at least the 3[rd] decimal place.\n\n4 The term “relay loadability limits”, as used in this Appendix, represents the minimum flow at which the relay\n\nacts.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor transformers with different fixed normal tap settings at Heavy and Light\nLoad, provide the impedance calculated at the Heavy Load fixed tap setting.\n\nFor transformers whose test report does not provide impedance at each tap,\nprovide the impedance at the closest tap for which impedance is provided\non all new or revised NX-9B forms. Provide a statement in the Equipment\nNotes field of the NX-9B form indicating the tap position at which the\nimpedance is calculated.\n\nImpedance data for three (3) winding transformers being modeled consistent with\nSection I Example 3a should be submitted using a wye configuration. Refer to\ndiagram below.\n\n\nR X\n\n\nkV\n\n2\n\n115\n\n# * 1 = 345/\n *\n3\n\n2 = 115/ *\n\n69\n\n3 = 69/ *\n\n\n345\n\n\n1\n\n|Col1|2|\n|---|---|\n||2|\n|||\n|3||\n\n\nImpedance data for three (3) winding transformers being modeled consistent with\nSection I Example 3b should be submitted in two (2) winding format.\n\nTransformer Type – Enter the type of the transformer based upon the descriptions\nbelow:\n\nGSU – Generator Step-Up transformer.\n\nFIXED – Transformer without a load tap changer (LTC). Tap changes for\nthese transformers typically require the transformer be out of service.\n\nTCUL-Non Auto – Transformer has an LTC but it is disabled.\n\nTCUL-Auto[5] – Transformer has an enabled LTC.\n\nNormal Operating Mode – For a TCUL-Auto type transformer, enter the normal\noperating mode based upon the descriptions below. The normal operating mode\nselected should reflect the operational state that the transformer is expected to be\nin the majority of the time.\n\nIf the operational mode is dependent upon local generation, load level or other\nsystem condition, provide this information in the Equipment Notes field of the\nNX-9B form (example: transformer is operated in automatic mode when generator\nXYZ is offline or when load level is above xx mw). The Normal Operating Mode\nfield shall still reflect the operational state that the transformer is expected to be in\nthe majority of the time.\n\n5 The term TCUL-Auto as used in this appendix, represents a transformer with an enabled LTC that may or may\n\nnot be an autotransformer. An autotransformer has only a single voltage winding which is common to both\nprimary and secondary.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nManual-Local – LTC is operated locally at the substation.\n\nManual-Remote –Tap changes are made using the SCADA system and are\nmanually initiated by an LCC System Operator[6] or a TO control room\noperator remotely.\n\nAuto – Transformer has enabled controls for automatic operation that allow\nthe equipment to respond to a contingency, typically within 2 minutes,\nwithout manual intervention. Tap changes for normal operation occur\nwithout LCC System Operator or TO control room operator intervention.\n\nTap Switching Time Delay – For a TCUL-Auto type transformer with the Normal\nOperating Mode field set to Auto, enter the tap switching time delay in seconds.\n\nVoltage Schedules – Voltage schedule data is required for all TCUL-Auto\ntransformers with Auto and Manual-Remote control types and is optional for\ntransformers with the Normal Operating Mode field set to Manual-Local. Voltage\nschedule data is not accepted for GSU, Fixed and TCUL Non-Auto transformers.\n\n        - The Controlled Winding and Controlling/LTC Side Winding flags shall be\n\nset when entering voltage schedule data.\n\n         - Typically a transformer operates to the same schedule in both on peak[7]\n\nand off peak[8] hours so the prevalent schedule shall be entered as both\non and off peak in the voltage schedule table. If a transformer operates\nto a different schedule during on-peak and off-peak hours, the different\nschedules shall be entered in the voltage schedule table and a brief\nexplanation shall be provided in the Equipment Notes field describing\nhow the voltage schedule is modified in the field.\n\n        - A transformer with the technology to use SCADA to modify the\n\nprogrammed target voltage shall enter the single most prevalent\nscheduled voltage and minimum/maximum voltage range for both on and\noff peak and shall provide all other minimum, scheduled and maximum\nsettings available in either the Equipment Notes field or as a file\nattachment (referenced in the Equipment Notes field).\n\nTCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to Auto\n(voltage schedule data is required):\n\n         - Schedule data entered in the voltage schedule table shall equal the field\n\nprogrammed target voltage and the minimum and maximum voltages\nshall equal the control bandwidth settings from the field.\n\n6 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n7 On-Peak is from 0700-2300 on weekdays that are not NERC holidays.\n8 Off-Peak is from 2300-0700 on weekdays, all weekends and NERC holidays.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nTCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to\nManual-Remote (voltage schedule data is required):\n\n     - The voltage schedule data entered shall equal the most prevalent target\n\nvoltage and range used by the operators.\n\n     - If there is no typical voltage schedule or range used by the operators:\n```\n      o Enter a scheduled voltage that matches the overall area voltage\n\n```\nprofile and/or any nearby regulating devices such as generators,\nSTATCOMs or synchronous condensers.\n```\n      o Enter a generic 100% and 105% of nominal system voltage for the\n\n```\nminimum and maximum voltages.\n\nTCUL-Auto transformer with the Normal Operating Mode field set to\nManual-Local (voltage schedule data is optional):\n\n     - If the optional voltage schedule data is provided, it shall equal the most\n\nprevalent target voltage and range used by the operators.\n\n     - If there is no typical voltage schedule or range used by the operators:\n```\n      o Enter a scheduled voltage that matches the overall area voltage\n\n```\nprofile and/or any nearby regulating devices such as generators,\nstatic synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) or synchronous\ncondensers.\n```\n      o Enter a generic 100% and 105% of nominal system voltage for the\n\n```\nminimum and maximum voltages.\n\nHeavy/Light Load Normal Tap - This is required for all windings with taps. Enter\nzero (0) for windings without taps.\n\nFor the purposes of this document, heavy load shall mean the summer\nmonths of June through August and light load shall mean the remaining\ncalendar months of January through May and September through\nDecember.\n\nFor no load windings with fixed tap positions - Enter the seasonal no load\ntap position (position number) as the normal tap number for each load\nperiod.\n\nFor other windings with fixed tap positions - Enter the fixed tap position\n(position number) as the normal tap number for each load period.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor LTC windings on TCUL-Auto transformers (the Normal Operating Mode\nfield is set to Manual-Local, Manual-Remote or Auto):\n\n       - Enter the typical heavy load tap position as the normal tap number for\n\nboth load periods.\n\n       - If no typical heavy load tap position exists, enter the tap number\n\ncorresponding with the nameplate voltage of that winding as the\nnormal tap number for both load periods.\n\nStep Size (per unit) – Enter the step size for each winding (per unit). This data can\nusually be taken from the manufacturer’s nameplate information and should be\ncalculated as follows.

It will provide a\nwritten record of the change and clearly identify the equipment changes made in\nthe field and/or other reasons that necessitated the update of the NX-9B form. For\nexample: Tap information corrected to match nameplate.\n\nThis data is utilized by ISO in the NX-9B form review and approval process.\n\n**VI.** **EQUIPMENT NOTES**\n\nThe Equipment Notes field is used to provide explanations of data or other\npertinent or operational information. For example: This transformer is operated in\nautomatic mode when generator XYZ is offline or when load level is above xx MW.\n\nFor transformers that are part of a dynamic reactive device control scheme, a brief\ndescription of the control scheme is required to provide clarity regarding the\nmanner in which the transformer is operated.\n\nFields are provided for both ISO and MP/TO notes. An additional private field is\navailable to the MP or TO for internal notes that can be edited and viewed only by\nthe MP or TO owning the record.\n\nEquipment notes are carried forward when an NX-9B form is updated. MPs and\nTOs should review and modify or delete any MP or TO note that is no longer\npertinent. ISO is responsible for maintaining ISO notes.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 1,** **NX-9B** **FIXED TAP TRANSFORMER**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 1** **(CONTINUED),** **NX-9B** **FIXED TAP TRANSFORMER**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 1** **(CONTINUED),** **MANUFACTURER’S NAMEPLATE**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 2,** **NX-9B** **GENERATOR STEP-UP (GSU)** **TRANSFORMER**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 2** **(CONTINUED),** **NX-9B** **GENERATOR STEP-UP (GSU)** **TRANSFORMER**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 2** **(CONTINUED),** **MANUFACTURER’S NAMEPLATE**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 3A,** **NX-9B** **TCUL** **3-WINDING TRANSFORMER WITH TERTIARY LOADED**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 3A** **(CONTINUED),** **NX-9B** **TCUL** **3-WINDING TRANSFORMER WITH TERTIARY LOADED**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 3B,** **NX-9B** **TCUL** **2-WINDING TRANSFORMER WITH TERTIARY NOT LOADED**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 3B** **(CONTINUED),** **NX-9B** **TCUL** **2-WINDING TRANSFORMER WITH TERTIARY NOT LOADED**\n\n\n-----\n\n**EXAMPLE 3A+B** **(CONTINUED),** **MANUFACTURER’S NAMEPLATE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**VII.** **OP-16 APPENDIX B REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the RTO**\nOperations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

All required data\nmust be provided for each defined Generator, as per OP-14, Section II.A.\n\nOnce an initial NX-12 has been provided, any change in Generator data must be\nreported to ISO via “Ask ISO”. The Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) for the\nGenerator shall provide an explanation and/or documentation to support the change\nrequest. The explanation may be in the form of a verbal review with ISO or written\ndocumentation, as stipulated by ISO. ISO shall review the supporting explanations and\ndetermine if the change request will be accepted, denied, or if further modification or\ninformation is needed in order to accept the change request\n\nIn order for an NX-12 form to be approved by ISO, all required data must be provided\nwithout errors and without omissions. It is the responsibility of the Lead MP to correct\nerrors or omissions of NX-12 data form and re-submit the corrected data to ISO. ISO\nwill be the sole judge of when NX-12 data is complete and correct. The effective date\nfor changes to NX-12 data items must be at least seven (7) business days from the\ndate that such determination is made by the ISO that the data is complete and without\nerrors.\n\nWhen requested to select from a list of items, please indicate your selection by entering\nan “x” in the appropriate space on the NX-12 form.\n\n**Revision - Form revision identification and date of revision.**\n\n**Lead Market Participant - The Lead Market Participant of a Generator as defined in**\nSection I.2.2 of the Tariff.\n\n**LP ID# - The Customer ID, as assigned to each entity at the time of Customer**\nRegistration, as defined in ISO New England Manuals and Procedures.\n\n**Local Control Center - The Local Control Center (LCC) with TOP responsibilities for**\nthe transmission system where the Generator is interconnected.\n\n**Generator Name - The name of the Generator must:**\n\n   - Be unique to each Generators\n\n   - Length cannot exceed 30 characters\n\n**Generator ID - The Generator Asset ID, as assigned to each Generator at the time**\nof Asset Registration Procedure, as defined in ISO New England Manuals and\nProcedures.\n\n**Designated Entity - Name of the entity, for the Generator, registered in accordance**\nwith ISO Manual M-RPA that receives, acknowledges, and responds to the ISO\ndispatch instructions and communications.

Each time revised data is\nsubmitted and approved by ISO, the Data Revision Number must be incremented.\nThe revision number should only be incremented from one approved NX-12 to the\nnext approved NX-12. In other words, if changes to an approved NX-12 are\ndesired and a new NX-12 form is submitted for approval, the data revision number\nshould be incremented. If, however, there are errors or missing data on that new\nNX-12 form, another corrected form must be submitted by the Lead MP. This\ncorrected form should have the errors corrected and/or missing data provided, but\nthe Data Revision Number should be the same as on the previously submitted\nform. The Data Revision Number is incremented only from one approved NX-12 to\nthe next approved NX-12.\n\n**Date Prepared - The date on which the NX-12 data is completed and submitted to**\nISO.\n\n**Requested Effective Date - The date that the new NX-12 is to become effective.**\nFor a new Generator, the effective date is to be at least One Hundred Twenty (120)\ndays following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives the NX-12\n(assuming that the NX-12 form and all other required data are complete and\nwithout errors). For an existing Generator, the effective date is to be at least seven\n(7) business days following the day that the designated recipient at ISO receives\nthe data (assuming it is complete and without errors). If there are errors or\nomissions of NX-12 data, subsequent submittals of corrected NX-12 data must\nhave a Requested Effective Date that is at least seven (7) business days from the\ndate that the corrected NX-12 data is received by ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\nSection 2: Operational Basic Information\n\nThis information indicates the Generator Type, Predominate (Primary) Fuel Type,\nSecondary (Alternate) Fuel Type, Startup Fuel Type, Heat Rate, Physical Capabilities\nand Fuel Switch of a Generator.\n\n**Generator Type - Select the type (prime mover) of Generator from the choices**\nlisted in the drop-down menu.\n\n1.

Blackstart Capable\n\nIndicates that a Generator has the physical ability to Blackstart (starting\nwithout outside electrical supply). All Generators with this capability must\nselect this indicator in the NX-12 Generator Technical Data Form. This is\nan indication of physical capability only and does not imply or convey\napproval, acceptance or contractual obligation for supply or compensation\nunder Schedule 16 of the OATT.\n\n2. Electronic Dispatch Capable:\n\nIndicates the Generator has Electronic Dispatch Capability and is able to\nreceive dispatch instructions via an ISO Communications Front End (CFE)\nconnected Remote Terminal Unit (ISO-connected RTU).\n\n3. Do Not Exceed Dispatchable:\n\n\n-----\n\nIndicates the Generator operates under Do Not Exceed Dispatchable\nguidelines as specified in the Tariff.\n\n4. Fast Start Capable:\n\nA Generator with the ability to operate with all of the following\ncharacteristics:\n\na. Minimum Run Time does not exceed one hour;\nb. Minimum Down Time does not exceed one hour;\nc. Time to start does not exceed 30 minutes after receiving a Dispatch\n\nInstruction from ISO;\n\nd. Available for dispatch and manned or has automatic remote dispatch\n\ncapability;\n\ne. Capable of receiving and acknowledging a start-up or shut-down\n\ndispatch instruction electronically.\n\n5. Auto Start Capable\n\nAny Generator that is configured such that the START / STOP /\nEMERGENCY / NORMAL signal delivered to the ISO-connected RTU is\nelectronically transferred to the generation plant control equipment. The\nplant control equipment is then capable of:\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIt is not acceptable for the Generator RTU to directly provide the ACK\nresponse to an ISO START/EMERGENCY signal. The ACK must come from\nthe Generator generation control computer and be passed to the Generator\nRTU, which then passes it back to the ISO CFE.\n\nThis capability requires prior written approval from ISO before being accepted\non NX-12.\n\nThe Auto Start Capable Flag shall be “N” for Intermittent Power Resources and\nContinuous Storage Facilities.\n\na. Sending an electronic acknowledgement signal back to the ISO\nconnected RTU indicating it has acknowledged the\nSTART/EMERGENCY request and\n\nb. Will physically start and operate the Generator autonomously without\n\nany user interaction.\n\nc. It will then follow the specified DDP target automatically and\n\ncontinuously.\n\nThe chain of electronic communication is:\n\nISO CFE  Generator RTU  Asset generation control computer\n\n6. Regulation Capable\n\nThis indicates that a Generator has the appropriate telecommunications,\ncontrol and response capability to increase or decrease its output in\nresponse to an electronic regulating control signal, in accordance with the\nspecifications in the ISO Manuals and Operating Procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\nSection 3: Physical Generator Capabilities\n\n1. Nameplate Capability\n\nThe maximum rated output of the Generator Asset, in MVA, under conditions\nspecified by the manufacturer.  Installed Generator nameplate capability is\ntypically indicated on a nameplate physically attached to the Generator. For a\nGenerator Asset comprised of multiple units, enter the sum of the nameplate\ncapabilities of the individual units. Typical nameplate values are given at 59\ndegrees F, 1 atmosphere pressure and 60% relative humidity.\n\n2. Rated Power Factor\n\nValues submitted on the most recent approved and implemented\nInterconnection Agreement with ISO. (e.g., a Generator rated at 100 MVA and\nrequired by Interconnection Agreement to have a 0.95 lagging power factor and\na 0.95 leading power factor would have lagging 95 MW -31 MVAr, leading 95\nMW -31 MVAr)\n\n3. Minimum Manual Load Point\n\nThe minimum generation amount, in net MW, specified by the manufacturer, for\na Generator to remain stable for an extended period of time. For a Generator\nAsset comprised of multiple units, this is the lowest value required for any\nindividual unit that is capable of operating without the support of another unit\n(e.g., combustion turbine on a combined cycle plant). In the event that multiple\nunits must be run (e.g., steam cannot be dumped or bypassed on a combined\ncycle plant), this is the lowest output for the combined units. This is a reliability\ndeclaration, not a Market declaration and will not be considered or used for\nMarket operations.\n\n4. Minimum Permitting-Restricted Load Point\n\nThe minimum generation amount, in net MW, required for a Generator to meet\nany regulatory requirements (e.g., emissions, minimum flow restrictions, etc.).\nFor a Generator Asset comprised of multiple units, this is the lowest value\nrequired for the Generator Asset. This is a reliability declaration, not a Market\ndeclaration and will not be considered or used for Market operations. For\nGenerators with no permitting restrictions, this value would be equal to the\nMinimum Manual Load Point. For ambient limited Generators, provide the value\nat 59 degrees F, 1 atmosphere and 60% relative humidity.\n\n5. Network Resource Capability\n\nEnter the net Network Resource Capability for each season. The Network\nResource Capability can typically be found in the governing Interconnection\nAgreement and is fully defined in the Section II.48 of the OATT as the maximum\nnet megawatt electrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of\nInterconnection.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Winter Network Resource Capability - The maximum net megawatt**\nelectrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection at\nan ambient temperature at or above 0 degrees F.\n\n**Summer Network Resource Capability - The maximum net megawatt**\nelectrical output of the Generating Facility at the Point of Interconnection at\nan ambient temperature at or above 50 degrees F.\n\nIf the Network Resource Capability is only specified in the governing\nInterconnection Agreement as a total for a Generating Facility that includes\nmultiple Generator Assets, the sum of the Network Resource Capabilities of the\nindividual Assets may not exceed the total Network Resource Capability\nspecified in the Agreement.\n\n\n-----\n\nSection 4: Additional Information Required for Gas Turbine and Combined Cycle\nAssets Only\n\nFor Claimed Capability Audit (CCA) purposes, ISO must adjust or normalize the output\nof a gas turbine and combined-cycle Assets to the standard 90° (summer) and 20°\n(winter) temperatures upon which Claimed Capability for such a unit is based. Lead\nMPs submitting an NX-12 for such a unit must include a table reflecting the full range\n(100° - 0°F, in one degree increments) of temperature versus MW output for that unit.\nThe MW output values in this table must be reported to three decimal places.\n\nThe table of temperature versus output MW values in Section 4 should be\nrepresentative of the expected relationship between ambient (or inlet) temperature and\nMW output of the Generator. The table values are expected to reflect the\nmanufacturer-supplied relationship between temperature and output for the Generator.\nThe MW output values at 90°F and 20°F do not necessarily have to match the current\nrespective summer and winter SCC values.

The owner of equipment designed and\nimplemented to perform automatic load restoration shall notify ISO New England\n(ISO) of its operating time upon request from ISO during the annual UFLS survey.\n\n**Automatic Switching of Capacitor Banks, Lines and Reactors**\n\nAt this time, the ISO UFLS program does not require Transmission Owners (TOs) to\nprovide automatic switching of their existing capacitor banks, transmission lines, or\nreactors.\n\n**UFLS Aggregated Reporting**\n\nISO has identified three (3) UFLS islands for applying the New England UFLS\nprogram:\n\n1. Maine portion of the Maine-Maritimes\n\n2. Connecticut\n\n3. All of New England\n\nISO only permits aggregation of UFLS programs for actual load shedding for entities\nwith service territories that are within the same identified UFLS island and that are\nelectrically close. If further information on aggregating is required, contact ISO\nParticipant Support.\n\nISO shall approve any aggregated reporting.\n\n**Compensatory Load Shedding**\n\nIn accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No.14 – Technical\nRequirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related\nDemands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), non-nuclear\nGenerators that trip above the generator under-frequency curve included in the\neffective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC shall, as described in\nthat NERC standard, either modify their protection settings to no longer trip above the\ncurve or use compensatory load shedding of an amount equal to the Generator’s\nSummer Seasonal Claimed Capability (SCC) if the protection settings cannot be\nmodified. Documentation regarding underfrequency trip setting constraints shall be\nprovided to ISO as described in the effective version of PRC-006-NPCC and UFLS\ncollection schedule in Table 1.\n\nGenerators using compensatory load shedding should provide SCC and expected\nstation service load megawatt (MW) amounts to TOs or Market Participants.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompensatory load shedding must be in the same under-frequency island as the\ngeneration and must be electrically close. ISO shall approve of compensatory load\nshedding applications. For further discussion of compensatory load shedding refer to\nPRC-006-NPCC.\n\nAs described in NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC, nuclear generators that\ntrip above the generator underfrequency curve are not required to provide\ncompensatory load shedding.\n\n**UFLS Program Parameters, Tolerances and Exceedances/Deviations**\n\nThe New England UFLS program uses the UFLS parameters and generator\nunderfrequency trip settings listed in the effective version of NERC Reliability\nStandard PRC-006-NPCC.\n\nEach Distribution Provider (DP) or TO that must arm its load to trip on underfrequency\nin order to meet its requirements, as specified, and that, by doing so, exceeds the\ntolerances and/or deviates from the number of stages and frequency set points of the\nUFLS program as specified in the tables included in the effective version of NERC\nReliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC depending on its total peak net Load shall:\n\n   - Inform ISO of the need to exceed the stated tolerances or deviate from the\nnumber of stages, and frequency setpoints as shown in Attachment C, Table 1\nincluded in the effective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC.\n\n   - Provide ISO with a technical study that demonstrates that the DPs or TOs\nspecific deviations from the requirements of Attachment C, Table 1 included in\nthe effective version of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC will not\nhave a significant adverse impact on the BES.\n\n   - Inform ISO of the need to exceed the stated tolerances of the effective version\nof NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Attachment C, Table 2 or Table\n3, and in the case of Attachment C, Table 2 only, the need to deviate from\nproviding two stages of UFLS, if applicable.\n\n   - Provide ISO with an analysis demonstrating that no alternative load shedding\nsolution is available that would allow the DP or TO to comply with the effective\nversion of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC, Attachment C Table 2\nor Table 3.\n\nIn regard to the requirements on UFLS program tolerances or stages, if an UFLS\nentity determines that exceedances or deviations exist, then that entity shall initiate\nthe process of providing a corrective action plan for addressing the exceedances or\ndeviations to the UFLS program tolerances or stages.\n\nFor entities whose system peak loads vary between the tables, or load is reduced to\nbelow the UFLS program amounts shown in the tables contained in the effective\nversion of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC (e.g., 25 MW), then load shall\nvary accordingly for two consecutive years prior to changing to another table or\ndiscontinuing a UFLS program.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Inhibit Settings**\n\nISO requires voltage inhibit settings to be at or below 0.7 per unit. Current and time\ninhibit settings are unique and generally used to coordinate distributed generation. If\nISO coordination of settings is required, then this is done through individual\ndiscussions with entities using current and time inhibit settings.\n\n**Table - 1 - UFLS Information Collection Schedule**\n\n**UFLS Information** **ISO Initiates Annual**\n\n**Survey/ Format**\n\nTransmission or distribution UFLS relays, including July, format consistent with\nthose used for compensatory load shedding, the previous surveys.

ISO New\nEngland (ISO) and/or the Local Control Centers (LCCs) use this load reducing capability\nto maintain system reliability during generating capacity deficiencies, energy\ndeficiencies, and other emergency operating conditions described in ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4) and ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7).\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\n**II.** **COMPLIANCE**\n\nMPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities shall comply with the\nstandards established by this OP. MPs/TOs not in compliance shall immediately take\nactions to achieve compliance.\n\nA MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities may achieve compliance\nby arranging with another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities to\nprovide on its behalf, voltage reduction and/or load shedding capability. The voltage\nreduction and/or load shedding capability provided by such arrangements shall be in a\nsimilar electrical location to the MP/TO for which service is provided. Such\narrangements shall yield equivalent support to transmission system load and voltage as\nwould be obtained if the MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities had\ninstalled voltage reduction and load shedding capability on its own system.\n\nArrangements may also be made for one (1) MP/TO with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities to provide voltage reduction and/or load shedding\ncapability for another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities during\na portion of the day or week. For example, an MP/TO with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities not able to reduce voltage or shed load during the\nentire period of time that such capability is required may arrange for another MP/TO\nwith control over transmission/distribution facilities, subject to the requirements of the\nprevious paragraph, to provide such capability on its behalf during the deficient periods.\nA MP/TO providing voltage reduction and/or load shedding capability for another MP/TO\nwith control over transmission/ distribution facilities shall not count the capability\ndedicated to another MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities toward\nmeeting its own requirements.\n\nThe details of arrangements between MPs/TOs with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities for voltage reduction and/or load shedding services to\nmeet the standards of this OP must be submitted to and approved by ISO.\n\nA MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities that is not a Participating\nTransmission Owner, as that term is defined in the Transmission Operating Agreement,\nshall establish all necessary arrangements with an appropriate LCC to facilitate the\nimplementation of ISO directives with respect to voltage reduction or load shedding.\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\n**III.** **REQUIREMENTS**\n\n**A. Voltage Reduction**\n\n1. Voltage reduction shall take place on the distribution system wherever possible.\n\nIt is recognized that in certain areas, voltage reduction is implemented on the\nsubtransmission system. Voltage reduction shall not be implemented on the\ntransmission system operating at 69 kV and above.\n\n2. Ideally, voltage reduction capability shall be installed so that all loads are subject\n\nto a five (5) percent voltage reduction. However, it is recognized that it may not\nbe practical to subject some loads to voltage reduction (e.g., loads served from\nthe transmission system, voltage sensitive loads, etc.). It may be desirable to\nsubject some loads to a voltage reduction of less than five (5) percent. However,\neach MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities shall have the\ncapability to reduce system load demand at the time a voltage reduction is\ninitiated by at least one and one-half (1.5) percent through implementation of a\nvoltage reduction.\n\n3. It is intended that voltage reductions be fully implemented within ten (10) minutes\n\nfrom the time ordered. However, it is recognized that it may not be practical for\nsome MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities to meet this\nrequirement. In those circumstances, voltage reduction that can be implemented\nin thirty (30) minutes is permissible.\n\n4. Each MP/TO responsible for providing voltage reduction capabilities within ten\n\n(10) minutes shall make this capability available for use seven days a week\nduring the period between 0800 to 2300 hours.\n\n5. Each MP/TO responsible for providing voltage reduction capabilities that require\n\nlonger than ten (10) minutes shall be able to implement this voltage reduction on\nall non-holiday weekdays during the period between 0800 to 2300 hours.\nHolidays are those listed in Appendix A to this OP.\n\n6. Upon application to and approval by ISO, the requirement for voltage reduction\n\ncapability may be satisfied by an equivalent amount of interruptible loads. Such\nloads shall be interruptible within ten (10) minutes of issuance of ISO’s voltage\nreduction operating instruction. Loads designated for this purpose shall be\ndedicated to OP-4, shall be under dispatch authority of ISO and/or the\nappropriate LCC, and do not qualify as Demand Response Resources or Asset\nRelated Demands under the provisions of ISO New England Operating\nProcedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response\nResources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation\nResources (OP-14).\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\n**B. Load Shedding**\n\n1. In accordance with the provisions of the NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006\nNPCC – Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding, each Distribution Provider\n(DP)/Transmission Owner (TO) with 100 MW or more of peak net Load shall\nimplement an Underfrequency Load Shedding (UFLS) program with attributes\nthat include load shedding stages, frequency setpoints, block sizing, and total\noperating times as detailed in Attachment C, Table 1 of PRC-006-NPCC.\n\nAll DPs/TOs with 50 MW or more and less than 100 MW of peak net Load shall\nimplement a UFLS program as prescribed in Attachment C, Table 2 of PRC-006NPCC.\n\nAll DPs/TOs with 25 MW or more and less than 50 MW of peak net Load shall\nimplement a UFLS program as prescribed in Attachment C, Table 3 of PRC-006NPCC.\n\nDPs/TOs with less than 25 MW of peak net load connected to their facilities are\nexempt from providing UFLS.\n\nMPs/TOs may collectively implement and provide, by mutual agreement with one\nor more DPs/TOs within the same island and acting as a single DP/TO, an\naggregated automatic UFLS program that sheds their coincident peak\naggregated net Load, based on the frequency thresholds, total nominal operating\ntime and amounts specified in PRC-006-NPCC, Attachment C, Tables 1 through\n3.\n\nLoad shed automatically by underfrequency relays shall not be automatically\nrestored.\n\nUnder frequency threshold relays shall be set to a nominal total operating time of\n300 ms, from the time when frequency passes through the set point to the time of\ncircuit breaker contact opening (including any communications time delay), with a\nminimum relay operating time to be no less than 100 ms when the rate of\nfrequency decay is 0.2 Hz per second. This is consistent with the requirements\nof NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC Attachment C.\n\n2. Each MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities must be capable\n\nof manually shedding at least fifty (50) percent of load in ten (10) minutes or less.\nThe first half of the load shed manually should not include load which is part of\nany automatic load shedding plan unless following manual load shedding, the\nrequirements of NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC - Automatic\nUnderfrequency Load Shedding, Attachment C can still be met.\n\n3. Manual load shedding should not interrupt transmission paths. MPs/TOs with\n\ncontrol over transmission/distribution facilities that include such interruptions in\nload shedding plans must demonstrate from system simulations that\ntransmission interruptions will not degrade interconnected system reliability.\n\n4. Manual load shedding plans may incorporate the use of electronic notification\n\nsystems, outside of normal business hours, to notify MPs/TOs with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities personnel that manual load shedding has been\nrequested. MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities whose\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\nplans include the use of such a system must coordinate those plans with the\nappropriate LCC. In addition, MPs/TOs with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities whose plans include use of an electronic\nnotification system will consider receipt of an Abnormal Conditions Alert, under\nMaster/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert\n(M/LCC 2), as notification that their substations are to be staffed for possible\nimplementation of manual load shedding during the period that the Alert is in\neffect.\n\nThis provision for the use of an electronic notification system is subject to review\nby the Reliability Committee relative to the overall manual load shedding\ncapability of the New England Reliability Coordinator Area / Balancing Authority\nArea (RCA/BAA) and the extent to which such systems are being used to provide\ncoverage outside of normal business hours. The compliance surveys performed\nin accordance with Section IV of this OP will serve as the basis for such\nReliability Committee reviews.\n\n5. The plan should include the capability of shedding load proportionately over the\n\nwhole system; however, it is recognized that this may not be practical in some\nareas.\n\nGeneration connected to sub-transmission or distribution systems will have an\never-increasing impact on load shedding plans. If a Generator is interrupted as\npart of a load shedding plan by an MP/TO with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities, an equivalent amount of additional load must\nbe included in the load shedding plans.\n\n6. Each MP/TO with control over transmission/distribution facilities must be capable\n\nof implementing automatic and manual load shedding twenty-four (24) hours a\nday.\n\n7. Once manual load shedding has been implemented, the appropriate LCC will\n\ninform the MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities of the\nestimated length of time that the load is expected to be interrupted. Depending\non the time estimate, MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution\nfacilities may choose to initiate feeder rotations. During the rotation process,\nload must be interrupted before an equivalent load can be restored.\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\n**IV.** **TESTING**\n\n**A. Voltage Reduction**\n\nAt the discretion of ISO, a system-wide voltage reduction test will be conducted. An\nactual voltage reduction will be implemented. MPs/TOs with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities will record the load reduction attained within ten\n(10) minutes and/or thirty (30) minutes in the test. If such records are not possible,\nLCC load relief data may be used. Each MP/TO with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities will complete a questionnaire that will record load\nrelief attained and identify operational, or customer problems that were encountered\nand should be resolved. The data will be used by ISO to update load relief\nestimates contained in OP-4, and to help verify each MP/TO with control over\ntransmission/distribution facilities voltage reduction capability.\nVoltage reduction tests will be conducted in accordance with the following\nparameters:\n\n1. A date will be established for the test.\n\n2. MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities will be given a\n\nwritten notice four (4) weeks in advance of the test date.\n\n3. If system operating conditions force cancellation of the test, a new date will be\n\nset in accordance with the above parameters.\n\n**B. Load Shedding**\n\nEvery second month, ISO will conduct a simulated manual load shed test to train the\nISO, LCC, and MPs/TOs with control over transmission/distribution facilities\npersonnel in all aspects of manual load shedding procedures. These tests will be\nconducted in accordance with OP-7 to the maximum extent possible. Tests will\ndeviate from actual load shed operations in the following manner.\n\n1. All verbal load-shedding operating instructions issued will be preceded and\n\nconcluded with the statement, “This is a test. Do not shed load”.\n\n2. Operators will not open breakers or disconnect actual load, but instead, will\n\nobserve or estimate the amount of load that would have been shed on the circuit\nhad it been an actual load shedding operation. These tests may be used to help\nverify an MP/TO with control over any transmission/distribution facility capability\nto reduce system load by as much as fifty (50) percent.\n\n3. Operators will report the amount of load that would have been shed and the\n\nlength of time to do it to their next highest dispatching authority. ISO will issue\nreports on each simulated manual load shedding test. The report will specify the\namount of load relief attained and the time interval to attain the load shed during\nthe test.\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\n\n**OP-13 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the RTO**\nOperations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

INTRODUCTION\n\nReactive capability (NX-12D) data defines and represents the physical characteristics and ratings of a\nreactive device, including (but not limited to): Generators (as defined in ISO New England Operating\nProcedure No. 14 – Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset\nRelated Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14) ), Dispatchable Asset\nRelated Demands (DARDs), or other dynamic reactive devices (e.g., synchronous condensers or flexible\nalternating current transmission systems (FACTS) devices) and is required by ISO New England (ISO)\nand the Local Control Centers (LCCs) in order to develop accurate system models and to support the\nreliable operation of the New England Transmission System. Each Market Participant (MP) is required to\nprovide this data through the ISO NX submittal software as described in this Appendix B to OP-14 (OP14B).\n\nNX-12D data is required for each device that is located in the New England Reliability Coordinator Area\n(RCA) and is either\n\ni) part of a Generator, including generating facilities consisting of multiple generating units, where that\n\nGenerator has a total real power capability of at least 1 MW,\n\nii) part of a DARD that is contained within an Electric Storage Facility (ESF DARD),\niii) A shunt-connected dynamic reactive power device (e.g.., Static VAR Compensator (SVC), or\n\nSynchronous Condenser), or\n\niv) is another type of dynamic reactive device for which ISO or the LCC requires and specifically\n\nrequests reactive capability data.\n\nThe MP may submit one set of representative reactive capability data, including the number of devices\ninstalled, for electricity producing or consuming devices that:\n\ni) use an inverter (e.g., photovoltaic, wind, etc.),\nii) are associated with the same Resource, DARD or other piece of dynamic reactive equipment; and,\niii) have the same Point of Interconnection.\n\nNX-12D data may be required by ISO and the LCC for other dynamic reactive devices that support the\nreliable operation of the New England Transmission System. Because the capabilities of these devices\nmay not match the descriptions in this OP-14B, ISO, the LCC, and the MP will work together to\ndetermine how to accurately represent the reactive capability of these devices through the NX submittal\nsoftware.\n\nThe manufacturer nameplate lagging and leading reactive power (MVAr) output capability is based on\nthe design parameters of the equipment. This capability represents the theoretical maximum reactive\ncapability of a specific reactive device.\n\nThe manufacturer nameplate operating lagging and leading MVAr output capability may be limited during\nnormal operation by any one of several devices or considerations other than the manufacturer nameplate\ncapability curve. Examples of limiting devices include, but are not limited to, excitation limiters, electrical\nprotection relaying, and thermal protection relaying. Examples of limiting considerations include, but are\n**not limited to, internal station voltage requirements, auxiliary equipment constraints, resource**\ninterconnection generator step-up transformer (GSU) overheating, fuel or prime mover limitations, and\ncontractual arrangements. When any such limitations are present, the equipment cannot operate at the\nmanufacturer nameplate reactive capability. This restricted capability represents the normal reactive\noperating capability and, accordingly, it shall be included in the NX-12D data.\n\nThe MP shall report any change in the reactive capability of a device in Real-Time to ISO and the\nappropriate LCC control room. If it is determined that the change will last longer than six (6) months,\nthen the MP shall update NX-12D data in the NX submittal software.\n\nThe MP shall verify all NX-12D data is accurate upon submittal and at least annually. ISO shall initiate,\nand the MP shall respond to, the annual NX-12D data verification, which shall be performed through the\nNX submittal software.\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\n\nAppendix B\n\n### II. DATA SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe MP shall submit NX-12D data through ISO NX submittal software under the following conditions:\n\n1. Prior to ISO designating a Resource or ESF DARD as being ready to follow dispatch;\n2. Prior to a dynamic reactive device being placed in service;\n3. No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date when a determination is made by ISO or the MP\nthat the data contained in the NX submittal software is inaccurate; or,\n4. No later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of determination that a temporary modification to\na Reactive Resource with NX-12D data, that affects that Reactive Resource’s reactive capability, will be\nin effect for longer than six (6) months.\n\nSynchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual machines require\na separate NX-12D form for each machine and a separate NX-12D form for the composite Reactive\nResource.\nNon-Synchronous Generator Assets or ESF DARDs that are comprised of multiple individual pieces of\ndynamic reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for each equipment type at the asset.\nReactive devices with multiple types of reactive equipment require a separate NX-12D form for the\ncomposite asset. For example, a wind plant that is comprised of twenty-five (25) turbines from one (1)\nmanufacturer and twenty-five (25) turbines from another manufacturer would require two (2) separate NX12D forms (one for each unique machine type) and an additional NX-12D form that captures the entire\nplant composite reactive power capability.\n\n### III. DATA DETERMINATION FOR SUBMITTAL\n\n**A. Prerequisites for filling out the NX-12D form**\nThe following are required in order for the MP to provide accurate data on the NX-12D form:\n\n1. Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This curve is also referred to as the P/Q or\n\nMW/MVAr curve. This curve is provided by the manufacturer of the reactive equipment and is a graphic\nillustration of the reactive capability of a machine as a function of real power output or consumption. It\nrepresents the physical limitations of that machine based upon design parameters. This curve shall be\nuploaded to the application using the File Attachments tab. NOTE: If this curve is not available because\nthe manufacturer is out of business or other similar circumstance, the curve shall be created by the MP\nusing the best possible data for the resource capability.\n\n2. Reactive Capability curve showing any limitations to the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This\n\ncurve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve. These limitations can include, but are not limited to:\nunder-/over-excitation, prime mover (maximum MW limit), and procedural limitations. This may be\nprovided by the manufacturer or may need to be created by the MP using all of the known limitations\noverlaid onto the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This curve shall be uploaded to the\napplication using the File Attachments tab.\n\n3. Voltage schedule or automatic voltage regulator exemption as provided by the Transmission\n\nOperator.\n\n### B. Theoretical and Tested Values\n\n[The Theoretical and Tested Values section of the NX-12D data form is where MPs provide reactive ]\n\ncapability data that has been derived from the Nameplate Reactive Capability and Normal Operating\ncurves in order to discretely model those curves in ISO systems. In order to determine these discrete data\npoints, MW values are determined based upon manufacturer maximum MW value, minimum MW value,\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\nand certain other MW values that may be present on a given reactive capability curve. The MVAr values\nthat correspond to these MW values are then determined either graphically or mathematically from the\nreactive capability curves.\n\n   - These capability values represent gross reactive (MVAr) and real (MW) power as measured at the\n\nequipment terminal prior to station service load.\n\n   - Lagging (over-excited) capability is defined as the Resource providing reactive power to the electrical\n\nsystem and is denoted as a positive value.\n\n   - Leading (under-excited) capability is defined as the Resource absorbing reactive power from the\n\nelectrical system and is denoted as a negative value.\n\nFigure 1 – Data Required for Theoretical and Tested Values\n\n### 1. Synchronous Machines That Produce Real Power and Pump DARDs \n\nNOTE: Synchronous machines are considered any rotating machine that is electrically coupled to the\n\nelectrical system through an electrical generator.\n\nThe “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to “0” unless otherwise directed by ISO.\n\n### a. Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Determination\nThe Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design\nspecifications of the equipment.  Figure 2 illustrates a typical Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a\nsample synchronous machine at various hydrogen pressures when not encumbered by any protective or\nlimiting concerns. The sample synchronous machine is designed to operate at thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen\npressure. For equipment nameplate capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs for\nnine (9) points along the capability curve (see, Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\nFigure 2\n\nLeading Break\nLagging Break Point\nPoint Load MW\nLoad MW\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSome manufacturers provide a curve with lagging (over-excited) and leading (under-excited) axes\nreversed (i.e. leading will be on the positive y-axis and lagging will be on the negative y-axis).\n\n### (1) Nameplate Real Power Data Values\n\n**i. General Instructions**\n\n[(a) ] These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power\n\ncapability for Nameplate Reactive Capability or Normal Operating Curves.\n\n(b) These MW values will be N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach that\n\nMW value on the Normal Operating curve.\n\n   - An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty (20) MVA but limited by the prime mover\n\ncapability of ten (10) MW. In this case, the machine cannot produce enough real power in order to\nreach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Points on the Normal Operating\ncurve.\n\n(c) If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output,\n\nthe curve that most closely approximates forty (40) degrees Celsius (40[o]C) shall be used to determine\nreactive capability.\n\n|Lagging B Load MV|r-Excited)|\n|---|---|\n|reak Point Ar|(Ove|\n\n\nLeading Break\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n(d) If there are multiple voltage-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves, the curve for 1.0 per unit\n\n(p.u.) shall be used.\n\n(e) Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MW values shall be N/A (if the Resource is part of a\n\nstorage facility, the reactive capability while consuming will be reported on a separate NX-12D form).\n\n**ii. Nameplate Real Power Data Point Determination**\n\n(a) Determine the Minimum Manual Load Point MW (see, Points 1 and 6 on Figure 2). This value:\n\n  - is the lowest MW output at which the machine can produce both real and reactive power;\n\n  - is a manufacturer-provided value;\n\n  - shall be the lower of the summer and winter values if there are separate values; and\n\n  - if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points.\n\n(b) Determine the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point MW (see, Point 5 on Figure 2). This\nvalue is the:\n\n  - maximum real power capability of the machine at unity power factor, not taking into account any\n\nlimitations such as prime mover capability;\n\n  - point where the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve crosses the zero (0) MVAr point; and\n\n  - if modified, changes the values of the Intermediate and Three Quarter Load Points.\n\n(c) Determine the Intermediate Load Point MW (see, Points 2 and 7 on Figure 2). This is a calculated\n\nvalue that is halfway between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity Generating Unit Power\nFactor Load Point and is determined by the equation:\n\n𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊\n\n= 0.5 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n\n  - This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the\n\nmachine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation.\n\n  - This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual\n\nLoad Point are changed.\n\n(d) Determine the Three Quarter Load Point MW (see, Points 3 and 8 on Figure 2). This is a calculated\nvalue that is seventy-five percent (75%) between the Minimum Manual Load Point and the Unity\nGenerating Unit Power Factor Load Point and is determined by the equation:\n\n𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑀𝑊\n\n= 0.75 ∗(𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡−𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) + 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑑 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n\n  - This point is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the\n\nmachine cannot reach the MW value in normal operation.\n\n  - This point will change if the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point or the Minimum Manual\n\nLoad Point are changed.\n\n(e) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MW (See Point 4 Figure 2). This value:\n\n  - is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.\n\n  - Is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where\n\nthere is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the field winding limit and stator design\nlimit;\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n  - may be a different value than the Leading Break Point Load MW value;\n\n  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and\n\n  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot\n\nreach the MW value in normal operation.\n\n(f) Determine Leading Break Point Load MW (See Point 9 Figure 2). This value:\n\n  - is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve\n\nwhere there is an intersection between the curve sections reflecting the stator design limit and the end\nregion heating limit;\n\n  - may be a different value than the Lagging Break Point Load MW value;\n\n  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve data if there is no break point in the curve; and\n\n  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited to a point that the machine cannot\n\nreach the MW value in normal operation.\n\nThe Transitional Load Point MW values are determined by overlaying any limitations (e.g. over-/underexcitation limiters or turbine max power limits) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve. This\ncombined curve is referred to as the Normal Operating curve for the machine. Figure 3 illustrates a typical\nNormal Operating curve for a sample synchronous generating unit at various hydrogen pressures when\nthat machine is limited by protective relaying or limiting concerns. The sample generating unit is designed\nto operate at a thirty (30) PSIA hydrogen pressure level.\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\nFigure 3\n\nLagging Transitional\n\nLeading Transitional\n\nLoad Point MW\n\nLoad Point MW\n\n**NOTE**\n\nCurve limitations may be labeled using abbreviations such as OEL (over-excitation limit), UEL\n(under-excitation limit), MEL (minimum or maximum excitation limit), etc.\n\n(g) Determine Lagging Transitional Load Point MW (see, Point 13 Figure 3). This value:\n\n  - is determined by examining the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where\n\nthe most limiting limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - may be a different value than the Leading Transitional Load Point MW value;\n\n  - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve if there is no limitation or that limitation does not\n\nintersect with the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; and\n\n  - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW limited such that the machine cannot\n\nreach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.\n\n(h) Determine Leading Transitional Load Point MW (See Point 18 Figure 3). This value:\n\n  - is determined by examining the Normal Operating Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve\n\nwhere the most limiting limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;\n\n\nLagging Transitional\n\nLeading Transitional\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n   - may be a different value than the Lagging Transitional Load Point MW value;\n\n   - is N/A for Nameplate and Normal Operating curve if there is no limitation or that limitation does not\n\nintersect with the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve; and\n\n   - is N/A for Normal Operating curve data if the machine is MW-limited, such that the machine cannot\n\nreach the MW value where the limit curve intersects the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.\n\n**(2) Nameplate Reactive Power Data Point Determination**\n\n**i. General Instructions**\n\n[(a) These values do][ not][ take into account any limitations (under-/over-excitation, prime mover (max P ]\n\nlimit), procedural, etc.) on the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.\n\n(b) The reactive power values may differ between Nameplate Reactive Capability curve values and\n\nNormal Operating Curve values depending upon any machine limitations. The absolute value of the\nNormal Operating curve MVAr values cannot be greater than the absolute value of the Nameplate\nReactive Capability curve MVAr values.\n\n(c) These reactive power values will be N/A on the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach\n\nthe MW value on the Normal Operating curve. An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty\n(20) MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of ten (10) MW. In this case, the machine cannot\nproduce enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load\nPoints.\n\n(d) If there are multiple temperature-based Nameplate Reactive Capability curves for the machine output,\n\nthe curve that most closely approximates 40 degrees Celsius (40[o]C) shall be used to determine reactive\ncapability.\n\n(e) If there are multiple gas pressure curves, the curve that represents the machine’s normal operating\n\npressure shall be used.\n\n(f) All values shall be in MW or MVAr. If the curve provided by the manufacturer is not in MW or MVAr,\n\nthese values shall be converted by the MP.\n\n(g) Motoring Capability and Full Pumping Capability MVAr values shall be N/A.\n\n### ii. Nameplate Lagging Reactive Power Value Determination\n\n(a) Determine the Lagging Minimum Manual Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over\nexcited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual\nLoad Point MW value.\n\n(b) Determine the Lagging Intermediate Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)\n\nportion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load Point MW\nvalue.\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n(c) Determine the Lagging Three Quarter Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)\n\nportion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load Point\nMW value.\n\n(d) Determine Lagging Break Point Load MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of\n\nthe Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Break Point Load MW value.\nThis point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.\n\n(e) Determine Lagging Transitional Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the lagging (over-excited)\n\nportion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Lagging Transitional Load\nPoint MW value. This point is N/A if there is no limitation or that limitation does not intersect with the\nnameplate curve.\n\n### iii. Nameplate Leading Reactive Power Value Determination\n\n(a) Determine the Leading Minimum Manual Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under\nexcited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Minimum Manual\nLoad Point MW value.\n\n(b) Determine the Leading Intermediate Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under\nexcited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Intermediate Load\nPoint MW value.\n\n(c) Determine the Leading Three Quarter Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under\nexcited) portion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Three Quarter Load\nPoint MW value.\n\n(d) Determine Leading Break Point Load MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under-excited) portion\n\nof the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Break Point Load MW value.\nThis point is N/A if there is no break point in the curve.\n\n(e) Determine Leading Transitional Load Point MVAr. This is the point on the leading (under-excited)\n\nportion of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve that corresponds to the Leading Transitional Load\nPoint MW value. This point is N/A if there is no limitation or that limitation does not intersect with the\nnameplate curve.\n\n### b. Normal Operating Capability Data Point Determination (1) Normal Operating Capability Real Power Values\n(a) These MW values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power capability\n\nfor either the Nameplate or Normal Operating curves.\n\n(b) These MW values will be N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach that\nMW value on the Normal Operating curve.\n\n  - An example of this is a machine that is capable of 20 MVA but limited by the prime mover capability of\n\n10 MW. In this case, the machine cannot produce enough real power in order to reach the Three\nQuarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Points on the Normal Operating curve.\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n**(2) Normal Operating Capability Reactive Power Data Determination**\n\nThese values shall reflect any limitations (under-/over-excitation, prime mover (max P limit), procedural,\netc.) that restrict the machine MVAr or MW capability to less than the Nameplate Reactive Capability\ncurve.\n\n(a) The reactive power values may differ between the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve values and\n\nNormal Operating curve values depending upon any machine limitations. The absolute value of the\nNormal Operating curve MVAr values cannot be greater than the absolute value of the Nameplate\nReactive Capability curve MVAr values.\n\n(b) These reactive power values will be N/A on the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach\n\nthe MW value on the Normal Operating curve.

Non-Synchronous Machines That Produce Real Power and non-Pump DARDs\n\nNOTE: Non-Synchronous machines are any machine that is electrically coupled to the electrical system\nthrough power electronics. These machines include, but are not limited to, inverter-based resources.\n\nThe “Identical Unit Count” field shall be equal to the number of identical power producing pieces of equipment\nat the asset.

Nameplate Reactive Capability Data Point Determination\nThe Nameplate Reactive Capability curve is provided by the manufacturer based upon design specifications of\nthe equipment.  Figure 3 illustrates a Nameplate Reactive Capability curve for a sample non-synchronous\nmachine. A specific reactive capability curve for a non-synchronous machine may look different than the\nexample curve in Figure 3; however, the concepts for determining the MW and MVAr points are similar for all\ntypes of curves. For equipment reactive power capability, the requested data consists of MW and MVAr pairs\nfor eleven points along the capability curve (see, Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\n\nAppendix B\n\nP (MW)\n\n**NOTE**\n\n|Figure 3 – Non-Synchronous Resource Nameplate Reactive Capability curve|y curve|\n|---|---|\n|Lagging Apparent Power Transitional Load at Break Point Load MW Point MW Load Lagging 5 3 MVAr 7 Break Point Point 1 9 (Calculated) Load Unity (MVAr) 2 Q 10 6 Point Leading P (MW) 8 4 Load Leading Apparent Leading Break Break Power at Break Lagging Break Point Point Load MW MVAr Point Load MW Load MW|Transitional Load Point MW|\n|Leading Break Point Load MVAr||\n\n\n5 3\n\n7\n\n1 9\n\n2\n\n10\n\n6\n\nP (MW) 8 4\n\n\nSome manufacturers provide a curve with lagging (over-excited) and leading (under-excited) axes\nreversed (i.e. leading will be on the positive y-axis and lagging will be on the negative y-axis).\n\n### (1) Nameplate Real Power Values i. General Instructions\n\n\n(a) These values are the same regardless of whether the MP is determining reactive power capability for\n\nNameplate or Normal Operating curves.\n\n\n(b) These MW values are N/A on data for the Normal Operating curve if the machine cannot reach the MW\n\nvalue on the Normal Operating curve. An example of this is a machine that is capable of twenty (20) MVA but\nlimited by the prime mover (e.g., solar panel, battery) capability of ten (10) MW. In this case, the machine\ncannot produce enough MW in order to reach the Three Quarter or Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load\nPoints.\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n(c) If there are multiple temperature-based curves for the machine output, the curve that most closely\napproximates forty (40) degrees Celsius (40[o]C) shall be used to determine reactive capability.\n\n(d) If there are multiple voltage curves, the curve for one (1.0) per unit (p.u.) shall be used.\n\n(e) All values shall be in MW or MVAr.

This value:\n\n  - is determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - is the MW value that corresponds to the point on the lagging (over-excited) portion of the curve where\n\nthere is an intersection between the curve sections such as sections based on maximum voltage versus\nmaximum current limits;\n\n  - is equal to N/A if there is no break-point in the curve;\n\n  - may be a different value than the Leading Break Point Load MW value; and\n\n  - is the point with the highest MW value if there are multiple break-points on the curve.\n\n(c) Determine Leading Break Point Load MW (See Point 4 Figure 3). This value is:\n\n  - determined by examining the Manufacturer Nameplate Reactive Capability curve;\n\n  - the MW value that corresponds to the point on the leading (under-excited) portion of the curve where there\n\nis an intersection between the curve sections such as sections based on maximum voltage versus\nmaximum current limit;\n\n  - equal to N/A if there is no break-point in the curve. This point may be a different value than the Lagging\n\nBreak Point Load MW value; and\n\n  - the point with the greatest MW value if there are multiple break-points on the curve.\n\n(d) Determine the Unity Generating Unit Power Factor Load Point MW (See Figure 3). This value is either:\n\n(i) the point where the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve crosses the zero reactive power point (unity\n\npower factor); or,\n\n(ii) If the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve does not cross zero:\n\n\n-----\n\ngy g\n\nAppendix B\n\n  - the greater of the apparent power of the machine at the Lagging Break Point Load MW and the Leading\n\nBreak Point Load MW; and\n\n  - may not fall within the MW range of the Nameplate Reactive Capability curve.

Introduction\n\nA Market Participant (MP) may offer a resource to ISO as a potential Designated\nBlackstart Resource (DBR). If the ISO and the System Restoration Working Group\n(SRWG) determine that a resource could provide a potential benefit to the New\nEngland System Restoration Plan, then the MP may need to perform a blackstart\ncapability conversion study and a blackstart conversion for that resource to become\na DBR.\n\nIf a blackstart capability conversion study is required, then ISO and the proposed\nBlackstart Owner shall complete and sign Section II of this Appendix G to ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 11 (OP-11G), prior to commencement of the\nblackstart capability conversion study. Following completion of the required\nconversion study, if ISO accepts the proposed DBR and the proposed Blackstart\nOwner decides to pursue blackstart conversion of the proposed DBR, then, prior to\ncommencing conversion, the proposed Blackstart Owner and ISO shall complete\nand sign Section III of this OP-11G.\n\nFollowing any required conversion or the determination by ISO and the SRWG that\nthe resource would provide benefit to the Plan if no conversion is required, the\nproposed Blackstart Owner shall perform a successful Blackstart Capability Test on\nthe resource. ISO, upon notice of a successful Blackstart Capability Test for the\nresource, shall coordinate with the Blackstart Owner to complete and sign Section IV\nof this OP-11G. The Designated Blackstart Resource commitment for the resource\nshall begin on the date indicated in the completed Section IV of this OP-11G.\n\nd C ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n## II. ISO and Blackstart Owner Commitment Prior to Blackstart\n Capability Conversion Studies\n\n[Proposed Blackstart Owner] has offered [proposed Designated Blackstart Resource\nname] to provide Blackstart Service in accordance with Schedule 16 - Blackstart\nService of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff. ISO has\ndetermined that [proposed Designated Blackstart Resource name] meets the\ntransmission or distribution technical requirements of the ISO system restoration\ncriteria. [Proposed Blackstart Owner] has been authorized by ISO to conduct a\nblackstart capability conversion study that will assess the viability of converting\n\n[proposed Designated Blackstart Resource name] to be blackstart capable.\n\n[Proposed Blackstart Owner] agrees to conduct the necessary study, provide,\nperiodic updates on the study progress and provide the final study results to ISO and\nthe SRWG.\n\nResource name: ____________\n\nResource ID: ______________\n\nProposed Designated Blackstart Resource name: ______________\n\nProposed Blackstart Owner entity name:\n_____________________________________\n\nName: _____________________________________\n\nSignature: _____________________________________\n\nTitle: _______________________________________\n\nDate: ______________________________________\n\nISO New England Inc.:\n\nName: _____________________________________\n\nSignature: _____________________________________\n\nTitle: Vice President, Chief Financial and Compliance Officer\n\nDate: ______________________________________\n\nd C ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n"},

INTRODUCTION\n\n**A. Background**\n\n1. This Operating Procedure (OP) describes the minimum technical\n\nrequirements for defined generator units described in Section II.A.2 of this\nOP which are referred to as “Generators” for purposes of this OP,\nSettlement Only Resources/Generators (SOGs), Alternative Technology\nRegulation Resources (ATRRs), Asset Related Demands (ARDs)[1],\nDemand Response Resources (DRRs) and Continuous Storage Facilities\n(CSFs) under the control/jurisdiction of ISO New England Inc. (ISO). For\nthe purposes of this OP, “under the control/jurisdiction of ISO” is defined\nas:\n\na. an individual or aggregated asset/resource/unit/facility classification\n\nmeeting the technical criteria as stipulated in Sections II, III, IV, V, VI or\nVII as applicable, or\n\nb. is participating in the wholesale electric market.\n\n2. This OP addresses technical requirements, and not the Offer Data\n\nassociated with these resources for submission to the New England\nMarkets, that may include parameters of a technical nature. This OP is\nmeant to assure, in conjunction with the market structures that the Bulk\nElectric System (BES)[2] of the New England Reliability Coordinator\nArea/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) conforms to proper standards\nof reliability. This OP is also meant to establish technical requirements to\nverify that each Generator, ATRR, ARD, DRR, and CSF has accurate\nmetered data available for ISO dispatch control and settlement.\n\n**B. Standards**\n\n1. Compliance with all applicable ISO OPs is the responsibility of the Lead\n\nMarket Participant (Lead MP) for the Generator, ATRR, ARD, DRR and\nCSF. In the case of a Generator, the Lead MP as used in the ISO OPs is\nthe Lead MP for the Generator Asset and not the Lead MP for the\nGenerating Capacity Resource.\n\nThe Lead MP is responsible for identifying a Designated Entity (DE) or a\nDemand Designated Entity (DDE), as applicable, for each of its resources.\nThe Lead MP shall identify a DE or DDE that has entered into either a\nMarket Participant Service Agreement (MPSA) or a DE/DDE Agreement\nwith the ISO. DEs/DDEs that have not entered into either an MPSA or a\nDE/DDE Agreement with the ISO cannot be the DE/DDE for the Lead\nMPs’ resource(s).A Lead MP is always ultimately responsible for all\nrequirements and obligations assigned to a DE or DDE that is performing\nfunctions for that Lead MP. Each Lead MP shall also comply with all\n\n1 This OP describes minimum technical requirements for Dispatchable Asset Related Demands (DARDs),\n\nwhich are a subset of ARDs.\n\n2 Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\napplicable Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) and North\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) requirements. It is also\nexpected that all elements specified in this OP will be operated utilizing\nGood Utility Practice including making resources available for service as\nsoon as possible after failures of equipment.\n\n## II. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERATORS\n\nThis section describes the basic technical requirements that a Generator shall\nmeet to be considered for offer, dispatch and settlement. Generators shall also\nmeet the eligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (ISO Tariff) and ISO New England\nManuals (ISO Manuals) to offer into the New England Markets.\n\nCriteria used to define registration options outlined in Section II.A.2 shall be used\nfor all generating facilities. All registered SOGs shall comply with the registration\nrequirements of Section II.A.2 of this OP on or before January 1, 2021.\n\n**A. Generator Defined**\n\n1. A Generator shall be defined consistently for all ISO applications for the\n\npurposes of offer, dispatch and settlement. Defined Generators are\nrepresented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS) and shall\ncommunicate with ISO through its approved DE.\n\na. To define a new Generator, a minimum of one hundred and twenty\n\n(120) calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required. To change\ndata for an existing Generator definition, a minimum of seven (7)\ncalendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required. The advance notice\nperiod commences upon ISO receipt of the data detailed in Section\nII.A.6 of this OP.\n\n2. Except as provided for in Sections II.A.3 and II.A.4 below, the registration\n\noptions for a generating facility are as follows:\n\na. A generating facility (of any size) interconnected at 115 kV or above\n\nshall register as a Generator.\n\nb. A generating facility of five (5) MW or greater interconnected below\n\n115 kV shall register as a Generator.\n\nc. A generating facility that is at least one (1) MW and less than five (5)\n\nMW interconnected below 115 kV:\n```\n      o May register as a Generator\n      o May register as a SOG or\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n   o May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not\n\n```\nparticipating in any New England Markets other than as a load\nreducer or regulation provider\n\nd. A generating facility less than one (1) MW interconnected below\n\n115 kV:\n```\n   o May register as a SOG or\n   o May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not\n\n```\nparticipating in any New England Markets other than as a load\nreducer or regulation provider\n\n3. A generating facility that meets the Distributed Generation Definition:\n\n  - May register pursuant to Section II.A.2 above\n\n  - May register as a component of a DRR, On-Peak Demand Resource,\n\nor Seasonal Peak Demand Resource or\n\n  - May elect to not register, or to register as an ATRR only, if not\n\nparticipating in any New England Markets other than as a load reducer\nor regulation provider\n\n4. A generating facility that opts to register as part of an Electric Storage\n\nFacility shall register as a Generator.\n\n5. **Neither a Generator nor an SOG may be registered at the same end-use**\n\ncustomer facility as a Demand Response Asset unless the Generator or\nSOG is separately metered and reported and its output does not reduce\nthe load reported at the Retail Delivery Point of the Demand Response\nAsset.\n\n6. For the purpose of this OP, the aggregated maximum net output at or\n\nabove 0 degrees F and interconnection voltage of a generating facility\nmeasured at the point at which the generating facility interconnects to the\nexisting system are used to determine registration options.\n\n7. For dispersed power generating facilities or distributed energy resources\n\n(excluding load reducers) that are interconnecting to the existing system\nthrough a common point of connection (e.g., a common collector or an\nexpress feeder), the following applies:\n\na. For purposes of this OP, a common collector is a system, usually\n\noperating at distribution or sub-transmission voltage levels, designed\nprimarily for interconnecting capacity to a common point of connection\non an existing transmission or distribution element. Where the existing\npoint of connection is a substation, the interconnection facilities are\ncommonly referred to as an express feeder. An express feeder by\ndefinition serves no load other than that associated with the\n\n\n-----\n\ninterconnected dispersed power generating facilities or distributed\nenergy resource.\n\nb. Where multiple dispersed power generating facilities or distributed\n\nenergy resources are connecting to the existing system through a\ncommon point of connection at the same time, all generating\nfacilities/resources (excluding load reducers) interconnected at the\ncommon collector or express feeder system will be aggregated for\nthe determination of the less than five (5) MW eligibility threshold.\nHowever, a new dispersed power generating facility or distributed\nenergy resource seeking to interconnect at the same common\ncollector or express feeder system as other dispersed power\ngenerating facilities or distributed energy resources will not be\naggregated for the purposes of determining the less than five (5)\nMW eligibility threshold if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(1) the other generating facilities or distributed energy resources on\n\nthe common collector or express feeder system are existing,\nwhich, for purposes of this OP means, with executed\ninterconnection agreements in place; and\n\n(2) the new dispersed power generating facility or distributed\n\nenergy resource is not an Affiliate of the existing generating\nfacilities or distributed energy resources on the common\ncollector or express feeder system at the time of the\ninterconnection request submittal\n\nc. The ISO may waive aggregation of an unaffiliated generating\n\nfacility/resource that would otherwise be aggregated pursuant to\nSection II.A.2.f, if the ISO determines that not aggregating the\nunaffiliated generating facility/resource is acceptable from a reliability\nperspective.\n\n(1) ISO shall consider project information included in the Generation\n\nNotification Form or Proposed Plan Application submitted pursuant\nto Section I.3.9 of the ISO Tariff to determine if multiple points of\nconnection are present.\n\n8. A Lead MP may combine generator units to form a defined Generator\n\nsubject to Section II.C of this OP - Designated Entity - Performance,\nCommunication and Control. Examples of a defined Generator,\ncomposed of multiple generator units, include: multi-unit hydro stations,\nsolar farms, wind farms and most combined-cycle units. A Lead MP’s\nright to combine physical generator units to create a Generator for offer,\ndispatch and settlement is governed by the following rules:\n\na. Generator units being combined shall either be at the same physical\n\nsite or be part of a project that, by its technical nature, requires\ncoordinated control of the various units being combined to form a\nGenerator.\n\n\n-----\n\nb. For a Generator that is a composite of multiple physical generator\n\nunits, only the defined Generator will be represented, acted upon or\nallowed to transact in the various New England Markets.\n\nc. ISO shall determine if generator units located on different electrical\n\nbuses may be combined and defined as a Generator.\n\nd. ISO shall consider if such a combination of generator units interferes\n\nwith effective control of probable constraints or accurate determination\nof system losses, Operating Reserve and Regulation capabilities. The\nappropriateness of these combinations will be reviewed on a\ncontinuing basis.\n\n9. Price offers for generation supply shall only be submitted for a defined\n\nGenerator.\n\n10. ISO shall only perform settlement functions for generation supply for\n\ndefined Generators and SOGs.\n\n11. To define a Generator, the Lead MP shall submit any technical data with\n\nrespect to a Generator that ISO determines to be necessary for ISO to\ncarry out its responsibility of reliably and efficiently operating the power\nsystem. The Lead MP shall submit the technical data for each physical\ncomponent of a unit regardless of it being modeled as a single unit or as\nmultiple aggregations of the physical components of the unit, such as is\nthe case with some hydro units and combined-cycle units. The Lead MP\nshall submit and maintain all requested data for the Generator. A defined\nGenerator shall have an approved DE, provide all required data and have\nall required communications equipment in place and tested in accordance\nwith ISO procedures prior to being available for dispatch. The Lead MP\nshall identify the DE. The Lead MP shall communicate to ISO through the\nidentified DE for dispatch related matters. The data shall include, but may\n**not be limited to, the following, as necessary:**\n\n    - Form NX-12, Generator Technical Data (NX-12) per Appendix A of this\n\nOP\n\n    - Form NX-12D, Generator Reactive Data (NX-12D), per Appendix B of\n\nthis OP and as summarized in Appendix B of ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 12, Voltage and Reactive Control (OP-12)\n\n    - NX-9 data per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16,\n\nTransmission System Data (OP-16)\n\n    - Form NX-9B, Transformer-FIXED/GSU/TCUL[3] per OP-16\n\n    - Form NX-9D, Static Capacitor/Reactor[4] per OP-16\n\n3 Form NX-9B, Transformer-FIXED/GSU/TCUL are terms used/defined in OP-16 Appendix B.\n4 Form NX-9D Static Capacitor/Reactor are terms used/defined in OP-16 Appendix D\n\n\n-----\n\n    - Short circuit data per OP-16\n\n    - Station one-line diagrams\n\n    - Dynamics models for Generators of 5 MW or greater compatible with\n\nPower System Simulator for Engineering (PSSe) including:\n```\n     o Generator, including wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, fuel cells\n\n```\nand any other resource that delivers MW to the electric power\nsystem and meets the definition of a Generator in this OP\n```\n     o Excitation System\n     o Governor\n     o Power System Stabilizer (if equipped)\n     o Models (both standard library models and user-written models)\n\n```\nshall be consistent with the current version of the ISO New England\nCompliance Bulletin - MOD-032 - ISO New England’s Model Data\nRequirements and Reporting Procedures posted at:\n\n[https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc)\n\nAll Generator dynamics models, including initial and updated models, shall\nbe provided to ISO using the Dynamics Data Management System\n(DDMS)[5]. Updated Generator dynamics models shall be provided to ISO\nprior to making changes to equipment that is part of a Generator\n(including but not limited to excitation and governor equipment). Changes\nto the above listed facilities shall be made in accordance with ISO Tariff\nSection I.3.9 and the Interconnection Procedures. Specified verification of\ngenerator dynamics models is also required in accordance with NERC\nReliability Standards MOD-026, Verification of Models and Data for\nGenerator Excitation Control System or Plant Volt/Var Control Functions,\nand MOD-027, Verification of Models and Data for Turbine/Governor and\nLoad Control or Active Power/Frequency Control Functions. Updates to\nexisting models as well as proposed modeling changes shall be provided\nto ISO, as required by MOD-026 and MOD-027, using DDMS. Lead MPs\nshall initiate the data review by submitting the proposed MOD-026 and\nMOD-027 data changes in DDMS. All MOD-026 and MOD-027 data\nchanges shall be submitted concurrently so that these changes can be\nreviewed simultaneously. Data submissions for MOD-026 and MOD027shall include comparison curves of tests with model simulations and\nactual unit responses along with test reports. For further details refer to\nISO Compliance Bulletin-MOD-026, MOD-027 & Tariff Provision of\nValidated Dynamics Models to ISO New England located at:\n\n5 Generator developers provide initial dynamics models for proposed facilities using the Interconnection Request\nTracking Tool (IRTT). The ISO performs the initial entry of as-studied model information into DDMS once the\nSystem Impact Study is completed and approved. Lead MPs input as-purchased and as-built model data into DDMS\nprior to Commercial operation\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/nerc-npcc)\n\nISO shall initiate recertification of models for existing Generators annually\nin the first quarter of each calendar year in accordance with MOD-032 and\nthis OP. Lead MPs for Generators shall indicate that the model\nrepresents the Generator as configured, including Automatic Voltage\nRegulator (AVR) and governor response, or that a change has been\nmade. Recertification or information showing changes shall be provided\nto ISO within 45 calendar days of the initial ISO request. Responses to\nMOD-032 submittal requests shall be provided to ISO using DDMS. The\nISO request for recertification shall include the modeling information\ncurrently maintained by ISO. Refer to ISO New England Compliance\nBulletin - MOD-032 for additional information on Generator characteristics.\n\nISO may identify technical concerns with dynamic models and return the\nmodels to Lead MPs for review with a description of any technical\nconcerns. Lead MPs shall review models and update the models as\nrequired to address any technical concerns. Lead MPs shall provide\ndocumented reviews addressing the technical concern with updates as\nrequired within 90 calendar days of receipt of the description of the\ntechnical concern or as specified by the associated NERC Reliability\nStandard. These requests and Lead MP responses shall be made using\nDDMS.\n\n  - Power Systems Computer-Aided Design (PSCAD) models for\n\ngenerators using power electronic equipment (e.g., wind generators,\npower inverter equipment). Models shall be provided to ISO by the\nmethod described with the request.\n\n  - DE registration per M-RPA\n\n  - Nuclear Generator Lead MPs shall provide proposed Nuclear Plant\n\nInterface Requirements (NPIRs) in accordance with Master/Local\nControl Center Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission\nOperations (M/LCC 1)\n\n12. Equipment Requirements:\n\na. Telemetry equipment as defined by ISO New England Operating\n\nProcedure No.18 - Metering and Telemetering Criteria (OP-18).\n\nb. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) that control more than five (5)\n\ndispatchable Generators must be reviewed and approved by ISO\nOperations and must meet the requirements in OP-18 Appendix F,\nSection 3.5.\n\nc. For Generators that are participating in the Energy Market and/or are\n\ndispatchable in Real-Time, communications equipment, hardware and\nsoftware sufficient to enable the DE to receive, acknowledge receipt as\nnecessary, and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions electronically\nand, if necessary, verbally in a timely manner are required by ISO\nManuals and ISO New England Administrative Procedures\n\n\n-----\n\n(Administrative Procedures). Participation in the Energy Market and\nForward Reserve Market is conditioned upon having Electronic\nDispatch Capability (EDC) installed. EDC is the ability, through the\ninstallation and maintenance of adequate hardware and software and\ncommunications infrastructure within the Continental United States, to\nprovide for the electronic transmission, receipt, and acknowledgment\nof data relative to the dispatch of Generators to carry out the RealTime dispatch processes from ISO issuance of Dispatch Instructions to\nthe actual increase or decrease in output of dispatchable Generators.\nThe hardware, software, and communications infrastructure may be\nlocated outside the Continental United States if agreed to on a caseby-case basis by ISO. Generators are considered to have EDC when\nthey are capable of receiving, responding to, and changing output in\nresponse to electronic Dispatch Instructions issued to the ISO CFE\nconnected RTU of the DE.\n\nd. In the event of a failure of the ISO CFE connected RTU or the failure of\n\ncommunications or other equipment between the ISO CFE connected\nRTU and the Generators connected to the ISO CFE connected RTU,\nthe DE acting on behalf of the Lead MP shall convey the Dispatch\nInstructions issued by ISO to the generating unit(s) impacted by the\nequipment failure within the time and other constraints established by\nISO Manuals and OPs, and shall diligently pursue the repair and/or\nreplacement of failed facilities on an expedited basis.\n\n13. Whenever a Lead MP seeks to establish or change the DE responsible for\n\nmanaging dispatch for one or more of its Generator(s), the Lead MP and\nDE are responsible for demonstrating to ISO that the proposed DE meets\nthe technical requirements set forth in this OP prior to the ISO approving\nthe proposed change(s) to become effective.\n\n14. Generators shall provide and maintain up-to-date contact information to\n\nthe applicable Local Control Center (LCC).\n\n**B. Telemetering and Revenue Metering**\n\n1. Telemetering for the Generator shall meet the requirements for speed\n\nand accuracy of OP-18. The Lead MP shall maintain and calibrate\ntelemetering on an ongoing basis pursuant to OP-18.\n\n2. Revenue metering shall meet the requirements of OP-18. Meter readings\n\nshall be forwarded to ISO for settlement, in a timely manner, as required\nby ISO Manuals and Administrative Procedures. The Lead MP shall\nmaintain and calibrate revenue metering per the ISO requirements in OP18.\n\n3. Metering requirements and modeling options in the EMS and market\n\nsystems for units less than five (5) MW will depend on their registration\nchoice:\n\n\n-----\n\na. Each Generator that is represented in the EMS and market systems\n\nshall meet the telemetering and revenue metering requirements\ndescribed in II.B.1 and II.B.2 above.\n\nb. Each generating facility that registers as a SOG shall only meet the\n\nrevenue metering requirements described in II.B.2 above; there are no\ntelemetering requirements.\n\nc. Each generating facility that is not registered does not need\n\ntelemetering.\n\n**C. Designated Entity - Performance, Communication and Control**\n\nDE Performance, Communication and Control for Continuous Storage\nFacilities (CSFs) is governed by Section VII.B. For all other Generators:\n\n1. Each DE shall provide dispatch services from a single physical location for\n\na defined Generator and shall be the single point of contact to receive,\nacknowledge receipt, and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions and\nrelated communications. If prior approval from the ISO control room has\nbeen obtained, the operation from a single physical location allows for\nexigent conditions, as well as for infrequent, periodic testing & training\nneeds.\n\n- - **No entity shall be recognized as a DE unless the entity meets the**\n\nrequirements in this OP and has been registered pursuant to ISO MRPA.\n\n      - All DE contact information shall be confirmed and/or updated by the\n\nDE on an annual basis or upon change.\n\n2. Each DE shall comply with all requirements of the ISO Operating\n\nDocuments to the same extent as if the Lead MP were carrying out the\nfunctions of the DE.\n\n3. ISO shall communicate with the DE via electronic dispatch through an ISO\n\nconnected RTU or voice communications through an automatic ringdown\ntelephone circuit or one of the dedicated 24x7 phone numbers identified\nduring DE registration in accordance with M-RPA.\n\n4. The DE shall have the knowledge and authority to act on ISO Dispatch\n\nInstructions for all ISO registered assets it manages for dispatch, as\ndefined in Section II.F of this OP - Dispatch Instructions.\n\na. Any control equipment used to start, stop or vary the output of the\n\nGenerator, from a remote location, shall meet the speed, accuracy and\ndata channel requirements set in OP-18. Such equipment shall be\nmaintained by the Lead MP according to ISO requirements contained\nin OP-18 and ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 2 Maintenance of Communications, Computers, Metering and Computer\n\n\n-----\n\nSupport Equipment (OP-2). ISO System Operators[6] shall be notified\nas soon as practicable if the equipment is incapable of meeting the\nrequirements of OP-18. Steps shall be taken to restore the equipment\nto normal operating conditions as soon as possible in accordance with\nOP-2.\n\nb. Each DE shall have, to the fullest extent possible, a dedicated voice\n\ncommunication landline telephone system with an assigned public\nswitched network landline phone number for ISO dispatching\npurposes. If the DE cannot procure a landline telephone system, then\nan alternate or diverse method of communications, such as a cellular\ntelephone line with an assigned cellular phone number, shall be\nprovided, unless otherwise agreed to on a case-by-case basis by ISO.\n\n5. In addition to the dedicated voice communication telephone, each DE is\n\nrequired to have a dedicated automatic ringdown telephone circuit to the\nISO control room for any of the following unless ISO otherwise agrees on\na case-by-case basis.\n\n    - Each DE managed dispatchable Generator or aggregate of\n\ndispatchable generation greater than or equal to fifty (50) MW (net)\n\n    - A Generator providing Regulation service\n\n    - Other instances as determined on a case-by-case basis by ISO\n\nFurther, certain Generators are critical to the BES under emergency\nconditions. These Generators are listed in Appendix D of this OP and\nshall install, maintain, operate, test and fund a voice communication\nsystem that is independent of the public switched network for the\npurposes of communicating with its LCC during system emergencies\nsuch as a system restoration event. The installation, maintenance,\ntesting and operation of the communications system shall be coordinated\nwith, and acceptable to, the LCC for that Generator. Each LCC, in turn, is\nresponsible for providing the requirements for the communications\nsystem and coordinating with each applicable Generator to effect the\ninstallation, operation and testing of the communications system.\n\n6. Each DE for a Generator that participates in the New England Markets\n\nshall have equipment capable of reliably receiving and acknowledging\nreceipt of Dispatch Instructions sent electronically by ISO as frequently as\nnecessary and to implement Dispatch Instructions in a timely manner as\nrequired by ISO Manuals and Administrative Procedures.\n\n7. Each DE shall display to their DE Operator, the following parameters for\n\neach dispatchable Generator, as defined in Section II.A.12 of this OP, in\nNew England that is under their responsibility.\n\n    - ACK Required (i.e., Acknowledgement Required)\n\n6 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Message Type\n\n(1) Normal\n\n(2) Emergency\n\n(3) Start Up\n\n(4) Shut Down\n\n   - Desired Dispatch Point (DDP)\n\n   - Actual Generation\n\n   - Economic Minimum Limit\n\n   - Economic Maximum Limit\n\n   - Emergency Minimum Limit\n\n   - Response Rate\n\n    - Regulation High Limit (where applicable)\n\n   - Regulation Low Limit (where applicable)\n\n   - Unit Control Mode\n\n   - Heartbeat\n\n8. Acknowledgement and response to electronic dispatch via the human\n\nmachine interface of the RTU shall also be performed at the same location\nas the voice communications unless otherwise agreed to on a case-bycase basis by ISO.\n\na. Each DE shall maintain staff on duty to communicate with ISO System\n\nOperators at all times.\n\nb. Dispatch instructions for each Generator shall only be acknowledged\n\nby the approved DE.\n\nc. Each DE shall have equipment capable of reliably receiving and\n\ndisplaying to its operators the data in accordance with Section II.B. of\nthis OP for each Generator it manages for dispatch\n\nd. In instances where a Dispatch Instruction or any other order is issued\n\nverbally by an ISO System Operator, the verbal communication shall\ntake precedence over all other forms of communication.\n\n**D. Designated Entity - Modifying DE Details**\n\n1. ISO shall evaluate all submitted DE change, registration or modification\n\nrequests according to the required lead times with the requirements stated\n\n\n-----\n\nin this OP. ISO shall coordinate with each applicable Lead MP,\ntransitioning DE, communication vendor, and any other authorized party in\norder to process requests.\n\n2. A Lead MP shall provide at least thirty (30) calendar days’ notice to\n\nchange the DE, as defined in M-RPA.\n\na. The effective date of the transfer is contingent on the proposed DE\n\nmeeting the technical requirements and being registered and approved\nin accordance with M-RPA.\n\nb. Change requests concerning the DE communications infrastructure,\n\nmoving the DE location, or changing the contact details shall only be\nsubmitted by a DE, as following:\n\n1) Changes to dedicated telephone numbers require at least thirty\n\n(30) calendar days’ advance notice.\n\n2) Modifications to dedicated communications circuits (e.g., for\n\nautomatic ringdown and/or RTU) require at least ninety (90)\ncalendar days’ advance notice.\n\n3) Contact details including person performing a role, their phone\n\nnumber and / or email address require at least seven (7) Business\nDays’ advance notice.\n\nc. ISO approval of the change shall be contingent on the verification by\n\nISO of the successful implementation and testing of the technical\ncapabilities.\n\n**E. Emergency Message Indications**\n\nThe requirements of this section are not applicable to DNE Dispatchable\nGenerators or CSFs as they do not receive Emergency Dispatch Instructions.\n\n1. Emergency messages shall be displayed to each DE with visual and audible\n\nindications:\n\na. Each Generator shall have a specific message type indicator.\n\nb. Each DE shall not employ visual messages that are common to\n\nmultiple Generators.\n\nc. Emergency messages shall have an audible alarm that is unique to\n\nemergency messages and cannot be disabled.\n\nd. Emergency messages shall be “Message Type 2” (Emergency).\n\ne. Messages that require acknowledgement shall have an “ACK Required\n\n= 1” on the RTU.\n\n\n-----\n\n**F. Dispatch Instructions**\n\nDispatch Instructions for Generators that are part of CSFs are governed by\nSection VII.C of this OP. For all other Generators:\n\n1. All Dispatch Instructions (Includes normal and emergency)\n\na. If a DE is not capable of controlling the delivery of energy in\n\naccordance with its Offer Data, the DE shall notify the ISO System\nOperators as soon as practicable. Efforts should be made to forecast\nGenerator capabilities based on daily local conditions and submit\nthose parameters appropriately.\n\n2. Normal Dispatch Instructions\n\na. Normal Dispatch Instructions shall be transmitted electronically to each\n\nDE every five minutes or less, depending on system conditions.\n\nb. Manual acknowledgement of a normal Dispatch Instruction is not\n\nrequired; however, compliance with the Dispatch Instruction shall be in\naccordance with Offer Data without delay.\n\nc. Fast Start Generators shall receive start-up and shutdown messages\n\nwhich shall be acknowledged by the DE within sixty (60) seconds.\nThis acknowledgement requires physical action by staff at the DE.\nThis item may be waived on a case-by-case basis by the ISO.\nAcknowledgement of a start-up or shutdown message shall indicate\nthe DE intent to immediately comply with the Dispatch Instruction.\n\nd. Fast Start Generators shall not be shut down without receiving a\n\nshutdown message. A DDP below the Economic Minimum Limit that is\n**not accompanied by a shutdown message is considered a dispatch to**\nthe Generator Economic Minimum Limit.\n\ne. Under normal Dispatch Instructions, voice communications to the ISO\n\ncontrol room related to the Dispatch Instructions should be limited to\nonly those pertaining to clarifying the Dispatch Instructions.\n\n3. Emergency Dispatch Instructions\n\nThe requirements of this section are not applicable to DNE Dispatchable\nGenerators or CSFs as they do not receive Emergency Dispatch\nInstructions.\n\na. Emergency messages will be issued by the ISO System Operators\n\nwhen an emergency issue requires an immediate response by\nGenerators outside of the normal dispatch protocol.\n\nb. Emergency Dispatch Instructions shall be transmitted electronically to\n\neach DE every five minutes or less, depending on system conditions.\n\n\n-----\n\nc. Emergency messages shall be acknowledged by the DE within sixty\n\n(60) seconds of receipt of the message. This acknowledgement\nrequires physical action by staff at the DE. This item may be waived\non a case-by-case basis by ISO. Acknowledgement of the emergency\nmessage shall indicate the DE intent to immediately comply with the\nDispatch Instruction.\n\nd. Emergency Dispatch Instructions shall be followed in accordance with\n\nOffer Data without delay.\n\ne. In an emergency, off-line Fast Start Generators that are called on to\n\nstart will receive an emergency message and a non-zero DDP in lieu\nof a start-up message. The DDP that accompanies the emergency\nmessage dictates the desired response from the Fast Start Generator.\nThe DE shall take action to comply with the Dispatch Instructions in\naccordance with their Offer Data.\n\nf. Fast Start Generators shall not be shut down without receiving a\n\nshutdown message. A DDP below the Economic Minimum Limit that is\n**not accompanied by a shutdown message is considered a dispatch to**\nthe Generator Economic Minimum Limit.\n\ng. While the emergency message is active, voice communication to the\n\nISO control room related to the Dispatch Instructions should be limited\nto only those pertaining to clarifying the Dispatch Instructions.\n\n**G. Operational Considerations**\n\n1. A Generator shall be dispatched as directed by ISO in accordance with\n\nISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1 - Central Dispatch\nOperating Responsibilities and Authority (OP-1), and the operating\ncharacteristics submitted by the Lead MP. The safety of operating\npersonnel and prevention of damage to equipment are the sole\nresponsibility of the Lead MP, and shall be the priority at all times.\n\n2. Each Generator that is treated as a SOG may have additional\n\nresponsibility under ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action\nDuring a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4).\n\n3. Both the Planned Outages and Maintenance Outages[7] of the Generator\n\nshall be performed in accordance with ISO generator maintenance\nscheduling procedures per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 Resource Maintenance and Outage Scheduling. (OP-5)\n\n4. The Lead MP shall, at all times, comply with all applicable switching and\n\ntagging procedures in effect by the authorities governing switching and\ntagging operations in the field.\n\n7 Planned Outage and Maintenance Outage are defined in OP-5\n\n\n-----\n\n**H. Voltage Control**\n\n1. The MVAr production of a Generator is an important factor in the reliable\n\noperation of the New England RCA/BAA. Each Lead MP for a Generator\ninterconnected at 69 kV or higher voltage shall support system voltage\nand reactive needs at the direction of ISO and the LCC per OP-12. Each\nGenerator in the New England RCA/BAA normally follows a schedule of\nbus voltages, which is specified for both On-Peak and Off-Peak[8] load\nperiods as contained in OP-12, Appendix B, or as otherwise specified by\nISO or an LCC. ISO and the LCC shall have the authority to direct the\nLead MP to deviate from the normal voltage schedule to address\noperating situations. Each Generator shall participate, to the limit of their\ncapability as documented in its NX-12D and as summarized in OP-12,\nAppendix B, and maintain their assigned voltage schedule as directed by\nISO or the LCC and to comply with any variations that ISO or the LCC\nmay request.\n\nNew generators subject to the ISO’s Interconnection Procedures shall\nfollow the AVR requirements of OP 14. New generators interconnecting\nthrough a state interconnection process shall follow the AVR requirements\nof the interconnecting utility. Existing generators (ranging from active\ncommercial generators to generators that have begun the system\ninterconnection study (study scoping has started) prior to the effective\ndate of Revision 34 of this procedure) interconnected at voltages below 69\nkV which have AVR requirements due to OP-14 shall retain the need for\nAVR control, unless the interconnecting utility exempts the generator from\nthe AVR obligation and such generator shall meet the voltage\nrequirements documented in its interconnection study.\n\n2. The Lead MP shall keep and maintain an automatic voltage regulator\n\n(AVR) in service and regulating to the voltage schedule on all generating\nunits comprising a Generator unless granted an exemption under the\nprovisions in Section 5 of Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 8 Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System\nStabilizer Outages (M/LCC 8). Generators that have applied for and\nreceived an exemption shall be listed in M/LCC 8, Attachment A Generators Exempted From AVR Requirements.\n\n3. Each Lead MP (except those for whom an exemption has been granted,\n\nas described in Section II.H.2) shall maintain the AVR in good operating\ncondition.\n\n4. Each Lead MP shall provide to ISO on ISO Form NX-12D - Generator\n\nReactive Data Form, in accordance with Appendix B of this OP,\ninformation describing the periods of time when conditions occur (if any)\nwhere the Lead MP routinely expects that its Generator will not operate\nwith the AVR in service and controlling voltage (such as during start-up or\nshutdown).\n\n8 On-Peak and Off-Peak are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Actual or expected changes in AVR Operating status shall be reported in\n\nReal-Time in accordance with OP-12 and M/LCC 8, unless the\nrequirement for such Real-Time reporting of AVR operating status is\nautomatically waived during the periods of time when Real-Time\nconditions occur that are as described by the Lead MP on the Form NX12D pertaining to when the Lead MP routinely expects that its Generator\nwill not operate with the AVR in service and controlling voltage (such as\nduring start-up or shutdown). When such conditions occur that match the\nconditions described on Form NX-12D, this serves as advance standing\nnotification and Real-Time reporting is not required.\n\n**I. Governor Control**\n\nWhere not already required to do so pursuant to the Interconnection\nAgreement, each Lead MP shall provide, maintain and operate a\n“functioning governor” on each Generator with a capability of ten (10) MW\nor greater. The conditions of interconnection applicability noted in II.H.1\nfor AVRs shall also be applied to governor control.\n\nNew generators subject to the ISO’s Interconnection Procedures shall\nfollow the governor control requirements of OP 14. New generators\ninterconnecting through a state interconnection process shall follow the\ngovernor control requirements of the interconnecting utility. Existing\ngenerators (ranging from active commercial generators to generators that\nhave begun the system interconnection study (study scoping has started)\nprior to the effective date of Revision 34 of this procedure interconnected\nat voltages below 69 kV which have governor control requirements due to\nOP-14 shall retain the need for AVR control, unless the interconnecting\nutility exempts the generator from the governor control obligation and such\ngenerator shall meet the voltage requirements documented in its\ninterconnection study.\n\n1. For the purposes of this OP, a “functioning governor” includes hardware or\n\nsoftware that provides autonomous frequency-responsive power control.\nThis requirement applies to all conventional Generators and nonconventional power sources including but not limited to: defined\nGenerator Assets, aggregated Generator Assets, wind turbine Generator\nAssets, all elements of a photovoltaic Generator Asset, etc. The\nequipment providing “governor functionality” shall be set such that:\n\na. It has a speed droop based on nameplate capability or the value\n\ndetermined in Section II.A.2 of this OP set with a maximum of five\npercent (5%);\n\nb. It has a frequency response deadband of no greater than 59.964\n60.036 Hz; and\n\nc. The real power response is not inhibited by effects of outer loop\n\ncontrols (such as operator setpoint controls and load control but\nexcluding AGC) that would override the governor response (including\n\n\n-----\n\nblocked or nonfunctioning governors or modes of operating that limit\nFrequency Response[9]). Meeting this requirement results in providing\nprimary frequency response.\n\n2. Upon ISO request, the Lead MP shall verify that actual governor operation\n\nin response to load control and/or active power/frequency control\napproximates the specified droop. Verification shall be in the form of Plant\nInformation (PI) data indicating MW response to frequency events during\na fifteen (15) minute interval (MW and Hz timestamp data five (5) minutes\nprior and ten (10) minutes post an identified frequency event).\n\n3. The DE, acting on behalf of the Lead MP, shall inform ISO of actual or\n\nexpected changes in governor operating status per Master/Local Control\nCenter Procedure No. 10 - Generator Governor Control and Operation\n(M/LCC 10). Each Lead MP is responsible for periodic testing and\nmaintenance of the Generator governor.\n\n4. Except as otherwise provided in the Interconnection Agreement, ISO shall\n\nconsider a well-documented and technically valid request to be exempt\nfrom the requirements of this Section II.I. All requests shall be submitted\nthrough “Ask ISO” and shall include “Governor Exemption Request” with\nthe Asset name and ID number in the issue summary. Any such request\nshall be reviewed by ISO technical staff for acceptability. Any Generator\nwhose exemption is accepted shall be listed on a governor exemption list\nin M/LCC 10 Attachment A - Generators Exempted from Governor\nRequirements. A Generator listed in M/LCC 10 Attachment A either does\n**not have a governor or does not operate its governor in conformance with**\nthe requirements in this OP. For all such Generators, ISO has reviewed\nthe impact of this status and has determined that this status is acceptable\nfrom a reliability perspective. If evaluation is needed ISO will undertake\nevaluation under ISO Tariff Section I.3.9. All governor exemption\nrequests shall be reported to the Reliability Committee. If accepted by\nISO, the Generator Asset and unit, if applicable, will be listed in M/LCC 10\nAttachment A. The exemption process shall only consider a full\nexemption from all governor requirements.\n\nAddition to the exemption list does not preclude reevaluation required\nwith changes processed through the Large Generator Interconnection\nProcedure (LGIP) / Small Generator Interconnection Procedure (SGIP)\nSchedules 22 and 23, respectively. These exemption criteria do not\nrelieve that resource from adhering to any other ISO New England\nOperating Documents or program requirements.\n\n**J. Interconnection**\n\n1. A Generator seeking to connect its facilities to transmission facilities shall\n\nhave a valid Interconnection Agreement(s) in place with the Transmission\nOwners(s) with which the Generator is seeking to interconnect, or whose\nfacilities are impacted. The terms and conditions of said Interconnection\n\n9 Frequency Response is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\nAgreement(s) shall be negotiated between the entities that are parties to\nthe Interconnection Agreement(s) and may or may not contain additional\nand/or more stringent requirements than those prescribed by ISO.\n\n**K. System Protection**\n\n1. At a minimum, each Lead MP shall install and maintain protection systems\n\nin accordance with the NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory # 4\n\n    - Bulk Power System Protection Criteria (NPCC Directory #4) on each unit\nthat is large enough to affect the systems of others. Each Lead MP shall\nmaintain and upgrade the protection system such that it continues to meet\nthe reliability criteria of NPCC.\n\n2. Relay maintenance and testing that would in any way degrade the level of\n\nsystem protection or system reliability provided by the unit shall not occur\nwhile the unit is on-line. All requests for such maintenance shall adhere to\nthe requirements of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Maintenance Outage Scheduling (OP-3), and local\nscheduling procedures at the lower voltage levels.\n\n3. NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC-01 identifies thresholds for\n\nsetting underfrequency trip protection for generators. The Lead MP for a\nGenerator shall verify that its Generator meets the appropriate figure in\nPRC-006-NPCC-01 for underfrequency tripping unless it has arranged\ncompensatory load shedding with a Distribution Provider or Transmission\nOwner in the same underfrequency island and in accordance with the\nstandard.[10]\n\n**L. Power System Stabilizers**\n\n1. Where power system stabilizer (PSS) equipment is installed on a\n\nGenerator for the purpose of maintaining system stability, the Lead MP\nshall maintain the PSS equipment in good operating condition, and\npromptly report to ISO any problems interfering with PSS proper\noperation. The Lead MP shall operate the PSS out-of-service unless\ndirected otherwise per the unit’s System Impact Study (SIS) or as directed\nby other studies as may be performed by ISO. A listing of Generators\nrequired to have a PSS in-service can be found in M/LCC 8, Attachment B\n\n    - Generators Requiring PSS Devices In/Out of Service. Each Lead MP\nshall promptly report to ISO or the appropriate dispatch center, if and\nwhen the PSS is intended to be either placed into or removed from service\nprior to taking such action unless warranted by emergency plant\nconditions.\n\n10 Requirement R 13 of PRC-006-NPCC-01 provides that “[e]ach Generator Owner shall set each\ngenerator underfrequency trip relay, if so equipped, below the appropriate generator underfrequency trip\nprotection settings threshold curve in Figure 1, except as otherwise exempted in Requirements R16 and\nR19.” (Emphasis added). In a September 22, 2015 presentation, NPCC provided a compliance\nclarification under which setting underfrequency trip relays “on or below the curve” is acceptable to show\ncompliance with Requirement R 13 of PRC-006-NPCC-01\n\n\n-----\n\n**M. Blackstart Capability**\n\n1. Each Lead MP for a Generator that provides blackstart capability from\n\none of their Generators and that Generator has been incorporated in\nthe ISO system restoration plan and/or as defined by ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 11 - Blackstart Resource\nAdministration (OP-11) must maintain that Generator in good\noperating condition. Each Lead MP shall promptly report to ISO, or\nthe appropriate dispatch center, any problems interfering with the\nblackstart capability of each such Designated Blackstart Resource\n(DBR) Generator.\n\n**N. Additional Requirements for Wind Powered Generators**\n\n1. Appendix F - Wind Plant Operator Guide details the criteria and\n\nrequirements for wind powered Generators not operating as part of a CSF\nand shall be used by MPs for interconnected operation. The requirements\nshall be in effect and become enforceable upon installation of the\ncommunications equipment necessary to perform the data transfer.\n\n**O. Additional Requirements for Solar Powered Generators**\n\n1. Appendix H – Solar Plant Operator Guide details the criteria and\n\nrequirements for solar -powered Generators not operating as part of a\nCSF and shall be used by MPs for interconnected operation. The\nrequirements shall be in effect and become enforceable upon installation\nof the communication equipment necessary to perform the data transfer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## III. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY REGULATION RESOURCES (ATRRs)\n\nThis section describes the basic technical requirements that shall be met by each\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resource (ATRR) to be considered in the\nRegulation Market offer process. However, each ATRR shall meet other\neligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO Tariff and ISO Manuals to offer\ninto the New England Markets.\n\n**A. ATRR Defined**\n\n1. Each ATRR shall be defined consistently for all ISO applications. That is,\n\nit shall be defined in the same manner for the purposes of Regulation\noffers, dispatch and settlement. Each ATRR shall communicate with ISO\nthrough its approved DE. Registration of an ATRR will be subject to the\nprovisions of ISO Tariff Section I.3.9, to the extent that the operation of the\nproposed ATRR may have a significant effect on the stability, reliability or\noperating characteristics of the New England RCA/BAA. A defined ATRR\nthat is not part of a CSF shall only be dispatched via electronic dispatch\nfor Regulation service.\n\n2. The Lead MP right to aggregate sub-resources to define an ATRR for\n\noffer, dispatch and settlement shall be governed by the following rules:\n\na. An ATRR associated with a CSF cannot be composed of an\n\naggregation of sub-resources.\n\nb. Individual sub-resources shall be less than one (1) MW of Regulation\n\nCapacity. If greater than or equal to one (1) MW of Regulation\nCapacity, it shall register as a separate ATRR.\n\nc. ISO shall determine if sub-resources may be combined and defined as\n\none ATRR.\n\nd. ISO shall consider if such a combination of sub-resources interferes\n\nwith effective control and/or system reliability.\n\n3. To define an ATRR, the Lead MP shall submit any technical data with\n\nrespect to an ATRR and any sub-resources when ISO determines it is\nnecessary for ISO to carry out its responsibility of reliable and efficient\noperation of the BES. The Lead MP shall submit the technical data for\neach sub-resource irrespective of it being a single unit or an aggregation.\nThe Lead MP shall submit and maintain all requested data of the ATRR.\nA defined ATRR shall have an approved DE, provide all required data and\nhave all required communications equipment in place and tested in\naccordance with ISO procedures prior to being available for dispatch. The\nLead MP shall identify the DE. The Lead MP shall communicate to ISO\nthrough the identified DE. The data may include, but not be limited to, the\nfollowing, as necessary:\n\na. ATRR Technical Data per Appendix G of this OP\n\n\n-----\n\nb. Textual description of the technical and operational characteristics of\n\neach sub-resource\n\nc. One-line diagrams\n\nd. Registration per M-RPA (includes DE registration, as necessary)\n\n4. Equipment Requirements:\n\na. Telemetering as defined by OP-18\n\nb. RTUs that control more than five (5) ATRRs must be reviewed and\n\napproved by ISO operations and must meet the requirements in OP18F Section 3.5.and Section 3.6.5\n\nc. Communications equipment, hardware and software shall be sufficient\n\nto enable the DE to receive, acknowledge receipt, and implement ISO\nDispatch Instructions electronically and, if necessary, verbally in a\ntimely manner as required by ISO Manuals and Administrative\nProcedures.  Participation in the Regulation Market is conditioned\nupon having Electronic Dispatch Capability (EDC) installed. EDC is\nthe ability, through the installation and maintenance of adequate\nhardware and software and communications infrastructure within the\nContinental United States, to provide for the electronic transmission of\ndata relative to the dispatch to carry out the Real-Time dispatch\nprocesses from ISO issuance of Dispatch Instructions to the actual\nincrease or decrease in injection or consumption of ATRR(s). The\nhardware and software and communications infrastructure may be\nlocated outside the Continental United States if agreed to on a caseby-case basis by ISO. An ATRR is considered to have EDC when it is\ncapable of receiving, responding to, and changing output in response\nto electronic Dispatch Instructions issued to the ISO CFE-connected\nRTU of its DE.\n\n5. To define a new ATRR, a minimum of one hundred and twenty (120)\n\ncalendar days’ advance notice to ISO is required.\n\nTo change data for an existing ATRR definition:,\n\n  - A minimum of seven (7) calendar days’ advance notice to ISO is\n\nrequired. The advance notice period commences upon ISO receipt of\nthe criteria detailed in Section III.A.3 of this OP.\n\n  - Dispatch methodology may be changed to be effective at the start of\n\nevery calendar quarter. Requests to change the dispatch method of\nan ATRR shall be received no later than thirty (30) Business Days\nbefore the requested effective date of the change. There are three (3)\ndispatch methodology selections\n```\n   o Continuous - energy neutral\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n     o Trinary - energy neutral\n     o Continuous - non-energy neutral (not available for an ATRR\n\n```\nassociated with a CSF)\n\n6. Whenever a Lead MP wishes to establish or change the DE responsible\n\nfor managing dispatch for its ATRR(s), the Lead MP and DE shall\ndemonstrate to ISO that the proposed DE meets the technical\nrequirements set forth in this OP prior to ISO approving the proposed\nchange to become effective.\n\n**B. Telemetering and Revenue Metering**\n\n1. Telemetering shall be maintained and calibrated by the Lead MP or their\n\ndesignee on an ongoing basis per OP-18. ISO does not specify how the\nDE shall communicate with or obtain telemetering data from the subresource(s). However, the telemetering requirement for the ATRR to\nprovide data to ISO shall meet the speed and accuracy requirements of\nOP-18. Metering requirements for ATRRs and any/all sub-resource(s)\nless than five (5) MW shall depend on their modeling option in the EMS\nand market systems:\n\na. Each ATRR, either as single or aggregate, greater than five (5) MW at\n\na single node is represented in the EMS and shall meet the\ntelemetering requirements described in III.B.1 above\n\n**C. DE - Performance, Communication and Control**\n\nDE Performance, Communication and Control for CSFs is governed by\nSection VII.B of this OP. For all other ATRRs:\n\n1. Each DE shall provide dispatch services from a single physical location for\n\na defined ATRR and shall be the single point of contact to receive,\nacknowledge receipt, and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions and\nrelated communications. If prior approval from the ISO control room has\nbeen obtained, the operation from a single physical location shall allow for\nexigent conditions, as well as for infrequent, periodic testing & training\nneeds.\n\n    - **No entity shall be recognized as a DE unless it meets the**\n\nrequirements in this OP and has been registered pursuant to M-RPA.\n\n    - All DE contact information shall be confirmed and/or updated by the\n\nDE on an annual basis or upon change.\n\n2. Each DE shall comply with all requirements of the ISO Operating\n\nDocuments to the same extent as if the Lead MP were carrying out the\nfunctions of the DE.\n\n3. ISO shall communicate with the DE via electronic dispatch through an ISO\n\nconnected RTU or voice communications through an automatic ringdown\n\n\n-----\n\ntelephone circuit or one of the dedicated 24x7 phone numbers identified\nduring DE registration in accordance with M-RPA.\n\n4. The DE shall have the knowledge and authority to act on ISO Dispatch\n\nInstructions for all ISO registered assets it manages for dispatch, as\ndefined in Section III.E AGC Dispatch Instructions of this OP.\n\na. Any control equipment used to start, stop or vary the output of the\n\nATRR, from a remote location, shall meet the speed, accuracy and\ndata channel requirements of OP-18. Such equipment shall be\nmaintained by the Lead MP according to ISO requirements contained\nin OP-18 and OP-2. ISO System Operators shall be notified as soon\nas practicable if the equipment is incapable of meeting the\nrequirements of OP-18. Steps shall be taken to restore the equipment\nto normal operating conditions as soon as possible pursuant to OP-2.\n\nb. Each DE shall have, to the fullest extent possible, a dedicated voice\n\ncommunication landline telephone system with an assigned public\nswitched network landline phone number for ISO dispatching purposes. If\nthe DE cannot procure a landline telephone system, then an alternate or\ndiverse method of communications, such as a cellular telephone line with\nan assigned cell phone number, shall be provided, unless ISO otherwise\nagrees on a case-by-case basis.\n\n5. In addition to the dedicated voice communication telephone, each DE is\n\nrequired to have a dedicated automatic ringdown telephone circuit to the\nISO control room for any of the following unless ISO otherwise agrees on\na case-by-case basis.\n\n  - Each DE managed ATRR or aggregate of ATRRs greater than or\n\nequal to fifty (50) MW capacity (net)\n\n  - Other instances that ISO determines on a case-by-case basis\n\n6. Each DE for an ATRR shall have equipment capable of reliably receiving\n\nand acknowledging receipt of Dispatch Instructions sent electronically by\nISO as frequently as necessary and to implement Dispatch Instructions in\na timely manner as required by ISO Manuals and Administrative\nProcedures.\n\n7. Each DE shall display to their DE operator, the following parameters for\n\neach ATRR, as defined in Section III.A.4 of this OP, in New England that\nis under their responsibility.\n\na. AGC Setpoint\n\nb. Actual Injection / Consumption\n\nc. Response Rate\n\nd. Regulation High Limit\n\n\n-----\n\ne. Regulation Low Limit\n\nf. ATRR Availability\n\ng. On Regulation Status\n\nh. Heartbeat\n\nATRR parameter display shall be at the same location as the voice\ncommunications unless ISO otherwise agrees on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8. Each DE shall maintain staff on-duty to communicate with ISO System\n\nOperators at all times.\n\n9. Dispatch instructions for each ATRR shall only be acknowledged by the\n\napproved DE.\n\n10. Each DE shall have equipment capable of reliably receiving and displaying\n\nto its operators the data in accordance with Section III.B. - Telemetering\nAnd Revenue Metering for each ATRR it manages for dispatch.\n\n11. Dispatch Instructions or any other operating instructions issued verbally by\n\nISO System Operators shall take precedence over all other forms of\ncommunication.\n\n**D. Designated Entity - Modifying DE Details**\n\n1. ISO shall evaluate each submitted DE change, registration or modification\n\nrequest according to the required lead times with the requirements stated\nin this OP. ISO shall coordinate with each applicable Lead MP,\ntransitioning DE, communication vendor, and any other authorized party in\norder to process the request.\n\n2. A Lead MP shall provide at least thirty (30) calendar days’ notice to\n\nchange the DE, as defined in M-RPA.\n\na. The effective date of the transfer is contingent on the proposed DE\n\nmeeting the technical requirements and being registered and approved\nin accordance with M-RPA.\n\nb. Change requests concerning the DE communications infrastructure,\n\nmoving the DE location, or changing the contact details can only be\nsubmitted by a DE, in accordance with the following:\n```\n     o Changes to dedicated telephone numbers require at least thirty (30)\n\n```\ncalendar days’ advance notice.\n```\n     o Modifications to dedicated communications circuits (e.g., for\n\n```\nautomatic ringdown and/or RTU) require at least ninety (90)\ncalendar days’ advance notice.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n     o Contact details including person performing a role, their phone\n\n```\nnumber and / or email address require at least seven (7) Business\nDays’ advance notice.\n\nc. ISO approval of the change is contingent on the verification by ISO of\n\nthe successful implementation and testing of the technical capabilities.\n\n**E. AGC Dispatch Instructions**\n\nDispatch Instructions for ATRRs that are part of CSFs are governed by\nSection VII.C of this OP. For all other ATRRs:\n\n1. If a DE is not capable of controlling the delivery of Regulation service in\n\naccordance with its Regulation Offer Data, the DE shall notify the ISO\nSystem Operators as soon as practicable. Efforts shall be made to\nforecast ATRR capabilities and submit those parameters appropriately.\n\n2. AGC setpoints are transmitted electronically to each DE every four\n\nseconds or less.\n\n**F. Operational Considerations**\n\n1. An ATRR shall be dispatched as directed by ISO in accordance with OP\n1, and the operating characteristics submitted by the Lead MP. The safety\nof operating personnel and prevention of damage to equipment are the\nsole responsibility of the Lead MP, and shall be the priority at all times.\n\n2. Both Planned Outages and Maintenance Outages of the ATRR shall be\n\nperformed in accordance with ISO Generator maintenance scheduling\nprocedures per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource\nMaintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5).\n\n3. The Lead MP shall, at all times, comply with all applicable switching and\n\ntagging procedures in effect by the authorities governing switching and\ntagging operations in the field.\n\n**G. Voltage Control**\n\n1. An ATRR shall not adversely impact the voltage control performance at\n\nthe point of Interconnection.\n\n**H. Interconnection**\n\n1. An ATRR shall follow the interconnection requirements for the type(s) of\n\nfacility(ies) that will be participating as part of the ATRR. The terms and\nconditions of said Interconnection Agreement(s) shall be negotiated\nbetween the entities that are parties to the Interconnection Agreement(s)\nand may or may not contain additional and/or more stringent requirements\nthan those prescribed by ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\n**I. System Protection**\n\n1. Operation as an ATRR, either by an individual facility or aggregate of sub\nresources, shall have system protection appropriate to the classification of\nthat facility or sub-resource for each interconnection.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IV. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISPATCHABLE ASSET RELATED DEMANDS (DARDS)\n\nThis section describes the basic technical requirements that shall be met by each\nDARD in order for it to be considered in the bidding process. However, each\nDARD shall meet other eligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO Tariff and\nISO Manuals to bid into the New England Markets.\n\n**A. DARDs**\n\n1. Each DARD shall be defined consistently for all ISO applications. That is,\n\nit shall be defined in the same manner for the purposes of bidding,\ndispatch and settlement. Each DARD shall communicate with ISO\nthrough its approved DE.\n\n2. A bid shall only be submitted for a defined DARD. Bid parameters for a\n\nDARD shall be submitted by the Lead MP.\n\n3. ISO shall only perform settlement functions for a defined DARD.\n\n4. Each DARD shall be eligible to provide Operating Reserve in accordance\n\nwith ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 8, Operating Reserve\nand Regulation (OP-8).\n\n5. To define a DARD, each Lead MP shall submit any technical data with\n\nrespect to a DARD that ISO determines to be necessary for ISO to carry\nout its responsibility to reliably and efficiently operate the power system.\nEach Lead MP shall submit and maintain all requested data. The Lead\nMP shall identify the DE. The Lead MP shall communicate to ISO through\nthe identified DE for dispatch-related matters. The technical data shall\ninclude, but is not limited to, the following:\n\na. Dispatchable Asset Related Demand Technical Data, per Appendix E\n\nof this OP\n\nb. NX-9 data as applicable, per OP-16\n\nc. Form NX-9B as applicable, Transformer-FIXED/GSU/TCUL, including\n\neach physical component, per OP-16\n\nd.

The Lead MP or DDE, as applicable, shall maintain the DRR control\n\nequipment in good operating condition, and shall promptly report to\nISO any problems interfering with its proper operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## VII. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUOUS STORAGE FACILITIES (CSFs)\n\nThis section describes the basic technical requirements that a CSF shall meet to\nbe considered for offer, dispatch, and settlement in the New England Markets.\nCSFs shall also meet the eligibility requirements of Section III of the ISO Tariff\nand ISO Manuals to offer into the New England Markets.\n\n**A. CSF Defined**\n\n1. Each Lead MP for a CSF shall register the CSF as each of the following:\n\ndefined Generator, DARD, and ATRR.\n\n2. Except where noted, each defined Generator, DARD and ATRR\n\nassociated with a CSF shall meet the requirements of this OP.\n\n3. The Lead MP for the CSF shall submit a bid for the defined Generator,\n\nDARD, and ATRR associated with the defined CSF.\n\n4. ISO shall only perform settlement functions for defined Generators,\n\nDARDs, and ATRRs associated with the defined CSF.\n\n5.

Each CSF shall have a single DE, which shall provide dispatch services\n\nfrom a single physical location for a defined CSF and shall be the single\npoint of contact to receive and implement ISO Dispatch Instructions and\nrelated communications. If prior approval from the ISO control room has\nbeen obtained, the operation from a single physical location allows for\nexigent conditions, as well as for infrequent, periodic testing and training\nneeds.\n\n         - **No entity shall be recognized as a DE unless the entity meets the**\n\nrequirements in this OP and has been registered pursuant to M-RPA.\n\n         - All DE contact information shall be confirmed and/or updated by the\n\nDE on an annual basis or upon change.\n\n2. Each DE shall comply with all requirements of the ISO Operating\n\nDocuments to the same extent as if the Lead MP were carrying out the\nfunctions of the DE.\n\n3. ISO shall communicate with the DE via electronic dispatch through an ISO\n\nconnected RTU or voice communications through an automatic ringdown\ntelephone circuit or one of the dedicated 24x7 phone numbers identified\nduring DE registration in accordance with M-RPA.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. The DE shall have the knowledge and authority to act on ISO Dispatch\n\nInstructions for all ISO registered assets it manages for dispatch.\n\na. Any control equipment used to start, stop or vary the output of the\n\nCSF, from a remote location, shall meet the speed, accuracy and data\nchannel requirements set in OP-18. Such equipment shall be\nmaintained by the Lead MP as required in OP-18 and ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 2 - Maintenance of\nCommunications, Computers, Metering and Computer Support\nEquipment (OP-2). ISO System Operators[11 ]shall be notified as soon\nas practicable if the equipment is incapable of meeting the\nrequirements of OP-18. Steps shall be taken by the DE to restore the\nequipment to normal operating conditions as soon as possible in\naccordance with OP-2.\n\nb. Each DE shall have, to the fullest extent possible, a dedicated voice\n\ncommunication landline telephone system with an assigned public\nswitched network landline phone number) for ISO dispatching\npurposes. If the DE cannot procure a landline telephone system, then\nan alternate or diverse method of communications, such as a cellular\ntelephone line with an assigned cellular telephone number, shall be\nprovided, unless ISO agrees otherwise on a case-by-case basis.\n\n5. In addition to the dedicated voice communication telephone, each DE shall\n\nhave a dedicated automatic ringdown telephone circuit to the ISO control\nroom for any of the following unless ISO otherwise agrees on a case-bycase basis.\n\n       - Each DE managed CSF, or combination of individual CSFs which in\n\ntotal have a capability greater than or equal to fifty (50) MW (net)\n\n       - Other instances as determined on a case-by-case basis by ISO\n\n6. Each DE for a CSF that participates in the New England Markets shall\n\nhave equipment capable of reliably receiving Dispatch Instructions sent\nelectronically by ISO as frequently as necessary and to implement\nDispatch Instructions in a timely manner as required by ISO Manuals and\nAdministrative Procedures.\n\n7. Each DE shall display to their DE Operator, the following parameters for\n\neach CSF, as defined pursuant to Sections II.A.12, III.A.4, and IV.A.6 of\nthis OP, in New England that is under its responsibility.\n\n       - setpoint\n\n       - actual injection / consumption\n\n       - Real Time High Operating Limit\n\n11 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Economic Maximum Limit\n\n   - economic dispatch limit (EDL)\n\n   - Maximum Consumption Limit\n\n   - generator response rate\n\n   - DARD response rate\n\n   - ATRR response rate\n\n   - Regulation High Limit\n\n   - Regulation Low Limit\n\n   - unit control mode\n\n   - ATRR availability\n\n    - on regulation status\n\n   - heartbeat\n\n8.

In instances where an ISO System Operator issues a verbal Dispatch\n\nInstruction or any other verbal communication, the verbal communication\nshall take precedence over all other forms of communication.\n\n**C. Dispatch Instructions**\n\n1. The DE shall follow all Dispatch Instructions in accordance with Offer Data\n\nwithout delay.\n\n2. If a DE is not capable of controlling the delivery of energy in accordance\n\nwith its Offer Data, the DE shall notify the ISO System Operators as soon\nas practicable. Efforts shall be made by the Lead MP to forecast CSF\ncapabilities based on daily local conditions and submit those parameters\nappropriately.\n\n3. ISO shall transmit Dispatch Instructions (in the form of a MW setpoint) to\n\neach DE every four seconds or less.\n\n**D. Additional Requirements for CSFs**\n\n1. Due to the unique nature and operating parameters associated with\n\nstoring energy, additional reliability data is required for these resources.\nOP-14I details the criteria and requirements for CSFs that Lead MPs shall\n\n\n-----\n\ncomply with for interconnected operation. These requirements shall be in\neffect upon installation of the communications equipment necessary to\nperform the data transfer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## VIII. AUDITING AND TESTING\n\nISO reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits or tests of a DE,\nGenerator, ATRR, DARD, DDE or DRR, to verify its compliance with the\ntechnical requirements as set forth in this OP and in accordance with Section\nIII of the ISO Tariff. These audits may be conducted on a periodic basis or\nbecause ISO has a reason to suspect a deficiency. Onsite audits will be\ncoordinated with the Lead MP, DE, or DDE (as appropriate) and scheduled\nduring normal business hours.\n\nFailure to comply with the technical requirements of this OP may cause the\nresource to be unable to perform in the New England Markets. This does\n**not include compliance failures due to circumstances beyond the reasonable**\ncontrol of the Lead MP, such as transmission, distribution or communications\noutages. ISO will determine the Generator, ATRR, DARD, or DRR ability to\nperform in the New England Markets when not in compliance with the\nrequirements of this OP. Failure to perform in the New England Markets is\nsanctionable behavior, and subject to treatment under Section III of the ISO\nTariff.\n\n**A.** **Revenue Metering**\n\n1. ISO has the right to audit testing and calibration records, and order\n\nand witness the testing of revenue metering per OP-18. In the event\nthat ISO-ordered testing results in metering tests occurring more\nfrequently than once in a twelve (12) month period, ISO would pay for\nthe reasonable expense of the extra meter testing only in the event\nthat the metering system is found to be fully functional and in\ncalibration per OP-18. When tested otherwise, the Lead MP will be\nresponsible for the expenses of the extra meter testing.\n\n**B.** **Equipment Maintenance**\n\n1. Each Lead MP shall keep detailed records of equipment maintenance.\n\nISO shall have the right to review the maintenance and test record for\nauditing purposes to ensure that the equipment (AVR, governor,\nstabilizer equipment, telemetering and communication and control\nequipment) is maintained in good operating condition.\n\n**C.** **Protection Systems**\n\n1. ISO shall have the right to review protection studies, elementary\n\ndiagrams, relay setting documents, relay maintenance reports and\nrelay calibration records in order to audit compliance with the\nprotection criteria of NPCC and ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IX. FORMS ADMINISTRATION\n\nISO Forms NX-12, 12E and 12G reside in the appendices to this OP. Each\nappendix also contains an explanation of terms and instructions for data\npreparation of the specific form. ISO staff will review the forms for completeness,\nand assign a data revision number to the form if required. System Operations &\nMarket Administration - Asset Registration & Auditing shall also route completed\nforms NX-12, 12E and 12G to the ISO Power System Modeling Management\ngroup for changes to the EMS. If additional or missing information is required,\nthe ISO staff will contact the person who prepared the form to obtain the\nnecessary information. When ISO has determined the forms to be complete and\naccurate, the forms will be routed to the appropriate ISO departments.\n\n\n-----\n\n## X.

It\nincludes general actions to control voltage/reactive conditions when deviations from normal\nconditions occur, or are needed, to minimize adverse effects during abnormal conditions.\n\nSpecific criteria and actions are contained in detailed voltage/reactive documents issued as\npart of the ISO New England (ISO) Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs). Temporary\ntransmission operating guides (TGs) may contain additional criteria and actions required to\ncorrect abnormal voltage/reactive conditions. Permanent TOGs and TGs are published in\nthe Operations Documents Management System (ODMS); all are classified under\nAttachment D - ISO New England Information Policy to the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff, as Confidential and Critical Energy\nInfrastructure Information (CEII) documents and are not publically available.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **CRITERIA**\n\n**A. Voltage Schedules and Limits for Transmission Equipment and Generators**\n\nVoltage schedules and limits for transmission equipment and NERC registered and/or\ntransmission connected (69 kV or higher) Generators that can control transmission\nvoltage are specified by ISO in Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules (OP-12B) of\nthis OP. The majority of the information in OP-12B is sourced from the NX database.\n\nAs described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical\nRequirements for Generators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands\nand Alternative Technology Regulation Resources (OP-14), Generators are required to\nsubmit Form NX-12D. As described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 –\nTransmission System Data (OP-16), Transmission Owners (TOs) are required to submit\nForm NX-9 for transmission equipment. Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources\nare also required to submit Form NX-12D.\n\nOP-12B includes schedules and device information for:\n```\n        o Transmission-connected Generators, which includes but is not limited to:\n\n```\n            - Multi-machine Synchronous Generator Plants\n\n             - Solar Photovoltaic Generation Plants\n\n            - Wind Turbine Generation Plants\n\n             - Fuel Cell Plants\n```\n        o Transmission-connected Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources,\n\n```\nwhich includes but is not limited to:\n\n           - Transmission Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs)\n\n            - Transmission Static VAR Compensators\n\n           - Synchronous Condensers\n\nFor the above devices, OP-12B reports voltage schedules and device\nparameters as approved in Form NX-12D. Reactive capabilities shall\nrepresent test data. If test data is not available, theoretical values may be\nused.\n\nOP-12B also includes information for:\n\n      - Autotransformers with Load Tap Changers (LTCs) – OP-12B reports voltage\n\nschedules and device parameters as approved in Form NX-9B.\n\n      - Transmission Capacitors – OP-12B reports device parameters as approved in\n\nForm NX-9D.\n\n      - Transmission Reactors – OP-12B reports device parameters as approved in Form\n\nNX-9D and Form NX-9G.\n\n\n-----\n\nOP-12B classifies the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources\nbased on voltage control:\n\n  - Part of the Form NX-12D describes the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic\n\nReactive Resources capability to control voltage. A Generator or Non-Generator\nDynamic Reactive Resources voltage control capability is described by one of\nthese three categories:\n\n  - Option A – These Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources\n\ndirectly regulate transmission system voltage (69kV and above) to a schedule.\nThese Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources are listed\nin OP-12B\n\n`o` Newly-interconnecting transmission-connected Generators (and Gen\n\ninstalled reactive devices) and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive\nResources must have a voltage control system that directly regulates a\ntransmission bus to a voltage schedule. Transmission voltage schedules\nwill be provided in OP-12B and are adjustable in real-time by the LCC /\nISO. Plant terminal voltage(s) and/or reactive power output(s) must adjust\nautomatically, without a human in the loop, to adhere to the plants\ntransmission voltage schedule.\n\nTransmission-connected Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic\nReactive Resources are those whose Point Of Interconnection (POI)\nis 69 kV and above, as described in their S/LGIA.\n\nBy exception, if a documented technical rationale demonstrates that\nan alternate voltage control strategy not involving direct regulation of\na transmission bus is warranted on an engineering basis (for\nexample, as an outcome of the System Impact Study), such a\ntransmission-connected Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic\nReactive Resource would not be considered Option A.\n\n`o` Existing Option A Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive\n\nResources may utilize human operator intervention to regulate a\ntransmission bus to a voltage schedule. For example, an existing unit\n(without an automatic outer loop control system) where the plant operator\nprovides the outer loop control function by manually adjusting a terminal\nvoltage control set point to achieve transmission system voltage\nregulation to its OP-12B schedule will remain an Option A unit.\n\nIf such an existing Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive\nResource undergoes a reactive power control system replacement\n(e.g. excitation system upgrade), the Generator or Non-Generator\nDynamic Reactive Resource shall meet the requirement described in\ni. for automatic outer loop direct transmission bus voltage regulation.\n\n`o` Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources are\n\nconsidered to be interconnecting at transmission voltage levels if they are\ndirectly stepping up (or down), via transformation, from their local voltage\ninto a transmission station.\n\n\n-----\n\nTransmission voltage schedules are not specified for Generator and NonGenerator Dynamic Reactive devices not modeled in the ISO Energy\nManagement System (EMS) Network Database.\n\n  -  Option B – These Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources\n\nregulate voltage at a bus below that of a transmission voltage level (less than 69\nkV). They may follow local voltage schedules specified by the low voltage facility\nowner in accordance with LCC requirements or as required in their\nInterconnection Agreements.\n\n`o` At the discretion of ISO in coordination with the LCC, a transmission\nconnected Option B unit may warrant inclusion in OP-12B, listing the nontransmission voltage schedule.\n\n  -  Option C – These Generators are exempt from the requirement to have an\n\nautomatic voltage regulator (AVR). These Generators are listed in M/LCC 8A.\nAs noted in M/LCC 8A, these Generators commonly follow a reactive power\nschedule by operating with a constant power factor as specified in their\nInterconnection Agreements.\n\nOP-12B contains voltage schedules for all Generators and Non-Generator Dynamic\nReactive Resources that are Option A, which are Generators and Non-Generator\nDynamic Reactive Resources that regulate transmission voltage. OP-12B also may\ninclude certain transmission-connected Option B Generators and Non-Generator\nDynamic Reactive Resources at the discretion of ISO in coordination with the LCC.\n\nThe voltage schedule specified for a Generator in OP-12B is the prescribed normal\nvoltage that a Generator shall maintain. This normal voltage schedule is represented by\na kV schedule value with accompanying operational kV high and kV low values that\nestablish the “voltage schedule tolerance band.”\n\nCurrently, the normal voltage schedule is indicated in the “On Peak Period” fields, and if\napplicable, an alternate schedule is indicated in the “Off Peak Period” fields. A\nGenerator shall maintain voltage output within its normal voltage schedule tolerance\nband values in system operations at all times while one or more units at the generating\nstation are online, unless otherwise directed by ISO or the LCC. These voltage\nschedules shall also be used by operators and planners in off-line studies of the power\nsystem.\n\nDuring certain infrequent, atypical conditions at a generating station or on the power\nsystem, ISO or an LCC may issue an Operating Instruction to a Generator or NonGenerator Reactive Resource to deviate from its normal voltage schedule and to\ntemporarily operate at a voltage output level outside of the normal voltage schedule\ntolerance band, but within the wider minimum and maximum “acceptable” voltage\nschedule range, which is also listed in OP-12B. Note this operation may need to be\nexamined by engineering to determine if operation at this temporary voltage schedule\nimpacts stability limits for the unit or system.\n\nDuring these conditions, if ISO or the LCC issue an Operating Instruction to a\ngenerating station to operate to a temporary voltage schedule, ISO or the LCC shall\nprovide each applicable generating station operator with the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n   - The temporary voltage schedule to be maintained with the AVR in-service and\n\ncontrolling to a voltage setpoint\n\n   - The temporary voltage schedule tolerance band to be maintained\n\n    - The expected duration of this temporary voltage schedule change (if known, or\n\n“until further notice”)\n\nDuring normal operations on the power system, the ISO or an LCC may issue an\nOperating Instruction to a Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource to\nadjust their voltage setpoint while remaining within the normal voltage schedule\ntolerance band. Adjustments such as these are not considered a change to the OP-12B\nlisted voltage schedule provided the setpoint remains within the original tolerance band.\n\nIf the generating station operator has been directed to deviate from the normal voltage\nschedule and tolerance band, the LCC shall contact the generating station operator at\nleast once per shift to confirm the temporary voltage schedule and tolerance band.\nOnce the temporary voltage schedule is no longer applicable, the ISO or LCC shall\nissue an Operating Instruction to the generating station operator to return to the normal\nvoltage schedule and tolerance band.\n\n**B. Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources Reactive Capabilities,**\n\n**Commitments and Required Reactive Reserves**\n\nGenerators’ and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ reactive capabilities\nentered in the NX-12D Forms shall be used in system operations and analyses. Each\nGenerator’s and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ reactive capability shall\nbe fully available when the Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource\nis on-line and any change to the Generator or Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive\nResource reactive capability shall be reported to the ISO and LCC in Real-Time in\naccordance with Appendix B to OP-14 (OP-14B).\n\nTo reflect Generators’ and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resources’ updated\nreactive capabilities, and to capture any voltage schedule or equipment parameter\nchanges, OP-12B will be updated as needed, using the NX database as its source.\n\nTo promote security of the transmission system during adverse voltage/reactive\nconditions, required Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource\ncommitments and levels of required reactive reserve from Generators and NonGenerator Dynamic Reactive Resources within certain areas of the New England\nReliability Coordinator Area (RCA) have been established. System conditions that\nwarrant the prescribed Generator and Non-Generator Dynamic Reactive Resource\ncommitments or reactive reserves have also been identified. As applicable, details are\ncontained in the TOGs and TGs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **VOLTAGE/REACTIVE OPERATING PRACTICES**\n\n**A. Traditional Voltage/Reactive Control**\n\nDispatch of shunt capacitors/reactors combined with effective transformer voltage\nschedules or fixed tap settings are the most traditional means of achieving desired\nvoltages and reactive conditions while maintaining dynamic reactive reserve on\nGenerators. Switchable shunt devices installed to support the New England\nTransmission System (115 kV and above) and guides for switching them can be found\nin OP-12B and in the TOGs.\n\n**B. Transmission Interface Transfer Limits to Avoid Low Voltage**\n\nIn some cases, custom software tools have been developed to calculate voltage-based\ntransfer limits for transmission interfaces. These limits provide acceptable voltage\nresponse to contingencies. As applicable, details are contained in the TOGs and TGs.\n\n**C. Circuit Switching to Control High Voltage**\n\nIn some areas, transmission circuit switching is a viable option for controlling high\nvoltage/excessive charging conditions. As applicable, details are contained in the TOGs\nand TGs\n\n**D. Load Management for Voltage/Reactive Reliability**\n\nIn severe cases of low voltage and/or inadequate reactive reserves, load management\nactions may be taken. Details on conditions when these actions may/shall be used and\nhow they shall be implemented are described in the TOGs and ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4) and ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7).\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV. RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nThis OP is based on the principle that voltage control is best achieved when action is taken\nas close as possible to the affected area. Voltage schedules and other reactive conditions\nshall be supervised by the generating station operators, transmission station operators,\nLCC System Operators and ISO System Operators, each having a specific area of\nresponsibility. Regardless of who issues an Operating Instruction for a corrective measure\n(ISO or LCC, respectively), action shall ultimately be taken by a generating/transmission\nstation operator or LCC System Operator depending on who has \"hands on\" control of the\nreactive resource.\n\n**A. Generating and Transmission Stations**\n\n**1. Generating Station and Transmission Station Operation to Maintain Voltage**\n\n**Schedule**\n\nGenerating station operators and transmission station operators are responsible for\nmaintaining station service and other local voltage requirements and scheduled\nvoltages at levels designated by ISO in OP-12B, or as otherwise specified through an\nOperating Instruction issued by ISO or an LCC.\n\nTransmission station operators with control over dynamic reactive resources\nmaintaining a voltage schedule within a voltage schedule tolerance band outlined in\nOP-12B shall comply with the requirements for generating station operators\noutlined in this Section IV.A.1.\n\nAutomatic voltage regulation normally works off the low-side of the step-up\ntransformer (generator terminals). In order to maintain a high-side voltage schedule,\nmanual intervention may be required to offset varying power flows through and\nvoltage drops across the step-up transformer.\n\nThe generating station operator shall maintain the high-side bus voltage within the\nnormal voltage schedule tolerance band, as specified in the “kV High” and “kV Low”\nlevels for the appropriate load period and indicated in the “Operational Voltage\nSchedules” columns of OP-12B. If a Generator does not have high-side bus voltage\nvisibility (visibility of the bus voltage that is of the same voltage class as its schedule),\na description of the method used to derive its GSU low-side schedule to achieve the\nassigned voltage schedule shall be included in the unit’s NX-12D Form in accordance\nwith OP-14B.\n\nOperation outside of the prescribed normal voltage schedule tolerance band shall\nbe kept to a minimum. The generating station operator shall regularly check\nGenerator high-side bus voltage against scheduled voltage and if the high-side\nvoltage is outside the voltage schedule tolerance band, act to reestablish voltage\nwithin the tolerance band within 15 minutes. When a generating station operator or\ntransmission station operator is unable to maintain the scheduled voltage within the\nvoltage schedule tolerance band and local voltages with the means under its\ncontrol, the generating station operator or transmission station operator shall notify\nits respective LCC System Operator (and local dispatch authority if appropriate). If a\nGenerator’s high-side bus voltage drifts outside of its normal voltage schedule\ntolerance band, the generating station operator shall immediately notify the LCC\n\n\n-----\n\nwhen one of the following conditions is met:\n\n(1) The Generator has been operating outside of its prescribed voltage\n\nschedule tolerance band for a continuous period of 15 minutes; or\n\n(2) The generating station operator determines that the Generator will be\n\nunable to return to operating within its prescribed voltage schedule\ntolerance band within 15 minutes\n\nA unit is not allowed to operate outside its normal voltage schedule tolerance band\nunless ISO or the LCC issues an Operating Instruction to do so. If a unit is not\nmaintaining its voltage within the prescribed normal voltage schedule tolerance band\nfor a period exceeding 15 minutes and has not notified the LCC (as described\nabove), or is not closely following an alternative voltage schedule issued by ISO or\nthe LCC, then the unit shall be considered to be in violation of this OP.\n\nWhen a Generator is issued an Operating Instruction to deviate from its normal\nvoltage schedule and tolerance band, the Generator shall operate within this\ntemporary voltage schedule tolerance band until further notice.\n\n**2. Generator Operation in Automatic Voltage Control Mode**\n\nNERC Reliability Standard VAR-002 - Generator Operation for Maintaining Network\nVoltage Schedules requires each Generator equipped with an AVR to operate in\nthe automatic voltage control mode. Whenever the AVR operation is available, the\nGenerator AVR shall:\n\n    - Be in-service and controlling voltage, and\n\n   - Remain in this configuration unless otherwise directed by the ISO or LCC\n\nSystem Operator.\n\nIn ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 18 – Metering and Telemetering\nCriteria (OP-18), ISO-NE requires each Generator modeled in the ISO EMS\nNetwork Database to provide telemetry indicating its AVR’s status. Generators\nexempted from operating with their AVR in the voltage control mode will be\ndocumented in M/LCC 8A and will not be required to provide AVR status telemetry.\nThe ISO may require AVR status for a Generator that has an operational impact but\nis not modeled in the ISO EMS Network Database.\n\nWhen a Generator AVR is out-of-service, the generating station operator shall use\nan alternative method to control the Generator reactive output to meet the voltage\nor Reactive Power schedule. Actual or expected changes in AVR operating status\nshall be reported in accordance with this OP and with M/LCC 8 as follows:\n\n   - The generating station operator shall report changes to AVR status in Real\nTime except for conditions that the Lead Market Participant (Lead MP) has\nreported in advance on Form NX-12D, as described in the following\nparagraph. The Generator shall make those reports whenever the AVR is\nremoved from or placed in-service unless taking those actions is warranted by\nemergency plant conditions. The generating station operator shall also report\nany problems that could interfere with proper operation of an AVR. These\nreports shall be made to the following entities as soon as the AVR status\n\n\n-----\n\nchange condition arises, as follows:\n```\n       o The generating station operator shall report to the applicable LCC; and\n       o The Lead MP shall report to ISO through its assigned Designated Entity\n\n```\n(DE)\n\n     - When the Lead MP describes expected changes to AVR status that occur\n\nduring Real-Time conditions on Form NX-12D for the Generator in\naccordance with ISO OP-14 (i.e. periods of time when the Lead MP routinely\nexpects that its Generator will not operate with the AVR in-service and\ncontrolling voltage, such as during start-up or shut-down) these changes shall\n**not to be reported in Real-Time. When conditions that match the conditions**\ndescribed on Form NX-12D occur, the information on Form NX-12D shall\nserve as advance standing notification and Real-Time reporting shall not be\nrequired.\n\n**3. Generator Verification of Reactive Capability**\n\nEach generating station operator is responsible to comply with the reactive capability\nverification process detailed in ISO New England Operating Procedure No.23 Resource Auditing (OP-23).\n\n**B. LCCs**\n\nEach LCC is responsible for monitoring the following:\n\n(1) Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and static VAR compensator\n\nvoltage schedules, limits and AVR status.\n\n(2) Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and static VAR compensator\n\nMVAr loadings, capabilities and reserves.\n\n(3) Transformer voltage schedules.\n\n(4) MVAr flows between the AC system and HVDC facilities.\n\n(5) Other predefined indicators of voltage/reactive security (e.g., a particular circuit\n\nflow, the status of specific Generators, area load level, etc.).\n\nThe LCCs are responsible for:\n\n(1) Dispatching shunt capacitors and reactors.\n\n(2) Implementing transformer fixed and seasonal tap settings.\n\n(3) Line switching for voltage/reactive control (which shall be coordinated with ISO\n\nand, if warranted, with other LCCs).\n\n(4) Detecting and correcting deviations from the voltage schedule tolerance band\n\non a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, and/or static VAR\ncompensator.\n\nProviding Real-time voltage setpoint changes to the operator of a Generator,\nSTATCOM, synchronous condenser or static VAR compensator to include the\n\n\n-----\n\ntemporary voltage setpoint to maintain, with AVR in-service and controlling\nvoltage.\n\n(5) Providing Real-Time voltage schedule changes to the operator of a Generator,\n\nSTATCOM, synchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator, including the\nfollowing information:\n```\n    o The temporary voltage schedule to maintain with AVR in-service and\n\n```\ncontrolling voltage.\n```\n    o The temporary voltage schedule tolerance band to maintain.\n    o The expected duration of this temporary voltage schedule change.\n\n```\n(6) Contacting the operator of a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser,\n\nor static VAR compensator that has been directed to deviate from the normal\nvoltage schedule and tolerance band at least once per shift, to confirm the\ntemporary voltage schedule and tolerance band.\n\n(7) Directing the operator of a Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, or\n\nstatic VAR compensator to return to the normal voltage schedule and\ntolerance band once the temporary voltage schedule is no longer applicable.\n\n(8) Responding to notifications from the operator of a Generator, STATCOM,\n\nsynchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator of their difficulty in\nmaintaining station or other local voltage or reactive schedules.\n\n(9) Responding to ISO requests to assist with inter-LCC or inter-area problems.\n\n(10) Notifying/coordinating with ISO when there is a need to adjust the real power\n\n(MW) output of a Generator in order to adjust its MVAr output. ISO shall\nprovide the direction to the DE to adjust its Generator real power (MW) output.\nUnless an emergency condition warrants such action, the LCCs shall not\ndirectly issue an Operating Instruction to the generating station operator to\nadjust the real power output (MW) of its Generator in order to adjust its MVAr\noutput.\n\n(11) Notifying/coordinating with ISO, any of the following voltage/reactive control\n\nactions prior to implementation:\n```\n    o Line switching.\n    o Load management in response to voltage SOL exceedance/violation.\n    o Generator, STATCOM, synchronous condenser, or static VAR compensator\n\n```\nvoltage schedule tolerance band (kV high and/or kV low) changes.\n\nIf ISO and an LCC differ on what the voltage schedule should be for a given unit, then\nISO and that LCC shall discuss and agree upon the appropriate voltage schedule to be\ncommunicated to the unit.\n\nWhen an LCC is unable to correct a voltage/reactive problem using all available\nactions or the LCC believes that the problem should be handled on a multi-LCC or\ninter-RCA basis, the LCC shall notify ISO and request assistance.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo verify a Generator’s voltage control capability, each LCC shall use the template\nprovided in OP-12, Appendix D - Voltage Schedule Annual Transmittal Form (OP-12D).\nDuring the first quarter of each year, each LCC shall email the OP-12D transmittal form\nto each Option A or Option B Generator within its operational footprint that is\nrepresented in the ISO EMS. The OP-12D transmittal form shall be sent to the Lead\nMP for that Generator.\n\nAs the source of email addresses for the Lead MPs, each LCC shall use the DE\nContact Information posted on the confidential satellite information website at:\n\n[https://smd.iso-ne.com/satellite/nx12_initialdisplay/](https://smd.iso-ne.com/satellite/nx12_initialdisplay/)\n\nOn each such transmittal, the LCC shall copy the Chair of the Voltage Task Force at\nemail address:\n\n[vtfcontact@iso-ne.com](mailto:vtfcontact@iso-ne.com)\n\n**C. ISO**\n\nISO is responsible for;\n\n(1) General monitoring and supervision of voltage/reactive conditions in the New\nEngland RCA (115 kV and above). When system monitoring detects a problem\nwithin an LCC, ISO shall contact the LCC and request action.\n\n(2) Notifying the applicable LCC as soon as it becomes aware of an emergency or\nforced outage of a Generator AVR.\n\n      - When an LCC reports to ISO that it is not possible to correct an abnormal\n\nvoltage/reactive-related operating condition at a station or an LCC level,\nISO shall assume direct responsibility for alleviating the problem. ISO shall\ndirect, through the appropriate LCC(s), all actions listed in the above LCC\nSection IV. B of this OP as well as any MW re-dispatching.\n\n      - If ISO and an LCC differ on what the voltage schedule should be for a\n\ngiven unit, then ISO and that LCC shall discuss and agree upon the\nappropriate voltage schedule to be communicated to the unit.\n\n(3) Monitoring and supervising voltage/reactive operations of inter-RCA ties.\nAbnormal voltage/reactive-related operating conditions may be noticed by ISO\nor appear in the form of requests from a neighboring Reliability Coordinator or\nentities for assistance. ISO shall inform the appropriate LCC(s) of the nature of\nthe problem specifying; the pool or entity involved, the location of the\nundesirable voltage/reactive condition and general conditions aggravating the\ndifficulty. ISO may work with/through the LCCs and use all actions under\nSection IV. B of this OP as well as MW re-dispatching to eliminate the\nproblem.\n\n      - When abnormal voltage/reactive operating conditions materialize, ISO may\n\ninitiate a survey of key system parameters to better assess the nature and\nexpanse of the conditions. Online tools are used to conduct the surveys.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OP-12 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the RTO**\nOperations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

Introduction\n\nThis Appendix F describes Wind Plant operating requirements and the data reporting\nrequirements that Wind Plant Operators shall submit to ISO New England (ISO).\nThe submittal of such data supports the operation of a centralized regional wind\npower forecasting system and therefore, the reliable and efficient integration of wind\npower into the ISO New England Balancing Authority Area (ISO-NE BAA). The\nrequirements stated in this Appendix F apply to all Wind Plants that will be or are\ndispatched by ISO and represented in the ISO Energy Management System (EMS).\nIncluded also are requirements for data that will be integrated into the ISO EMS in\norder to facilitate operator system awareness and allow for the utilization of\nautomated dispatch for wind Generator Assets[1].\n\n## 2. Definitions\n\nBelow are definitions of relevant terms in this Appendix F:\n\n**_Curtailment or Curtailed – Wind Plant Operator action (whether manual,_**\nscheduled, or automatic), resulting from an ISO Dispatch Instruction, that limits the\namount of power produced by wind turbine(s) within a Wind Plant to below the\nmaximum amount of power that could be produced by the normally operating\navailable equipment given the current weather conditions at the wind turbine and/or\nWind Plant.\n\n**_Met Gathering Station – a permanent purpose-built and/or sited station dedicated to_**\nthe collection of Meteorological Data.\n\n**_Meteorological Data– The real-time data (e.g., wind speeds and directions)_**\ncollected at a specific Wind Plant’s location.\n\n**_Plant Wind Directions (nacelle-level) – The instantaneous wind direction and_**\ncalibrated for True North equal to 0 degrees.\n\n**_Plant Wind Speeds (nacelle-level) – The instantaneous wind speeds measured by_**\nwind measuring equipment (e.g. anemometry).\n\n**_Real Time High Operating Limit – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE_**\nTransmission Markets and Services Tariff (“Tariff”)[2].\n\n**_Wind High Limit – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets, and_**\nServices Tariff (“Tariff”).\n\n**_Wind Plant – For the purpose of this Appendix F, a Wind Plant is a collection of one_**\nor more wind turbine generators and the additional equipment required to\ninterconnect these wind turbines into the electrical power system, consistent with the\n\n1 Note that this Appendix F discusses Wind Plant data reporting and operating requirements. To the extent that\n\nthere are other operating, transmission service and market requirements applicable to Wind Plants, the Wind Plant\nOperator must refer to and comply with the applicable ISO New England Operating Documents.\n\n2 ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, & Services Tariff Section I, General Terms and Conditions (Tariff):\n\nhttp://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/regulatory/tariff/sect_1/sect_i.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\ndefinition of a Generator Asset stated in Section I of the Tariff. A Wind Plant shall be\ncomprised of one or more Wind Turbine Groups.\n\n**_Wind Plant Future Availability (WPFA) – Is defined in Section I of the ISO-NE_**\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (“Tariff”).\n\n**_Wind Plant Operator – for the purposes of this Appendix F, is the Lead Market_**\nParticipant (Lead MP), or its designee, who operates a Wind Plant and/or reports the\ndata to ISO as required in this Appendix F, as applicable.\n\n**_Wind Turbine Counts: - shall include the following 4 (four) values (see Figure 1_**\nbelow for a visual representation of the definitions):\n\n**_Wind Turbines Curtailed – is the total number of wind turbines in the Wind Plant_**\nthat are Curtailed.\n\n**_Wind Turbines Out-of-Service – is the total number of wind turbines at a Wind_**\nPlant that are out-of-service for any reason.\n\n**_Wind Turbines Operating Normally – is the total number of wind turbines at a_**\nWind Plant that are operating normally (i.e., not out-of-service and not Curtailed)\nregardless of whether or not those wind turbines are generating real power (MW).\n\n**_Wind Turbines Generating Power – is the total number of wind turbines at a_**\nWind Plant that are generating real power (MW) at any level regardless of\nwhether or not those wind turbines are limited due to Curtailments.\n\n**Figure 1 - Wind Turbine Counts**\n\n**_Wind Turbine Group – is a group of wind turbine generators within the Wind Plant_**\nwhere all wind turbines generators are within a 10 (plant wide average) rotor\ndiameter radius from the nearest neighboring wind turbine generator. One or more\nWind Turbine Groups shall comprise a Wind Plant. See Attachment A - Wind\nTurbine Groups of this Appendix F for examples of Wind Turbine Group\nconfigurations.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n## 3. Standard Operational Practice and Requirements\n\n**3.1 Wind Plant Data**\n\nUnless other modeling and data arrangements are agreed upon by ISO, Wind Plant\ndata (whether static or telemetered) that is submitted by a Wind Plant Operator in\naccordance with this Appendix F shall be consistent with the definition of Wind\nPlant.\n\n**3.2 Reclosing and Restarts**\n\nA Wind Plant shall be designed and operated (including the performance of\nreclosings and restarts) by the Wind Plant Operator in accordance with ISO New\nEngland Operating Documents, which apply to all generating unit Resources\nwithin the ISO-NE BAA.\n\nIf the Wind Plant main breaker is opened (i.e., the plant is manually or\nautomatically disconnected from the rest of the New England Transmission\nSystem) the Wind Plant Operator must receive permission from ISO and the LCC\nprior to reclosing (i.e., reconnect to the New England Transmission System). In\nother words, an automatic restart of the Wind Plant is not permitted following a\nfault to the Distribution System or Transmission System that is severe enough to\ndisconnect the Wind Plant [e.g., an Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) event that\nis not “ridden through”] or following any Wind Plant-wide out-of-service event.\n\nThe automatic restart of a Wind Plant following high wind speed cut-out events is\nallowed.\n\n**3.3 Ramp Rate Limitations**\n\nDue to the very fast ramping capabilities of Wind Plants, there is potential for the\ntransmission equipment with which they are interconnected to become\nsignificantly loaded or unloaded, which may lead to operational and reliability\nconcerns, therefore ramp rate limitations have been established as described\nbelow. As operational experience is gained, ISO shall reevaluate this limit on a\nWind Plant-by-Wind Plant basis, or as it applies to all Wind Plants in New\nEngland, as warranted. Where alternative ramp rates are determined to be\nacceptable on a Wind Plant-specific basis, those plant-specific limits shall be\nprovided to the Lead MP by ISO.\n\nFor Wind Plants totaling 200 MW or less in nameplate, under all conditions except\nfor emergencies and decreasing wind conditions, a default maximum ramp rate of\n20 MW/min averaged over five minutes is not to be exceeded unless otherwise\nrequested by ISO.\n\nFor Wind Plants of greater than 200 MW in nameplate, under all conditions except\nfor emergencies and decreasing wind conditions, a default maximum ramp rate of\n10% of nameplate per minute (in MW/min) averaged over 5 (five) minutes is not\nto be exceeded unless otherwise requested by ISO; see example below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\nPlant nameplate 210 MW.\n\nLimit: no more than 21 MW per minute when averaged over five (5) minutes\n\n**Sat./** **Corr.**\n\n**Minute1** **Minute2** **Minute3** **Minute4** **Minute5** **[Average ]**\n\n**rate** **Unsat.** **Action**\n\n100 MW/ 0 MW/ 0 MW/ 0 MW/ 0 MW/ 20 MW/ Sat None\nmin min min min min min\n\n100 MW/ 10 MW/ 0 MW/ 0 MW/ 0 MW/ 22 MW/ Unsat Limit\nmin min min min min min ramp in\n\neither\n\nfirst or\n\nsecond\n\nminute\n\n**3.4 Outage Coordination**\n\nISO New England Operating Procedure No.5 - Resource Maintenance and\nOutage Scheduling (OP-5) requires a generating unit Resource to submit an\noutage request via ISO Outage Application software whenever a Resource is “out\nof service”, meaning that the Resource is not able to provide real power MW onto\nthe electrical grid. Outage requests can be for planned or unplanned outages. In\nthe case of Wind Plants, OP-5 requirements that the Wind Plant Operator submits\nadvance daily outage requests in order to perform routine maintenance work on a\nWind Plant component [i.e., individual wind turbine(s)] which may have no effect\non their overall MW capability of the Wind Plant.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1. Each Wind Plant Operator shall submit Wind Plant Future Availability to\n\nISO for each Wind Plant. The Wind Plant Future Availability shall serve\nas the Wind Plant Operator “notification” of an outage for OP-5 purposes.\n\n2. If a Wind Plant does not have a CSO and is not a Qualified Generator\n\nReactive Resource as stated above, a Wind Plant Operator must submit\nto ISO the Wind Plant Future Availability for the Wind Plant; but a Wind\nPlant Operator is not required to submit outage requests for the Wind\nPlant to ISO.\n\n3. For each Wind Plant with a CSO or that is a Qualified Generator Reactive\n\nResource, the Wind Plant Operator must submit:\n\nA. Wind Plant Future Availability to ISO for the Wind Plant; and,\n\nB. When the outage will de-rate the Wind Plant to the point that the total\n\navailable nameplate is less than its CSO or when the outage will\nreduce the available VArs to less than the Qualified VArs, submit an\n\n|Plant nameplate 210 MW.

Static Plant Data Requirements\n\nBelow are the static plant data requirements that describe the physical layout of the\nWind Plant and any associated meteorological equipment as well as data relevant to\nthe design and operation of the Wind Plant. This data must be maintained and\nsubmitted by the Wind Plant Operator to ISO on Attachment C, Wind Plant Static\nData Information Form to this Appendix F. The Wind Plant Static Data Information\nForm is an editable Excel workbook file and must be requested from, completed, and\nreturned as an Excel workbook file to the ISO at RenewableResourceInt@isone.com. A sample Attachment C is included in this Appendix F. Instructions are\nincluded on the form on how to request, complete, and submit the required\ninformation. Consistent with Schedules 22 and 23 of Section II of the Tariff and OP14, the Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the static plant data for each Wind Plant\nis kept current and changes are communicated to ISO via an Attachment C submittal\nif any data point changes in a material fashion. For example:\n\n     -  if a wind turbine in the Wind Plant is replaced with a different make or model\n\ntype, information for the new wind turbine must be supplied;\n\n     -  if the permitting requirements change, the new requirements must be\n\nspecified;\n\n     -  if wind measuring equipment is replaced with non-identical measuring\n\nequipment, the make and model information for the new equipment must be\nsupplied.\n\nStatic data:\n\n1.

Real-Time Data Collection and Transfer\n\nThis section presents the real-time operational and meteorological data requirements\nfor Wind Plant Operators. In accordance with Table 6.1 to this Appendix F, data\nrequired under this Section must be electronically and automatically transmitted by\nthe Wind Plant Operator to ISO over a secure network using the protocol approved\nby ISO. In addition, if any recommended (i.e. not required) data is provided by the\nWind Plant Operator, it must also be electronically and automatically transmitted over\na secure network using the protocol approved by ISO. Wind power forecasting\naccuracy is highly dependent on the availability of the real-time meteorological,\npower production, and status data for tuning the forecaster models. As such, this\ninformation is required with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.\n\n**5.1 Required Data Collection Points**\n\n_5.1.1 Meteorological Data_\n\nThe following Wind Plant data shall be provided by the Wind Plant Operator to ISO.\n\nAt a minimum:\n\n1. Nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements must be provided\n\nfrom the highest wind turbine (i.e., wind turbine hub elevation in terms of\nelevation above mean sea level) in each Wind Turbine Group within the Wind\nPlant\n\n2. Nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements must be provided\n\nfrom one wind turbine at the maximal value of each of the four true cardinal\ndirections (i.e., the farthest true North, South, East, and West) in each Wind\nTurbine Group within the Wind Plant.\n\n3. The wind turbine nearest the capacity-weighted centroid of the Wind Plant\n\nmust also report nacelle-level wind speed and wind direction measurements.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n4. Ambient air temperature, ambient air pressure, and ambient air relative\n\nhumidity must be measured, at a minimum, at one location within the Wind\nPlant (preferably as near to the capacity-weighted centroid of the Wind Plant\nas possible) whose height above ground may be in the range of 2 m to 10 m\n(or up to 50 m above mean sea level for offshore Wind Plants) and the\nmeasurement height above ground (or mean sea level for offshore Wind\nPlants) must be stated to within 10 cm\n\nIf any wind turbine within a Wind Turbine Group satisfies more than one of the data\npoints required in items 1-4 above, then it may be used to fulfill all conditions that it\nsatisfies (e.g., if the highest wind turbine in a Wind Turbine Group is also the farthest\nNorth and the farthest East, it may be used to supply data for all three of these\ncategories). Where more than one turbine satisfies these conditions, preference\nshould be given to those turbines that will be least affected by Wind Plant (or Wind\nTurbine Group) wake effect from the prevailing wind direction(s). Finally, where a\nWind Turbine Group contains 10 or fewer wind turbines only the nacelle-level data\nfrom the highest wind turbine nacelle is required. The locations of wind turbines with\nnacelle-level equipment providing data must be referenced to the static plant data\nsupplied locations identified in Section 4 above.\n\nThe Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the number of nacelle specific sensors\nproviding wind direction data at the Wind Plant meets or exceeds the requirements\nabove and that each sensor measures with minimum resolution to 1 degree and with\nminimum accuracy to +/- 5 degrees.\n\nThe Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the Plant Wind Directions are determined\nby either:\n\n    -  Wind measuring equipment (e.g., wind vane) that is mounted in, on, or nearby\n\nthe nacelle/rotor assembly with reasonable attempt to minimize the effects of\nrotor “prop-wash” or obstruction or\n\n    -  Wind turbine nacelle yaw, corrected at all times to report wind direction\n\nbetween 0 degrees and 359.9 degrees\n\nThe Wind Plant Operator shall verify that the number of nacelle specific sensors\nproviding wind speed data at a Wind Plant meets or exceeds the requirements\nabove. Wind speed measuring equipment must measure with minimum resolution to\n0.1 m/s and must possess minimum accuracy of within 0.5 m/s over the range of 0\nm/s to rated plus 1 m/s, and within 5% of reading above this range up to the highest\ncut-out wind speed (e.g., the cut-out wind speed for a short term gust) plus 5 m/s.\nFor example if a wind turbine has cut-in, rated, and highest cut-out wind speeds of 3\nm/s, 12 m/s, and 30 m/s, the wind speed measuring equipment on the nacelle must\nhave accuracy to within 0.5 m/s within the range of 0 m/s to 13 m/s, and within 5% of\nreading over the range of 13 m/s to 35 m/s.\n\n_5.1.2 Wind High Limit_\n\nThe Wind High Limit of a Wind Plant should be calculated as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\nWhen a Wind Plant is not being Curtailed, its Wind High Limit shall be calculated to\nbe equal to the net generation.\n\nWhen a Wind Plant is being Curtailed, its Wind High Limit shall be calculated to\nequal the Wind Plant’s possible power production given current wind/weather\nconditions and equipment status if the curtailment were not in place. This will be\ngreater than the net generation.\n\nSee Attachment B and Attachment E to this Appendix F for additional guidance and\nexamples.\n\n_5.1.3 Real-Time High Operating Limit_\n\nFor purposes of clarity due to the unique nature of Wind Plants, a Wind Plant RealTime High Operating Limit (RTHOL) is the maximum power production (MW) the\nWind Plant would be capable of in real-time, given ideal wind conditions and no\nCurtailment. (See Attachment B and Attachment E to this Appendix F for additional\nguidance and examples).\n\nWind speeds should not affect the calculation of RTHOL; this includes both wind\nspeeds that are below cut-in as well as wind speeds that are above cut-out.\n\nWhen icing, or other similar conditions occur, the RTHOL should be reduced to\nreflect the generation capability given those conditions. If one or more turbines are\nunable to produce energy given the conditions it should be reported equivalent to a\nturbine outage.\n\n_5.1.4 Wind Plant Future Availability_\n\nWind Plant Future Availability is equivalent to the future hour’s expected RTHOL and\nshould therefore be calculated using the same methodology as RTHOL but with the\nexpected turbine conditions for the hour being calculated.\n\nIn contrast to all other Real-Time data which is provided to the ISO via telemetry,\nWind Plant Future Availability is provided to the ISO using the ISO-NE Wind\nIntegration web services. This web service can also be used to gather wind plant\npower forecasts provided by the ISO-NE wind power forecaster. Information on using\nthe web service platform, including data specification and sample files are available\nin the following Zip file: https://www.iso-ne.com/static[assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sam](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)\n[ple_files_AssetID_change.zip](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2016/08/wind_integration_data_exchange_specification_and_sample_files_AssetID_change.zip)\n\n**5.2 Recommended Data Collection Points and Practices**\n\nIn order to provide that data of a high quality will be incorporated into the centralized\nforecasting system and allow for greater situational awareness, ISO recommends\nthat Wind Plant Operators follow the practices for data collection/calculation for each\nWind Plant as outlined below:\n\n1. Collect and provide to ISO, Meteorological Data from at least one met tower or\n\nother equivalent met equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment such as\nSODAR or LIDAR) that is strategically placed or utilized so that it will be\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\nimpacted to a minimal extent by plant operations (i.e., it is generally capable of\nproviding “free stream” data).\n\n2. The collection equipment should be capable of collecting measurements at, at\n\nleast, two heights (with the exception of air temperature, air pressure, and\nrelative humidity):\n\nA. Turbine hub height\n\nB. A second height at least 20 meters less than hub height.\n\n3. The Met Gathering Station equipment should be located at well‐exposed sites\n\nthat are upwind of the Wind Plant and no closer than two rotor diameters to\nthe nearest wind turbine. It is recommended that each wind turbine in the\nWind Plant should be within 5 km of a met gathering station.\n\n4. If ambient air temperature, ambient air pressure, and/or ambient air relative\n\nhumidity are measured by nacelle-level equipment, ISO prefers to receive any\nof this data from all of the nacelles providing wind speed data, in addition to\nthe single plant-wide measurement required.\n\n5. In order to avoid outage of data (e.g., from nacelle-level wind speeds) it is\n\nrecommended that additional “backup” nacelles are selected in addition to the\nrequired data specified in Section 5.1.1 for the number of nacelles providing\ndata to simultaneously collect and transmit the required data. When this\nrecommendation is followed, as near as possible the “next most” wind turbine\nin each group should be used to supply data (e.g., the second highest wind\nturbine in a Wind Turbine Group, the second farthest North wind turbine in the\nWind Turbine Group, etc.) and the wind turbine locations should also be\nreferenced to the static plant data supplied location(s). If available, ISO\nprefers to receive nacelle-level data from all the wind turbine nacelles within\nthe Wind Plant.\n\n6. Nacelle-level Plant Wind Speeds should be measured by equipment that is\n\nmounted in, on, or nearby the nacelle/rotor assembly with reasonable attempt\nto minimize the effects of rotor “prop-wash”, obstruction, and nacelle speed-up\neffects such that power output can be estimated to within 10% of actual using\nsuitable calibration and the turbine power curve(s)[3]).\n\n7. Utilize the Do-Not-Exceed (DNE) Dispatch Limit provided by the ISO over the\n\nRTU, along with the Wind Plant’s possible power production capability when\ndetermining if the Wind Plant is operating in a Curtailed mode.\n\n      - If the Wind Plant DNE limit is lower than the possible power production,\n\nthis may be considered a Curtailment.\n\n3 See for example NREL/CP-500-32494 within Smith, et al: “Applicability of Nacelle Anemometer Measurements for\n\nUse in Turbine Power Performance Tests,” NREL/CP-500-32494 available at:\n[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/32494.pdf](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/32494.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n   - If the Wind Plant DNE limit is not lower than the possible power\n\nproduction, this would not be considered a Curtailment.\n\n8. Maximum leading and lagging reactive capabilities should reflect values that\n\ncan be reached within 1 minute and maintained for no less than 1 hour.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 6.

Even though the wind speed of\nTurbine 3 would normally support 0.5 MW of generation, because it is not available, the\npossible power production would also be 0 MW.\n\nTurbines 1 and 2 are available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW even though\nTurbine 1 is below the cut-in speed. The individual turbines possible power production are\ndetermined using the power curve and wind speeds.\n\nAdding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 6.6 MW.\n\nAdding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the total possible power\nproduction would be 0.3 MW, however, because the Wind Plant is not being curtailed\n(e.g. their DNE is not limiting their total possible power production), the WHL should equal\nthe net generation so the WHL is calculated to be 0.4 MW. Given that the net generation\nis 0.4 MW, which is higher than possible power production, this would indicate a potential\nsituation where the possible power production estimation does not have sufficient\ninformation to perfectly estimate the net generation and is why the WHL should be\nreported at 0.4 MW (because it is capable of generating 0.4 MW given the current\nconditions).\n\n|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes No|3 m/s 5 m/s 6 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 0.0 MW|0.0 MW 0.3 MW 0.0 MW|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n## Example 2:\n\n**Individual Turbine Details**\n\nWind Possible Power\nTurbine # Available RTHOL\n\nSpeed Production\n\nTurbine 1: Yes 8 m/s 3.3 MW 1.4 MW\n\nTurbine 2: Yes 11 m/s 3.3 MW 3.0 MW\n\nTurbine 3 Yes 10 m/s 3.3 MW 2.6 MW\n\n**Wind Plant Totals**\n\nDNE Limit: 5.0 MW\n\nNet Generation: 5.0 MW\n\nPossible Power Production: 7.0 MW\n\nRTHOL: 9.9 MW\n\nWHL: 7.0 MW\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nAll three turbines are available so each RTHOL is 3.3 MW. Together that results in a\nWind Plant RTHOL of 9.9 MW.\n\nUsing the wind speeds at each turbine, the total possible power production is estimated\nusing the power curve to be 7.0 MW. The current DNE limit is 5.0 MW, meaning the wind\nplant is currently being curtailed below what it could potentially achieve. Because it is\ncurtailed, the WHL should not match the net generation and would remain at 7 MW.\n\n|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes|8 m/s 11 m/s 10 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 3.3 MW|1.4 MW 3.0 MW 2.6 MW|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n## Example 3:\n\n**Individual Turbine Details**\n\nWind Possible Power\nTurbine # Available RTHOL\n\nSpeed Production\n\nTurbine 1: Yes 10 m/s 3.3 MW 2.0 MW\n\nTurbine 2: Yes 9 m/s 3.3 MW 2.6 MW\n\nTurbine 3 Yes* 10 m/s 1.0 MW 1.0 MW\n\n*Due to a small accumulation of ice on the blades of Wind Turbine 3, it has been limited\nto 1 MW of generation by the Wind Plant Operator.\n\n**Wind Plant Totals**\n\nDNE Limit: 6.0 MW\n\nNet Generation: 4.9 MW\n\nPossible Power Production: 5.6 MW\n\nRTHOL: 7.6 MW\n\nWHL: 4.9 MW\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTurbine 3 is available but limited to a maximum of 1 MW, so its RTHOL would be 1 MW.\nEven though the wind speed of Turbine 3 would normally support 2.0 MW of generation,\nbecause it is only available up to 1 MW, the possible power production would also be 1\nMW.\n\nTurbines 1 and 2 are fully available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW. The individual\nturbines possible power production are determined using the power curve and wind\nspeeds.\n\nAdding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 7.6 MW.\n\nAdding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the plant total would be\n5.6 MW. The DNE limit is currently 6.0 MW, which while is being lower than the RTHOL,\nis above the 5.6 MW the wind plant is capable of producing, so it is not being curtailed.\nBecause it is not curtailed, the WHL should equal the net generation so the WHL is\ncalculated to be 4.9 MW.\n\n|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes*|10 m/s 9 m/s 10 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 1.0 MW|2.0 MW 2.6 MW 1.0 MW|\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternative Technology Regulation Resources, Appendix F\n\n## Example 4:\n\n**Individual Turbine Details**\n\nWind Possible Power\nTurbine # Available RTHOL\n\nSpeed Production\n\nTurbine 1: Yes 22 m/s 3.3 MW 3.3 MW\n\nTurbine 2: Yes 26 m/s 3.3 MW 0.0 MW\n\nTurbine 3 Yes 23 m/s 3.3 MW 3.3 MW\n\n**Wind Plant Totals**\n\nDNE Limit: 6.0 MW\n\nNet Generation: 4.9 MW\n\nPossible Power Production: 6.6 MW\n\nRTHOL: 9.9 MW\n\nWHL: 6.6 MW\n\nExplanation:\n\nTurbine 2 is available so its RTHOL would be 3.3 MW even though, based on the wind\nspeed being above cut-out speed, the possible power production is 0.0 MW. The RTHOL\nshould still be reported as 3.3 MW as long as it is available, because if the wind speed\ndrops down within the operable range, the wind turbine would immediately be able to\nbegin generating again.\n\nTurbines 1 and 3 are also available so their RTHOL would both be 3.3 MW. The\nindividual turbines possible power production are determined using the power curve and\nwind speeds.\n\nAdding the RTHOL of each individual turbine, the Wind Plant RTHOL is 9.9 MW.\n\nAdding the possible power production of each individual turbine, the total would be 6.6\nMW. With a DNE limit of 6.0 MW, this would indicate the Wind Plant is being curtailed and\nthe WHL would be calculated to be 6.6 MW. Under this condition, the Wind Plant would\nbe normally be expected to increase the generation up to the DNE limit. If this were not\npossible it would indicate an error in the possible power production calculation, and\nsubsequently WHL, which should be corrected to the amount of generation that was\npossible, or 4.9 MW in this example.\n\n|Turbine #|Available|Wind Speed|RTHOL|Possible Power Production|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Turbine 1: Turbine 2: Turbine 3|Yes Yes Yes|22 m/s 26 m/s 23 m/s|3.3 MW 3.3 MW 3.3 MW|3.3 MW 0.0 MW 3.3 MW|\n\n\n-----\n\n"},

Transmission, Markets, and Services\nTariff (ISO Tariff), Section II, Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT),\nSchedule 16 - Blackstart Service (Schedule 16) and this OP may be evaluated\nby ISO and the SRWG to determine if that resource provides benefit to the Plan.\nEither the Blackstart Owner or ISO may initiate the evaluation process to\ndetermine whether a resource can provide a benefit to the Plan; however,\nregardless of the initiation of the evaluation process, participation in Blackstart\nService is through voluntary mutual agreement between ISO and the Blackstart\nOwner through the terms of a Blackstart Service Commitment.\n\nThe evaluation criteria to determine benefit to the Plan include (but are not\nlimited to) the resource:\n\n    - Real power capability,\n\n    - Reactive power capability,\n\n    - Frequency control capability,\n\n    - Voltage control capability,\n\n    - Interconnection voltage,\n\n    - Proximity to nuclear power plants,\n\n    - Proximity to inter-Local Control Center (LCC) interconnection points,\n\n    - Proximity to inter-Reliability Coordinator Area (RCA) interconnection\npoints,\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Time between system shutdown and resource availability for electrical\nloading,\n\n  - Geographic location.\n\nBased upon this evaluation, a resource may become a DBR and be included in\nthe Plan.\n\nThis OP contains the requirements and procedures for the application,\nassessment, selection, and testing of DBRs in accordance with Schedule 16. A\nBlackstart Owner may obtain Blackstart Capability Test (Test) data for each DBR\nin its portfolio, including the date of the last successful Test, from the monthly\nupdates on the ISO Market Information System (MIS).\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **BLACKSTART RESOURCE ADMINISTRATION**\n\n**1.

The explanation shall\nbe bound by the constraints of the ISO Information Policy.\n\n**3. Blackstart Resource Program Administration and Requirements**\n\nA. Testing and Reporting Requirements\n\nEach DBR that provides Blackstart Service shall have completed a\nsuccessful Test, and meet testing and reporting requirements, within the\npast 12 months.\n\nTo perform a successful Test, a Blackstart Owner shall:\n\n1) Coordinate with the applicable TO to ensure that any required\n\ntransmission outage requests for equipment necessary to isolate the\nDBR or equipment necessary to be energized during the testing are\nsubmitted through the transmission outage coordination process.\n\n2) Submit an outage application in the ISO’s outage scheduling software.\n\nRequests shall come through the generator outage request process.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event that the Test would not impact generator startup or\nnotification times, an informational application shall still be submitted\nthrough the ISO’s outage scheduling software.\n```\n   o The SRWG shall review the impact of outage applications for\n\n```\ntesting pursuant to M/LCC 11 - Verification of New England System\nRestoration Plan\n\n3) Request and receive permission from ISO and applicable LCC control\n\nrooms prior to commencing the Test.\n\n4) Start the DBR without support from either offsite power or another\n\nDBR.\n\n5) Verify that the DBR is ready for electrical loading within the stated\n\nresponse time specification declared in OP-11, App D after Test\ninitiation.\n\n6) Demonstrate stable operation of the DBR for a minimum of 10 minutes\n\nwhile it remains isolated.\n\n7) Test operating aids and auxiliary systems required for DBR operation.\n\n8) Verify that emergency communications circuits are operable by\n\ncontacting ISO or the applicable LCC during the Test.\n\n9) Verify that the DBR output circuit breaker can be closed into a de\nenergized bus by energizing a de-energized transmission element or\ngenerating station switchyard element if that energization does not\ninvolve the disconnection of load that is not dedicated generating\nstation load to conduct the test. ISO, the LCC, and the Blackstart\nOwner shall coordinate to determine the appropriate element to be\nenergized. If the energization would require disconnection of load that\nis not dedicated generating station load, the output circuit breaker shall\nbe verified as capable of closing to a de-energized bus. Verification\nmay take the form of energizing the closing coil with the frequency and\nvoltage monitoring circuits disconnected, or any other acceptable\nphysical verification of breaker closing ability.\n\n10) Verbally report the result of the Test to ISO and applicable LCC control\n\nrooms within 15 minutes of the completion of the Test (this notification\nis typically performed at the same time that the outage application end\ntime is provided to ISO and the LCC). Test failures require the\nsubmittal of an application reflecting loss of blackstart capability in the\nISO’s outage scheduling software. Failures shall be corrected as soon\nas possible.\n\nISO shall:\n\n1) Study and respond to the Test request;\n\n\n-----\n\n2) Verify that the DBR is declared out-of-service during the outage as\n\nnecessary.\n\nWithin 30 calendar days following completion of the Test, the Lead Market\nParticipant (Lead MP) shall submit the following by email to blackstart@isone.com:\n\n1) A complete OP-11, Appendix E - Designated Blackstart Resource Test\n\nLog (App E), using OP-11, Appendix F - Instructions for Completing the\nDesignated Blackstart Resource Test Log (App F).\n\n2) A copy of the local generator test procedure used to perform the\n\nblackstart test.\n\nA Blackstart Owner may submit documented demonstration of actual\nblackstart performance that meets the requirements for a successful Test as\ndocumented in OP-11, App E. The Blackstart Owner shall comply with the\naudit testing verbal communication and audit documentation requirements for\nconsideration of Test compliance.\n\nISO or the SRWG have the right to be present during the performance of a\nTest and to inspect aspects of the DBR, including procedures and records,\nthat pertain to the operation and maintenance of Blackstart Service.\n\nB. Requirements for Performance During a System Restoration\n\nDBRs are an integral portion of any system restoration; therefore, any\nDBR that is not on an outage in accordance with ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 5 - Resource Maintenance and Outage\nScheduling (OP-5), regardless of Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO)\nstatus, shall be maintained such that it can meet the Blackstart Service\nMinimum Criteria at all times.\n\nDuring a system restoration, a DBR shall be able to:\n\n1) Start up and remain energized without support from either offsite power\n\nor another DBR\n\n2) Self-supply its own load for stable operation\n\n3) Be ready to receive transmission load, at the direction of ISO or the\n\nLCC, as soon as possible but definitely within the stated response time\nspecification from OP-11, App D and measured from the time of\nsystem shutdown\n\n4) Close its output circuit breaker to a de-energized bus, as instructed\n\n5) Support the process of energizing transmission by providing real\n\npower, reactive power, frequency support, and voltage support.\n\n\n-----\n\n**4. Failure to Meet Blackstart Service Obligations**\n\nDBRs are the cornerstone of the Plan. As such:\n\n1) Any inability to provide Blackstart Service shall be reported to ISO and\n\nthe applicable LCC control rooms by the DE within 15 minutes of\nidentifying the inability to provide Blackstart Service.\n\n2) Notification shall also be emailed by the Lead MP to ISO within 30\n\ncalendar days at: blackstart@iso-ne.com\n\nISO shall assess all information associated with a DBR inability to meet its\nBlackstart Service Minimum Criteria and Blackstart Service obligations. If ISO\ndetermines, based on that assessment that a Failure to Maintain Blackstart\nCapability or a Failure to Perform During a System Restoration event\n(collectively or individually a “Failure”) has occurred, ISO shall notify the\nBlackstart Owner. A Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage (as defined in\nOP-5) that has been applied for and approved in accordance with OP-5 shall\n**not be considered a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability, except for a**\nPlanned Outage or Maintenance Outage that extends past its original planned\nduration by more than five calendar days. If a Planned Outage or\nMaintenance Outage extends past its original planned duration by more than\nfive calendar days, then, at 0001 of the sixth calendar day, the DBR shall be\nconsidered to be in a Failure to Maintain Blackstart Capability status. A\nPlanned Outage, Maintenance Outage, or Forced Outage that is the direct\nresult of a transmission outage shall not be considered a Failure to Maintain\nBlackstart Capability until the transmission outage has been completed. In\naddition to providing the outage details through the outage scheduling\nprocess of OP-5, the Blackstart Owner shall email notification of Forced\nOutages or extensions to Maintenance Outages or Planned Outages to ISO\nat blackstart@iso-ne.com.\n\nUpon correction of the Failure:\n\n1) The Blackstart Owner shall notify the ISO and each appropriate LCC\n\ncontrol room of the correction.\n\n2) The Blackstart Owner shall email notification of the correction to\n\n[blackstart@iso-ne.com.](mailto:blackstart@iso-ne.com)\n\n3) ISO shall promptly provide acknowledgement of the correction\n\nnotification.\n\n\n-----\n\n**5. Blackstart Service Commitment Termination**\n\nA DBR Blackstart Service Commitment may be terminated either by mutual\nagreement or by unilateral termination by ISO or the Blackstart Owner. The\ntermination notification shall be in accordance with Schedule 16 and shall be\nsubmitted to ISO through ASK ISO. Following the termination date, ISO and\nthe resource shall no longer be obligated under Schedule 16, this OP or the\nPlan.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OP-11 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior**\nto the RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

Reductions to eliminate the ramp constraint will be made to External Transactions on all\n\nselected external interfaces simultaneously using the same methodology.\n\n2. Transactions helping the ramp constraint will be excluded from the ramp constraint\n\nevaluation. Therefore, External Transactions flowing in the opposite direction of the ramp\nconstraint will be excluded from the ramp constraint evaluation. In addition, External\nTransactions flowing in the same direction as the ramp constraint but that have a MW value\nthat is changing in the opposite direction of the ramp constraint will continue to be scheduled\n(e.g., an import transaction is changing from 100 MW to 50 MW during an import ramp\nconstraint).\n\n3. Wheel-through transactions will be excluded from the ramp constraint evaluation.\n\n4. All External Transactions will be categorized into one or two of the four groups described\n\nbelow:\n\nGroup 1: External Transactions submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market and\n\nwhose schedule is directly impacting the ramp constraint (e.g., an import\ntransaction is changing from 0 MW to 150 MW during an import ramp\nconstraint).\n\nGroup 2: External Transactions submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market and\n\nwhose schedule is not changing during the time of the ramp constraint.\n\nGroup 3: External Transactions that have cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, have a\n\ncorresponding transaction submitted into the Real-Time Energy Market under the\nsame transaction identifier and whose schedule is directly impacting the ramp\nconstraint (e.g., an import transaction is changing from 0 MW to 150 MW during\nan import ramp constraint).\n\nGroup 4: External Transactions that have cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, have a\n\ncorresponding transaction submitted into the Real-Time Energy Market under the\nsame transaction identifier and whose schedule is not changing during the time of\nthe ramp constraint.\n\n5. The scheduling under the ramp constraint will occur as described below:\n\na) A single External Transaction can have MW in one or two of the groups described above\n\n(e.g., an External Transactions that is submitted only into the Real-Time Energy Market\n\n\n-----\n\nwhose schedule is changing from 100 MW to 150 MW would have 50 MW in Group 1\nand 100 MW in Group 2).\n\nb) Reductions will be made to Group 1 first, Group 2 second, Group 3 third and then to\n\nGroup 4. All the MW from External Transactions within one group will be reduced to\nzero MW before utilizing any MW from a subsequent group.\n\nc) If only a portion of the MW within a group are required to resolve the ramp constraint,\n\nthe evaluation of all External Transactions within that group to determine which\ntransactions are reduced shall be made in a manner consistent with the normal\nscheduling rules – economics, priority and timestamp.\n\n**B.** **Scheduling Reductions and Curtailments Related to A Minimum Generation Emergency**\n\n1. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on import External Transactions\n\nsubmitted under III.1.10.7A that would create or worsen a Minimum Generation\nEmergency, the External Transactions will be impacted on the basis of economic merit\norder, where a tie in economics will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.\n\n2. When scheduling reductions or curtailment are required on import External Transactions\n\nsubmitted under III.1.10.7 that would create or worsen a Minimum Generation Emergency\nthe following rules will be applied:\n\na) If a Minimum Generation Emergency Warning has been issued and a reduction is\n\nrequired to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have not also cleared\nthe Day-Ahead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions shall first\nconsider price where the most expensive transactions are reduced first. If there is a tie in\nprice, the transaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker where those with the lowest\npriority are reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time Energy\nMarket timestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker, where the most\nrecent submittals are reduced first.\n\nb) If a Minimum Generation Emergency has been declared and after reductions have been\n\nmade to transactions not cleared in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, if a reduction is then\nrequired to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have cleared the DayAhead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions shall first consider\nprice. However, the price associated with all Real-Time Energy Market External\nTransactions that have cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market are equal and the\ntransaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker, where those with the lowest priority\nare reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time Energy Market\ntimestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker where the most recent\nsubmittals are reduced first.\n\n**C. Scheduling Reductions and Curtailments Related to Capacity Deficient Conditions**\n\n1. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on export External Transactions\n\nsubmitted under III.1.10.7A that would create or worsen a capacity deficient condition, the\nExternal Transactions will be reduced on the basis of economic merit order, where a tie in\neconomics will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. When scheduling reductions or curtailments are required on export External Transactions\n\nsubmitted under III.1.10.7 that would create or worsen a capacity deficient condition for the\noverall New England RCA/BAA the following rules will be applied.\n\na) Export External Transactions with the Special Exception Non-CSO Export that satisfy\n\nIII.1.10.7(i) will be excluded from this process:\n\nb) If a reduction is required to Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have\n\nnot cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market, the reduction to that group of transactions\nshall first consider price where the least expensive transactions are reduced first. If there\nis a tie in price, the transaction priority shall be used as the tiebreaker where those with\nthe lowest priority are reduced first. If there is a tie in transaction priority, the Real-Time\nEnergy Market timestamp of the transaction shall be used as the tiebreaker where the\nmost recent submittals are reduced first.\n\nc) If OP-4 has been declared and after reductions have been made to transactions that did\n\nnot clear the Day-Ahead Energy Market, if a reduction is then required to Real-Time\nEnergy Market External Transactions that have cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market,\nthe reduction to that group of transactions shall first consider price. However, if the price\nassociated with all Real-Time Energy Market External Transactions that have cleared the\nDay-Ahead Energy Market are equal, the transaction priority shall be used as the\ntiebreaker, where those with the lowest priority are reduced first.

Operating Reserve requirements\naddress:\n\n1. Loss of generating equipment within the New England RCA/BAA or within any\n\nother Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) RCA/BAA.\n\n2. Loss of transmission equipment within or between NPCC RCA/BAAs that may\n\nresult in a reduction of energy transfer capability within the New England\nRCA/BAA or between the New England RCA/BAA and any other RCA/BAA.\n\n3. Regulation in the New England RCA/BAA.\n\n4. Errors in forecasting New England RCA/BAA loads.\n\nThis Operating Procedure (OP) sets forth criteria for the establishment and\nadministration of Operating Reserve and Regulation in the New England RCA/BAA.\n\nThe objective is to ensure that the New England RCA/BAA Bulk Electric System\n(BES) is operated at the level of reliability prescribed in North American Electric\nReliability Corporation (NERC), NPCC and ISO New England (ISO) criteria.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PART II - DEFINITIONS**\n\nSome of the following terms are defined in Section I of the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (Tariff) and have been included here for\nconvenience. If there are any discrepancies between the definitions of those terms\nincluded below and the definitions in the Tariff, the Tariff controls.\n\n**First Contingency Loss - The largest capacity outage that would result from the**\nloss of a single element.\n\n**Operating Reserve - is Ten-Minute Spinning Reserve (TMSR), Ten-Minute Non-**\nSpinning Reserve (TMNSR) and Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve (TMOR)\n\n**Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) - is an**\nelectric power system or combination of electric power systems to which a\ncommon automatic generation control (AGC) scheme is applied in order to:\n\n(i) Match, at all times, the power output of the generators within the electric\n\npower system(s) and capacity and energy purchased from entities outside\nthe electric power system(s) with the load within the electric power\nsystem(s);\n\n(ii) Maintain scheduled interchange with other RCAs/BAAs within the limits of\n\nGood Utility Practice;\n\n(iii) Maintain the frequency of the electric power system(s) within reasonable\n\nlimits in accordance with Good Utility Practice and the criteria of the\napplicable regional reliability council or NERC; and\n\n(iv) Provide sufficient generating capacity to maintain Operating Reserves in\n\naccordance with Good Utility Practice.\n\n**Regulation - is the capability of a specific Resource with appropriate**\ntelecommunications, control and response capability to respond to an AGC\nSetPoint.\n\n**Replacement Reserve - is described in Part III, Section VII of this OP.**\n\n**Reportable Events - are system disturbances involving losses of generation or**\ntransmission facilities, which equal or exceed the following criteria:\n\n     - Actual net (interchange) tie-line flow deviations equal to or greater than 500\n\nMW\n\n     - Loss of generation equal to or greater than 500 MW\n\n**Second Contingency Loss - The largest capacity outage that would result from**\nthe loss of a single element, after allowing for the First Contingency Loss.\n\n**Ten-Minute Reserve - is the sum of TMSR and TMNSR that is fully available**\nwithin ten minutes from the time first requested.\n\n**Ten-Minute Non-Spinning Reserve (TMNSR) - is the reserve capability of:**\n\n\n-----\n\n(1) a generating Resource that can be converted fully into energy within ten\n\nminutes from the request of the ISO;\n\n(2) a Dispatchable Asset Related Demand (DARD) that can be fully utilized\n\nwithin ten minutes from the request of ISO to reduce consumption; or\n\n(3) a Demand Response Resource (DRR) that can provide demand reduction\n\nwithin ten minutes from the request of the ISO.\n\n**Ten-Minute Spinning Reserve (TMSR) - is the reserve capability of:**\n\n(1) a generating Resource that is electrically synchronized to the New\n\nEngland Transmission System that can be converted fully into energy\nwithin ten minutes from the request of the ISO;\n\n(2) a DARD that is electrically synchronized to the New England\n\nTransmission System that can reduce energy consumption to provide\nreserve capability within ten minutes from the request of the ISO; or\n\n(3) a Demand Response Resource that has been dispatched that can\n\nprovide demand reduction within ten minutes from the request of the ISO\nfor which none of the associated Demand Response Assets have a\ngenerator whose output can be controlled located behind the Retail\nDelivery Point other than emergency generators that cannot operate\nelectrically synchronized to the New England Transmission System.\n\n**Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve (TMOR) - is the reserve capability of:**\n\n(1) a generating Resource that can be converted fully into energy within thirty\n\nminutes from the request of the ISO;\n\n(2) a DARD that can be fully utilized within thirty minutes from the request of\n\nthe ISO to reduce consumption; or\n\n(3) a DRR that can provide demand reduction within thirty minutes from the\n\nrequest of the ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PART III - PROCEDURE**\n\n**I.** **REAL-TIME** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENTS**\n\nA. Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement\n\nDuring normal conditions, ISO shall maintain a quantity of ten-minute reserve\nat least equal to the amount required to replace the First Contingency Loss in\nthe New England RCA/BAA. In order to meet the NERC Disturbance Control\nStandard, the ISO Chief Operating Officer (COO) (or designee) may add a\nnon-performance factor to the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement based on\nhistoric Resource performance.\n\nThe energy associated with Regulation Reserves (Section VI) that is available\nwithin ten (10) minutes may be used to satisfy the Ten-Minute Reserve\nRequirement. Every available Resource of generating capability, including\nselect Regulation Resources, DARDs, and capability made available by other\nqualifying load management techniques shall be considered for activation in an\neffort to maintain the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement at all times.\n\n1. TMSR Requirement\n\nOne hundred percent (100%) of the New England RCA/BAA Ten-Minute\nReserve Requirement shall be synchronized reserve except as described\nbelow.\n\n         - To the extent that, in the judgment of the ISO’s COO (or designee),\n\nthe New England RCA/BAA BES can be operated within NERC,\nNPCC, and ISO-established reliability criteria.\n\n        - The TMSR Requirement may be decreased to a minimum of twenty\nfive percent (25%) of the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement, in\naccordance with the following relationships:\n```\n           o The maximum TMSR Requirement shall be one hundred\n\n```\npercent (100%) of the New England RCA/BAA Ten-Minute\nReserve Requirement.\n```\n           o The TMSR Requirement shall increase by twenty percent\n\n```\n(20%) for every time ISO fails to return the New England\nRCA/BAA ACE to pre-contingency values or to zero (0) within\nfifteen (15) minutes when ISO experiences a contingency\ngreater than or equal to the NPCC Reportable Event[1]\nthreshold that is less than a NERC reportable Balancing\nContingency Event.\n```\n           o The TMSR Requirement may decrease by a maximum of\n\n```\ntwenty percent (20%) of the Ten-Minute Reserve\nRequirement, per month following the implementation month\nof any TMSR requirement increase.\n\n1 Reportable Event is defined in the NPCC Glossary of Terms.\n\n\n-----\n\nChanges in the TMSR Requirement caused by ISO performance in\nreturning the New England RCA/BAA ACE to pre-contingency values or to\nzero (0) within fifteen (15) minutes following an NPCC Reportable Event\nshall be calculated by the twentieth day of each month, for the previous\nmonth, and shall be applied at the beginning of the next month. The ISO’s\nCOO (or designee) may increase the TMSR Requirement above the\namounts specified by the above provisions.\n\nIf warranted to ensure recovery from a contingency, and to comply with\nestablished criteria, ISO shall, to the extent possible, activate Operating\nReserve based on economic priority. Should reliable operation of the\npower system require it, ISO shall, as it deems necessary, activate\nOperating Reserve.\n\nDuring periods when system conditions threaten to reduce actual tenminute reserve and/or TMSR quantity below the current prescribed levels,\nthe actual Ten-Minute Reserve and/or TMSR Requirement may be\nincreased by System Operators[2] to a value greater than 100% of the\ncurrent requirement in order to maintain system reliability.\n\nB. TMOR Requirement\n\nIn addition to the Ten-Minute Reserve Requirement, ISO shall maintain a\nquantity of TMOR at least equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Second\nContingency Loss. Any excess ten-minute reserve may be counted as ThirtyMinute Reserve.\n\nDuring periods when system conditions threaten to reduce ten-minute reserve\nbelow prescribed levels, TMOR shall be re-dispatched to maintain ten-minute\nreserve.\n\nDuring periods when system conditions threaten to reduce actual TMOR\nquantity below the current prescribed levels, the actual TMOR Requirement\nmay be increased by System Operators to a value greater than 100% of the\ncurrent requirement in order to maintain system reliability.\n\nC. Zonal Forward Reserve Requirements\n\nZonal Forward Reserve requirements are established for Reserve Zones and\nare further explained in Section III.9.2.2 of the Tariff. Zonal Forward Reserve\nrequirements reflect the need for 30-minute contingency response to provide\n2[nd] contingency protection for each import-constrained Reserve Zone. Zonal\nForward Reserve requirements may be satisfied only by Resources that are\nlocated within a Reserve Zone and that are capable of providing 30-minute or\nhigher quality reserve products.\n\n**II.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **DISTRIBUTION**\n\nOperating Reserve shall be distributed so that it can be fully utilized by ISO, for\n\n2 System Operator is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nany probable contingency without exceeding transmission system limitations. This\ndistribution shall also allow operation in accordance with NERC, NPCC, and ISO\nManuals, operating policies and procedures.\n\n**III.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **RESTRICTIONS**\n\nISO shall be responsible for designating the First Contingency Loss and the\nSecond Contingency Loss in the New England RCA/BAA. Frequent review of\nsystem configurations shall be conducted so that all probable capability losses,\nthat could be caused by a First Contingency Loss and resulting relay actions, are\nconsidered.\n\nWhen a generating resource is the largest First Contingency Loss in the New\nEngland RCA/BAA, and therefore used to calculate the Ten-Minute Reserve\nRequirement, the capability of the resource, in excess of its output, cannot be\nconsidered as Operating Reserve. However, when a generating resource is the\nlargest Second Contingency Loss in the New England RCA/BAA, the net capability\nof the resource, in excess of its output, may be considered as Operating Reserve.\n\nWhen allocating Operating Reserve to the various Resources throughout the New\nEngland RCA/BAA, ISO shall pay particular attention to temporary limitations and\nde-ratings. Only that capability that can actually supply MW in the applicable\nperiod shall be classified as Operating Reserve.\n\nOperating Reserve, if activated, shall be sustainable for at least one (1) hour from\nthe time of activation or the published NERC/NPCC criteria.  It is recognized that\nResources called upon to activate Operating Reserve will operate without relief\nuntil ISO determines that they are no longer needed.\n\n**IV.** **SHORTAGE** **OF** **OPERATING** **RESERVE**\n\nNormally, Operating Reserve shall be provided to prescribed levels of\nsynchronized and non-synchronized reserve from within the New England\nRCA/BAA. If available capability is insufficient to provide adequate Operating\nReserve, ISO shall implement the various Actions of ISO New England Operating\nProcedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency (OP-4), as appropriate to\nmaintain Operating Reserve requirements. During shortages of Operating\nReserve, TMOR shall be re-dispatched to maintain ten-minute reserve at the\nprescribed value.\n\nIn the event that ISO is arranging to purchase available emergency capacity and\nenergy, or energy only, in accordance with OP-4, and a shortage of ten-minute\nreserve is forecast, ISO will recognize that voltage reduction load relief available in\nten minutes (10) provides non-synchronized Operating Reserve.\n\n**V.** **OPERATING** **RESERVE** **-** **CAPABILITY** **UNDER** **TEST** **CONDITIONS**\n\nFrequently, some capability is used to supply energy needs while it is in a test\ncondition. This test energy normally is not released for ISO dispatch and shall be\nadded, megawatt-for-megawatt, to the Operating Reserve requirement. However,\nbased on the assumed degree of risk for the sudden loss of the total energy, ISO\nmay recognize the test energy risk as being similar to other non-test capability and\n\n\n-----\n\ncount the test energy as firm. In such cases, Operating Reserve requirements\nneed not be increased due to the test energy.\n\n**VI.** **REGULATION** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENT**\n\nISO shall maintain a portion of its synchronized capability on Regulation sufficient\nto satisfy the NERC Control Performance Standard.[3] The specific Regulation\nrequirements are identified in the Markets and Operations/ISO\n[Express/Operations Reports/Generation section of the ISO New England website.](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/operations/-/tree/daily-regulation-requirement)\n\n**VII.** **REAL-TIME** **REPLACEMENT** **RESERVE** **REQUIREMENT**\n\nIn addition to the Operating Reserve requirements, ISO shall maintain a quantity\nof Replacement Reserve in the form of additional TMOR for the purposes of\nmeeting the NERC requirement to restore its ten-minute reserve.\n\nISO will not activate emergency procedures, such as OP-4 or ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7), in order to maintain\nthe Replacement Reserve Requirement.\n\nIf, in the judgment of the ISO’s COO (or designee), the New England RCA/BAA\nmay be operated within NERC, NPCC, and ISO established criteria, the\nReplacement Reserve requirement may be decreased to zero based upon ISO’s\ncapability to restore ten-minute reserve to be within the NERC requirements.\n\n**VIII.** **TESTING** **OF** **RESPONSE** **RATES**\n\nAs outlined in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing\n(OP-23), ISO has the responsibility to conduct tests of response rates of both\nsynchronized and non-synchronized Resources.\n\nThe ability of Resources to demonstrate Operating Reserve capability shall be\ntested at regular intervals. ISO shall attempt to coordinate these tests within\nsystem conditions and Market Participants' normal testing practices.\n\n**IX.** **RESPONSIBILITY**\n\n**ISO is responsible for operating the New England RCA/BAA in accordance with**\nestablished NERC, NPCC, and ISO criteria. This includes the responsibility for\ndetermining when Operating Reserve above minimum levels prescribed shall be\nretained. Further, ISO is responsible for determining how best to meet Regulation\ncriteria and to manage tie-line flows, including flow deviations resulting from\ncontingencies.\n\n**ISO is also responsible for identifying the First Contingency Loss and the Second**\nContingency Loss; for determining the required amount of Operating Reserve; for\nspecifying the type, location, and quantity to be maintained; for selecting the\nnumber of Resources as well as the location of Resources to be assigned to\nRegulation; for determining the required amount of Replacement Reserve, and for\n\n3 Control Performance Standard is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunicating to the Resources for activating Operating Reserve in response to\ncontingencies in the New England RCA/BAA and/or external NPCC RCAs/BAAs.\n\n**LOCAL CONTROL CENTERS (LCCs)/MARKET PARTICIPANTS (MPs) are**\nresponsible for communicating to ISO current system conditions affecting\nOperating Reserve. The LCCs/MPs are also responsible for activating Operating\nReserve for localized problems within a local area when time does not permit\ncommunication with ISO. When Operating Reserve is used by any LCC, ISO is to\nbe notified as soon as practicable, and ISO shall take action to restore Operating\nReserve as soon as possible.\n\n**OP-8 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to**\nthe RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

The objectives in establishing these Emergency actions are:\n\n1. To protect reliable operation of the Eastern Interconnection.\n\n2. To restore balance between customers' load and available generation in\n\nthe shortest practicable time.\n\n3. To minimize risk of damage to equipment.\n\n4. To minimize interruption of customer service.\n\n**PART II - RESPONSIBILITY**\n\n**I.** **ISO New England Responsibility**\n\nISO has the responsibility and authority, in accordance with North American\nElectric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, Northeast Power\nCoordinating Council, Inc. (NPCC) Directories, the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets, and Service Tariff, applicable Transmission Operating\nAgreements and ISO OPs, including but not limited to ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No.1 - Central Dispatch Operating Responsibilities and\nAuthority (OP-1), to issue Operating Instructions that may be required for the\nimplementation of this OP, such as load shedding or opening of circuits, when\nthe Emergency situation involves:\n\nA. An overall capacity or energy deficiency in the New England Reliability\n\nCoordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area[1] (RCA/BAA) or in any area within\nthe New England RCA/BAA.\n\nB. The New England RCA/BAA interconnections with adjacent RCA/BAA\n\nsystems.\n\nC. Conditions on facilities external to New England caused by operations or\n\nconditions within the New England RCA/BAA.\n\nD. Transmission and/or generating facilities within the New England RCA/BAA.\n\nE. Any other Emergency conditions where ISO determines it appropriate.\n\n1 Reliability Coordinator Area, Balancing Authority Area and Operating Instruction are defined in the\n\nNERC Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **Local Control Center Responsibility**\n\nEach Local Control Center (LCC) has the responsibility and authority, in\naccordance with NERC Reliability Standards, NPCC Directories, applicable\nTransmission Operating Agreements and ISO OPs, including but not limited to\nOP-1, to issue Operating Instructions that may be required for the\nimplementation of this OP when the Emergency condition involves:\n\nA. A capacity or energy deficiency in an area wholly within the operating\n\njurisdiction of that LCC.\n\nB. The transmission and/or generating facilities under the operating jurisdiction\n\nof that LCC.\n\nC. The risk of damage to equipment under the operating jurisdiction of that LCC\n\nwhen accompanied by a loss of communications with ISO.\n\n**PART III - PROCEDURE**\n\n**I.** **Preparation For Implementation**\n\nThis OP may be implemented before, during or after action taken under ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During A Capacity Deficiency\n(OP-4) or ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 21 – Operational Surveys,\nEnergy Forecasting & Reporting and Actions During An Energy Emergency (OP21), depending on the circumstances of the Emergency. Normally, the potential\nneed for Emergency actions prescribed by this OP should be determined well in\nadvance of the time the actions must be implemented. However, implementation\nof OP-4 will typically precede implementation of this OP.\n\nWhen system conditions indicate that implementation of this OP may be\nnecessary, ISO and the LCCs shall establish and, if appropriate, maintain\ncontinuous communication in preparation for ISO to implement this OP. Prompt\naction may provide time to be more selective in the implementation of this OP.\n\nIf any LCC and ISO are unable to establish prompt communication, the LCC shall\nproceed to implement this OP independently.\n\nWhen time and circumstances allow, ISO and the LCCs shall discuss the\nEmergency conditions and reach consensus on the actions to be taken and the\ntiming of those actions.\n\nWhen operating circumstances do not allow time for consensus decisions, ISO\nand/or the LCC shall initiate the necessary actions prescribed by this OP with the\nunderstanding that actions resulting in the highest possible level of reliability shall\nbe taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **Procedures for Low Frequency Conditions**\n\nIn an Emergency characterized by a frequency drop, identification of the deficient\nRCA/BAA or RCAs/BAAs is vital to expedite corrective action. ISO System\nOperators[2] shall establish communications with other interconnected RCAs/BAAs\nas follows, to determine if possible, the cause of the frequency decline and the\naction required to restore frequency to 60.00 Hz.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSome of the actions will occur automatically regardless of the RCA/BAA causing\nthe frequency decline.\n\nA. When the cause of the declining frequency is outside of the New England\n\nRCA/BAA, ISO shall:\n\n     - Confirm existing interchange schedules with adjacent NPCC BAAs.\n\n     - Regulate the New England RCA/BAA ties to maintain the Frequency\nBiased Interchange Schedules.\n\n     - Increase the amount of Synchronized Reserve to be able to adjust the\n\nInterchange Schedule further, if needed.\n\n     - Make known to external RCAs/BAAs the amount of emergency capacity\n\nISO can make available.\n\n     - Actions described below may be implemented when external RCAs/BAAs\n\nrequest assistance from ISO.\n\nB. When the cause of the declining frequency is due to a deficiency in the New\n\nEngland RCA/BAA:\n\n     - Confirm existing Interchange Schedules with adjacent NPCC BAAs.\n\n     - Request assistance from external RCAs/BAAs up to the emergency\n\ntransfer limit of the interconnection Tie Lines.\n\nC. When the frequency declines to 59.90 Hz, ISO shall:\n\n     - Disconnect any pumped storage Dispatchable Asset Related Demand(s)\n\n(DARDs) operating in the pumping mode. They will be automatically\ndisconnected at 59.65 Hz.\n\n     - Dispatch non-synchronized Fast Start Generators and Fast Start Demand\n\nResponse Resources (DRRs) as required.\n\nD. When the frequency declines to 59.80 Hz ISO shall:\n\n     - Suspend Automatic Generation Control (AGC).\n\n2 System Operator is defined in the NERC Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NOTE**\n\nTransmission limitations or other reliability criteria may not allow the dispatch of\nall generators to Economic Maximum Limit (Economic Max).\n\n  - Issue an Operating Instruction to all generators to go to Economic Max at\n\nmaximum response rates, as appropriate.\n\nE. When the frequency declines to 59.50 Hz:\n\n  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide 7% load relief.\n\n  - Underfrequency relays (10 second anti-stall) shall provide an additional\n\n2% load relief\n\nF. When the frequency declines to 59.30 Hz:\n\n  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.\n\nG. When the frequency declines to 59.10 Hz:\n\n  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.\n\nH. When the frequency declines to 58.90 Hz:\n\n  - Underfrequency relays (fast) shall provide an additional 7% load relief.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nUp to 50% of the New England RCA/BAA load, including the 30% that is shed\nautomatically, can be shed manually. Details of the manual load shedding\nprocedure and statements to be used by System Operators are included in\nAppendix A to this OP.\n\nI. If the load shedding by automatic underfrequency relays does not stabilize\n\nthe frequency and it continues to decline below 58.50 Hz:\n\n  - If currently synchronized to the Eastern Interconnection, ISO shall issue\n\nan Operating Instruction for manual load shedding in accordance with\nAppendix A to this OP to the extent necessary to restore Area Control\nError (ACE) to zero.\n\n  - If not currently synchronized to the Eastern Interconnection, ISO shall\n\nissue an Operating Instruction for manual load shedding in accordance\nwith Appendix A to this OP to the extent necessary to restore frequency to\n60.00 Hz.\n\n  - All generators shall take necessary action per NPCC Directory # 2\n\nEmergency Operations, including separating generators from the system,\nto preserve generation and minimize damage and service interruptions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **Procedures for a Transmission Emergency**\n\nOperation of the transmission system under Emergency Conditions shall be\ngoverned by ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission\nOperations (OP-19). To maintain system reliability, ISO and the LCCs may take\nEmergency actions, including the switching of transmission elements,\nimplementing voltage reductions, and the shedding of firm load.\n\nISO and the LCC System Operators shall keep operations management at ISO\nand the LCCs advised as to conditions that might necessitate review of the need\nto implement Emergency actions on a pre-contingency basis.\n\n**IV.** **Procedures for Unacceptable Voltage Conditions**\n\nISO New England Operating Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control\n(OP-12) and various voltage guides define criteria and establish guides for\nactions to be taken so that desirable levels of voltage are maintained on the\ntransmission system. The LCCs shall make every effort to correct unacceptable\nvoltage conditions and shall coordinate actions with ISO.\n\nWhen unacceptable voltage conditions occur and corrective actions described in\nOP-12 and/or the voltage guides are not effective, the ISO System Operators\nand/or LCC System Operators shall take Emergency actions, as defined in\nOP-19, to correct the situation.\n\nISO System Operators and LCC System Operators shall keep operations\nmanagement at ISO and the LCCs advised as to conditions that might\nnecessitate review of the need to implement Emergency actions on a precontingency basis.\n\n**V.** **Restoration of Load**\n\nISO shall issue an Operating Instruction for the restoration of any load shed\npursuant to this OP when system conditions permit.\n\n\n-----\n\n# OP-7 Revision History\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to**\nthe RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

The weekly PLEs are derived from ratios\nrelating the projected weekly peak load to the seasonal peak load. The seasonal\npeak loads are projected in the annual ISO New England Capacity, Energy, Loads,\nand Transmission (CELT) Report.\n\nThe summer PLE period begins with the first full week of June and continues through\nthe end of the second full week of September. The winter PLE period is three (3)\nweeks, starting with the first full week in January, not inclusive of the week with the\nNew Year’s holiday. PLEs for all other weeks are represented as fractional ratios of\nthose projected seasonal peaks.\n\nThe fractional ratios used to compute weekly PLEs are based on historical peak load\ndata. The historical weekly peak are first sorted such that week twenty-seven (27) is\nthe week of July 4th in each of the years. The reconstituted weekly maximum load\nfor a five (5) week rolling window, centered on the reported week, was then related to\nthe weather-normalized, seasonal peak load as follows:\n\n   - weeks one (1) through eighteen (18) seasonal winter peak,\n\n   - weeks nineteen (19) through thirty-nine (39) seasonal summer peak,\n\n    - weeks forty (40) through fifty-two (52) succeeding seasonal winter peak.\n\nThese weekly to seasonal peaks are represented as fractions. Judgment based on\nreview of historic weather patterns and seasonal peak occurrence was applied to the\ncurves.\n\n\n-----\n\npp\n\n**Long Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM):**\n\nThe Long Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM) is a measure of the New\nEngland RCA/BAA projected weekly capacity margin. A positive value of LTOCM\nindicates a potential operable capacity surplus over and above the estimated load\nplus Operating Reserve requirement. A negative value indicates that a potential\noperable capacity deficiency could occur. The LTOCM and its components are\ndefined below:\n\nLTOCM = A + B – C – D – E – F – G + H where:\n\nA is the Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) of all Resources including any\n\nexpected Resources reactivations and new commercial Resources.\n\nB is the sum of the external import capacity purchases\n\nC is the forecast 50/50 PLE.\n\nD is the Operating Reserve requirement as defined in ISO New England\n\nOperating Procedure No. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation (OP-8).\n\nE is the total of Resource Planned Outages (POs) for the period. This value\n\nwould also include any known long-term Forced Outages (FO)s.\n\nF is the allowance for Unplanned Outages as defined within SOP\nOUTSCH.0030.0040 - Perform Long Term Resource Outage Coordination.\n\nG is the allowance for gas-at-risk generation as defined within SOP\nOUTSCH.0030.0040 - Perform Long Term Resource Outage Coordination.\n\nH is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.\n\nThe CSO for all Resources shall be used in accordance with the most recently\npublished monthly CSO/Nominated Consumption Limit reports and adjusted using\nthe most recent information for new Resources. The PLE used shall be based upon\nthe most recently published CELT Report.\n\n\n-----\n\npp\n\n**Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM):**\n\nThe Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM) is a measure of the projected\nweekly operable capacity margin on a sub-area basis. A positive LOCM value\nindicates a projected operable capacity surplus available to respond to a second\ncontingency event within a sub-area. A negative value indicates that a potential\noperable capacity deficiency could occur. LOCM analyses are performed in addition\nto the full New England RCA/BAA analysis and are based on data included in the\nAnnual Maintenance Schedules.\n\nLOCM = A – B – C + D – E – F + G where:\n\nA is the CSOs of all Resources that are currently in service.  Resources\n\nreactivations and new Resources that have achieved commercial operation\nand are included in the third annual reconfiguration auction shall be\nincluded in the LOCM calculations.\n\nB is the total of POs during the period for all Resources in the sub-area. This\n\nvalue includes any known long-term FOs.\n\nC is a reliability adjustment reflecting the historical performance of combustion\n\nturbines.\n\nD is the import capability for the sub-area for the week.\n\nE is the forecast load for the sub-area, which is calculated by multiplying the\n\nNew England RCA/BAA 50/50 PLE by the sub-area percentage of system\nseasonal peak load.\n\nF is the largest single source, which is defined as the largest available\n\nResources in the sub-area during the period.\n\nG is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.\n\n\n-----\n\npp\n\n**Short Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM):**\n\nThe Short Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM) is a measure of the New\nEngland RCA/BAA projected capacity margin looking ahead 14 days or less.\nSTOCM is calculated using the components defined below. A positive value of\nSTOCM indicates a potential operable capacity surplus over and above the\nestimated capacity requirement. A negative value indicates that a potential operable\ncapacity deficiency could occur.\n\nSTOCM = A + B – C – D – E – F + G where:\n\nA is the CSOs of all Resources that are currently in service.\n\nB is the sum of the external Import Capacity Resource purchases.\n\nC is the forecast load. For future days 7-14, the 50/50 PLE is used. For\n\nfuture days 1-6, the ISO short-term load forecast is used. This forecast is\nbased on the forecasted weather.\n\nD is the Operating Reserve requirement as defined in OP-8.\n\nE is the total of Resources actually out-of-service for POs or Maintenance\n\nOutages (MOs), or scheduled or known to be out-of-service in the future\nperiod of 14 days or less.\n\nF is a reliability factor to adjust the overall STOCM by considering FOs, gas\nat-risk generation, changes in load, etc. The reliability factor shall be the\ngreater of gas-at-risk generation or 1,500 MW for day 1 through 6 and\n2,000 MW for day 7 through 14 of the short-term look-ahead period.\n\nG is an adjustment for Resources offering in excess of their CSO.\n\n\n-----\n\npp\n\n**Short Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM):**\n\nThe Short Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM) is a measure of the\nprojected capacity margin looking ahead 14 days or less on a sub-area basis. The\nSTLOCM is calculated using the components defined below. A positive STLOCM\nvalue indicates a projected operable capacity surplus available to respond to a\nsecond contingency event within a sub-area. A negative value indicates that a\npotential operable capacity deficiency could occur.\n\nSTLOCM = A – B – C + D – E – F + G where:\n\nA is the CSOs of all Resources in the sub-area that are currently in service.\n\nB is the total of POs during the period for all Resources in the sub-area. This\n\nvalue includes any known long-term FOs.\n\nC is a reliability adjustment reflecting the historical performance of combustion\n\nturbines.\n\nD is the import capability for the sub-area.\n\nE is the forecast load for the sub-area.

These provisions include:\n\n     - ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff Section\n\nIII, ISO New England Market Rule 1 - Standard Market Design (Market\nRule 1); and\n\n     - Section II.44 of the OATT contains the rules for scheduling and curtailing\n\nExternal Transactions on both the CTS Enabled Interface and non-CTS\ninterfaces; and\n\n     - The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)/ISO-NE\n\nCoordination Agreement), which includes the protocols for managing\nExternal Transactions associated with the CTS Enabled Interface;\n\nISO is prepared to modify schedules or reduce any and all transactions in the event\nthat available market-based options are insufficient to provide system reliability.\n\n1 The CTS Enabled Interface is the New York Northern AC Tie (NYN) external interface\n2 Non-CTS interfaces include the Cross Sound Cable (CSC), Northport to Norwalk Harbor Cable (NNC), Highgate,\n\nPhase I/II HVDC and NE/NB external interfaces.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **ISO ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO RTM EXTERNAL TRANSACTION SCHEDULING**\n\n**A. External Transaction e-Tag Requirements**\n\n1. All External Transactions submitted to ISO for physical implementation in\n\nthe RTM must have an associated e-Tag that complies with the\nrequirements of the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)\nElectronic Tagging Functional Specification. An e-Tag is required for each\nExternal Transaction to be implemented for which ISO is on the\nscheduling path as the Sink, Source, or intermediate Balancing Authority\n(BA).\n\n2. ISO reviews and actively approves, or denies, an e-Tag based solely on\n\nthe information provided in the e-Tag within the review time specified by\nthe North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability\nStandards INT-006 - Evaluation of Interchange Transactions.\n\n3. An e-Tag denial notification is automatically created when the e-Tag is\n\ndenied and includes the reason for the denial\n\n4. Prior to the start time indicated in the e-Tag, each e-Tag shall be\n\nassociated with an External Transaction submitted under Section III.1.10.7\nof the Tariff or the e-Tag will be terminated by ISO.\n\n5. Before implementing any External Transaction, whether for an import,\n\nexport, or wheel-through, ISO verifies that a complete, approved e-Tag\nexists for that External Transaction and that the energy profile on the eTag and the External Transaction are consistent.\n\n6. If, due to software issues, any variation exists between the e-Tag and the\n\nExternal Transaction, ISO Settlement staff shall utilize the External\nTransaction scheduled MW.\n\n**B. Verification of External Transactions on Non-CTS Interfaces**\n\n1. ISO validates each External Transaction submitted under Section\n\nIII.1.10.7 of the Tariff in order of submission through a combination of\nautomated software checks and manual review.\n\n2. Transmission Service Considerations\n\na. ISO verifies that appropriate and adequate advance transmission\n\nservice arrangements have been obtained from Transmission\nProviders (TP(s)) within the New England RCA/BAA. Where possible,\nverification is made through the Open Access Same-Time Information\nSystem (OASIS). If transmission service arrangements cannot be\nverified via the OASIS:\n\ni. ISO may use other means at its disposal to attempt to verify the\n\nexistence of proper transmission service arrangements.\n\nii. ISO may ask the entity submitting the External Transaction to state\n\nin writing that proper transmission service arrangements are in\nplace or to provide a copy of the transmission service agreement\nwith the TP.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\nb. If an External Transaction is implemented by ISO and the transmission\n\nservice arrangements are not adequate with any TP in the contract\npath the transmission customer may be subject to unauthorized use\ncharges under the TP’s tariff from which adequate transmission service\nwas not procured.\n\n3. ISO verifies that a valid e-Tag has been referenced and contains an\n\nenergy profile (MW over time) that is the same as or greater than the\nExternal Transaction.\n\n4. ISO verifies that any optional flags selected on the External Transaction\n\nwere referenced appropriately.\n\n5. ISO notifies the transaction submitter via the External Transaction\n\nscheduling software if an External Transaction has been rejected and the\nreason that it was rejected.\n\n6. Each modification of an External Transaction is validated by the External\n\nTransaction scheduling software and the ISO. The transaction timestamp\nis updated to reflect the time when the modification was submitted. ISO\nnotifies the transaction submitter via the External Transaction scheduling\nsoftware if a modification has been rejected and the reason why it was\nrejected.\n\n7. ISO does not review any External Transaction request that is submitted to\n\nISO outside of the submission and modification deadlines established in\nSection III of the Tariff.\n\n**C. Verification of External Transactions on CTS Enabled Interface**\n\n1. ISO does not directly review any External Transaction request that is\n\nsubmitted to the NYISO Joint Energy Scheduling System (JESS) prior to\nconsideration in the NYISO Real-Time Commitment (RTC).\n\n2. The e-Tag that is referenced on the NYISO JESS External Transaction is\n\nreviewed by ISO in accordance with Section II.A of this OP. Denial of the\ne-Tag or adjustment of the e-Tag MW by ISO will impact the consideration\nof the External Transaction in the NYISO RTC.\n\n**D. Day-Before Checkout**\n\n1. ISO performs a day prior check-out of External Transactions with each\n\nneighboring BA as part of the process to develop a preliminary\ninterchange for each external interface. The check-out compares the\ne-Tag ID and MW values of the External Transaction. No External\nTransaction is rejected because it does not checkout on the day prior with\nthe neighboring BA.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n**III.** **GENERAL SCHEDULING OF EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**A. Scheduling of RTM External Transactions on Non-CTS** **Interfaces**\n\n1. Only External Transactions verified by ISO are eligible for physical\n\nimplementation in the RTM.\n\n2. Each scheduling interval for an External Transaction is one hour,\n\nbeginning at the start of the clock hour and ending at the end of the clock\nhour, except where shorter intervals are allowed under the operating\nprotocols of ISO and the applicable external BA .\n\nNon-CTS Interface PNode Scheduling Interval\n\n.I.HQ_P1_P2345 5 hourly\n\n.I.HQHIGATE120 2 hourly\n\n.I.SHOREHAM138 99 hourly\n\n.I.NRTHPORT138 5 hourly\n\n.I.SALBRYNB345 1 hourly\n\n3. ISO schedules each External Transaction (import, export and wheel\nthrough transaction) in whole MW at the New England BAA boundary.\n\n4. ISO schedules each transaction and physically implements flow across\n\neach external interface for each scheduling interval of the Operating Day.\nEach import, export and wheel-through transaction is considered for each\nscheduling interval, based on the applicable Locational Marginal Price\n(LMP), on a net basis up to the applicable transfer limit determined for each\ninterface by ISO.\n\n5. In the event all economic External Transactions cannot be scheduled over\n\nan external interface, the scheduling rules for non-CTS interfaces in Section\nII.44.1 of the OATT are applied.\n\n6. The Real-Time Energy Market timestamp of a transaction, as identified in\n\nSection II.44.1 of the OATT and Appendix B of this OP, shall be used as the\ntiebreaker where the most recent submittals are reduced first. The\ntimestamp is considered at a granularity of one minute. For example, all\ntransactions submitted between 05:02:00 and 05:02:59 would have a\ntimestamp of 05:02. In the event of a tie in the timestamp, reductions will be\napplied pro-rata based on submitted MW.\n\n7. To the best of its ability, ISO reflects the impact of the economic loading of\n\nthe external interface for the next scheduling interval upon the projected\nExternal Node LMP. If ISO expects that the scheduling of priced\ntransactions may modify the projected LMP to the extent that those\ntransactions are no longer economic, those transactions may be\nscheduled in part or may not be scheduled.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n|Non-CTS Interface PNode|Scheduling Interval|\n|---|---|\n|.I.HQ_P1_P2345 5|hourly|\n|.I.HQHIGATE120 2|hourly|\n|.I.SHOREHAM138 99|hourly|\n|.I.NRTHPORT138 5|hourly|\n|.I.SALBRYNB345 1|hourly|\n\n\n-----\n\n8. ISO only allows the scheduling of Market Participant (MP) Emergency\n\nEnergy transactions (EETs) and out-of-merit imports in order to maintain the\nTen-Minute Reserve Requirement, unless unusual or unexpected reliability\nneeds or system conditions dictate a more conservative approach. An\nexample of such a condition is if Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve (TMOR)\nwould be depleted for more than four (4) hours.\n\n**B. Scheduling of External Transactions on the CTS Enabled interface**\n\n1. The CTS Enabled Interface is ordinarily scheduled every 15 minutes.\n\nCTS Enabled\n\nScheduling Interval\nInterface PNode\n\n.I.ROSETON 345 1 15 minutes\n\n2. When necessary to ensure or preserve system reliability, or when not able\n\nto implement schedules as expected due to software or communication\nissues, ISO and NYISO shall coordinate and determine when to temporarily\nemploy hourly scheduling on the CTS Enabled Interface in accordance with\nthe ISO-NE/NYISO Coordination Agreement.\n\n3. ISO schedules each External Transaction (import, export and wheel-through\n\ntransaction) in whole MW at the New England BAA boundary.\n\n**C. Sales of Energy Backed by Installed Capacity to External BAAs**\n\n1. Non-CTS interfaces: ISO shall review the status of generators referenced in\n\nExternal Transactions with the flag of Non-Capacity Supply Obligation\n(CSO) Export under either of the following conditions:\n\na. Whenever exports are being reduced to address Operating Reserve\n\nconditions to determine if the requirements of Section III.1.10.7 (i) of\nthe Tariff are satisfied; or\n\nb. Whenever scheduling on an associated external interface is\n\nconstrained to determine if the referenced generator is Self-Scheduled\nin the RTM and online at a MW level greater than or equal to the\nExternal Transaction sale’s MW amount.\n\n2. CTS Enabled Interface: ISO shall respond to requests from NYISO to\n\ndeliver capacity in Real-Time. Upon such a request, ISO shall review the\nstatus of the generators with capacity obligations to NYISO to determine if\nthe energy from those generators is available and deliverable.\n\n**D. Purchases of External Installed Capacity**\n\n1. Non-CTS interfaces: External Transactions with the flag of Import Capacity\n\nResource will be verified by ISO for expected delivery with neighboring BA.\n\n**2.** CTS Enabled Interface: ISO may request capacity associated with Import\n\nCapacity Resources located in NYISO as described in Schedule D of the\nNYISO/ ISO-NE Coordination Agreement. ISO shall not request capacity\nfrom NYISO unless forecasts indicate that a net import is needed on the\nCTS Enabled Interface to maintain the Operating Reserve requirements.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n|CTS Enabled Interface PNode|Scheduling Interval|\n|---|---|\n|.I.ROSETON 345 1|15 minutes|\n\n\n-----\n\n**E. Check Out with Neighboring BAs**\n\n1. ISO performs a check out of External Transactions submitted to the RTM\n\nthat are being considered for physical implementation for the next\nscheduling interval with each neighboring BA.\n\n2. If an External Transaction submitted to ISO for consideration for RTM\n\nimplementation does not check out with the neighboring BA for a given\nscheduling interval, ISO does not schedule the transaction for the\nassociated scheduling interval.\n\n3. If ISO cannot access the current Real-Time External Transaction data to\n\nperform the electronic checkout process, ISO will utilize the data from daybefore checkout process as the Real-Time External Transaction data.\n\n**F. Use of Optional Flags in Real-Time Processes**\n\nThe table below contains the optional flags that may be associated with an\nExternal Transaction submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff and\ndescribes what, if any, impact each flag has on the RT External Transaction\nscheduling process.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n|Optional Flags|Impact of Flag on Real-Time Processes|\n|---|---|\n|Excepted Transaction|The priority defined in Section II.44.1.a of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|\n|Grandfathered|The priority defined in Section II.44.1.a of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|\n|Import Resource|This indicates to ISO which transactions to verify for Real- Time capacity delivery with a neighboring area|\n|Non-CSO Export|The status of referenced ISO-NE generator reviewed if: a. the interface is constrained, and b. exports are being reduced to address reserve capacity conditions|\n|Local Second Contingency Commitment (LSCC) Export|If transaction meets criteria defined in Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff, the priority defined in Section II.44 of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|\n|Unconstrained Export|If transaction meets criteria defined in Section III.1.10.7(f) of the Tariff, the priority defined in Section II.44 of the OATT is assigned during general scheduling, reductions for reliability and curtailment|\n|EET Emergency|ISO shall only schedule when in appropriate actions of OP-4|\n|New Brunswick Security Energy Transactions|ISO shall only schedule to preserve minimum flows from New Brunswick [See Section IV and V.D]|\n|Generation Information System|No impact|\n\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV.** **REAL-TIME SCHEDULING RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nThis section addresses reliability considerations utilized during the RTM External\nTransaction scheduling process. These considerations include: a restriction on a\nspecific external interface for reliability, excessive change in system-wide net\ninterchange, approaching or reaching minimum generation conditions, and/or\napproaching or reaching a deficiency in Operating Reserve. If an External\nTransaction must be reduced due to any reliability condition, an appropriate\ndescription shall be included on the electronic notification of the scheduled MW\namount.\n\n**A. Ramp Constraints**\n\nImplementation of a large External Transaction or implementation of a number\nof External Transactions at the same time may cause a large change in the\nscheduled power flow on the ISO external ties from one scheduling interval to\nthe next. Such power swings on the external interfaces may create or worsen\nreliability concerns. Consequently, limitations may be placed on the allowed\nmagnitude of the change (i.e., ramping limitation) in scheduled External\nTransactions from one scheduling interval to the next scheduling interval. The\nprocess by which transactions are impacted by ramp constraints is defined in\nAppendix B of this OP.\n\nOn the CTS Enabled Interface, the default values, as defined in the ISONE/NYISO Coordination Agreement, are posted on the NYISO website and\nenforced by the NYISO RTC solution.\n\n**B. Minimum Generation Conditions**\n\nWhen scheduling External Transactions for the next scheduling interval, prior\nto declaring a Minimum Generation Emergency, ISO shall, in the order listed\nbelow if possible, restrict the scheduling of Real-Time Energy Market External\nTransactions purchases in order to maintain sufficient backdown margin on\nResources:\n\n1. On the CTS-Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of purchases\n\nsubmitted under Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff such that the resulting net\ninterchange schedule is not an import but is a value between the net of the\nExternal Transactions that cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market and\nsubsequently satisfied the day-before checkout process for that\nscheduling interval and zero, and then,\n\n2. On the non CTS-Enabled interfaces, restrict the scheduling of purchases\n\nsubmitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that have not cleared the\nDay-Ahead Energy Market for that scheduling interval.\n\nIf the ISO declares a Minimum Generation Emergency pursuant to Section\nIII.2.5(c) of the Tariff, the following steps will be taken to maintain system\nreliability:\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n1. On the CTS Enabled interface ISO shall restrict the scheduling of all\n\nremaining Real-Time Energy Market External Transaction purchases\nsubmitted under Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff.\n\n2. Based on price, dispatchable Generator Assets shall be subject to\n\nDispatch Instructions from the ISO to reduce generation down to\nEmergency Minimum Limits and all External Transaction purchases\nsubmitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that cleared in the DayAhead Energy Market shall be subject to reduction. Such reductions of\ndispatchable Generator Assets and External Transactions submitted\nunder Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff will be applied on a 50/50 basis until\nsupply and demand are matched or the capability of either dispatchable\nGenerator Assets or External Transactions submitted under Section\nIII.1.10.7 of the Tariff to reduce is exhausted. Required reductions will\nthen be taken on the remaining dispatchable Generator Assets or External\nTransaction purchases submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff as\nneeded.\n\n3. If the actions above are not sufficient to match supply to demand, ISO\n\nshall utilize all available information, including but not limited to Minimum\nRun Times or Minimum Down Times and expected capacity conditions for\nthe next Operating Day, recognizing the Pool-Scheduled Resource vs.\nSelf-Scheduled Resource priority, in issuing de-commitment orders.\n\nPurchases will be reduced until the export TTC is reached. The process for\nreducing External Transaction purchases submitted under Section III.1.10.7\nof the Tariff is described in Appendix B to this OP-9.\n\n**C. Operating Reserve Conditions**\n\nWhen scheduling External Transactions for the next scheduling interval, prior\nto implementing actions of OP-4, ISO shall, in the order listed below if\npossible, restrict the scheduling of Real-Time Energy Market External\nTransactions in order to continue to meet load and Operating Reserve\nrequirements:\n\n1. On the CTS-Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of exports submitted\n\nunder Section III.1.10.7A of the Tariff such that the resulting net\ninterchange schedule is not a net export but is a value between zero and\nthe net of the External Transactions that cleared the Day-Ahead Energy\nMarket and subsequently satisfied the day-before checkout process for\nthat scheduling interval, and then\n\n2. On the non CTS-Enabled interfaces, restrict the scheduling of exports\n\nsubmitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that have not cleared the\nDay-Ahead Energy Market for that scheduling interval. After all such\ntransactions have been restricted, out-of-merit import transactions will be\nscheduled to the extent that they are available and can be reliably\nscheduled.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n3. If Phase II is the largest contingency, ISO-NE may reduce the net import\n\non Phase II to the net interchange from the day-before checkout process,\nin accordance with Section III.1.10.7(c) of the Tariff.\n\nFollowing the implementation of OP-4, the steps below will be taken in the\norder listed, to the extent required to meet the Ten-Minute Reserve\nRequirement:\n\n1. On the CTS Enabled interface, restrict the scheduling of remaining Real\nTime Energy Market External Transaction exports submitted under\nSection III.1.10.7A of the Tariff.\n\n2. On the non-CTS interfaces, schedule MP EETs\n\n3. On the non-CTS interfaces, restrict Real-Time Energy Market External\n\nTransaction exports submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff that\nhave cleared the Day-Ahead Energy Market.\n\nExports will be reduced until the import TTC is reached. To the extent\nrestrictions in scheduling External Transactions are required as set forth\nabove, the process for reducing all Real-Time Energy Market External\nTransaction exports submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff is\ndescribed in Appendix B to this OP-9.\n\n**D. Specific Constrained Interface**\n\nRestrictions placed on a specific external interface may be the result of\nconditions directly impacting that interface, conditions internal to ISO, or\nconditions external to ISO. ISO accepts and applies transmission restrictions\nimposed by a TP or Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA)\nexternal to the New England RCA/BAA. Such restrictions shall be\ncommunicated to ISO Operations by the appropriate dispatch organization.\n\n1. Such restrictions may result in:\n\na. Reduction in the net schedule of transactions on the interface; or\n\nb. Reduction in transactions in one direction to maximize flow in the\n\nother direction\n\n2. External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7 of the Tariff will be\n\nscheduled to the restriction in accordance with the rules defined in Section\nII.44.1 of the Tariff.\n\n3. External Transactions submitted under Section III.1.10.7.A of the Tariff will\n\nbe scheduled to the restriction in accordance with the rules defined in\nSection II.44.2 of the OATT.\n\n**E. NBSO to ISO-NE Security Energy Transactions**\n\nThis section addresses provisions for ISO to preserve minimum flows on the\nKeene Rd-Keswick (3001) tie line and Orrington- Point Lepreau (390/3016) tie\nline in accordance with the applicable ISO / New Brunswick Power System\nOperator (NBP-SO) transmission operating guide.\n\nThe New England RCA/BAA and New Brunswick RCA/BAA both share a joint\nInterconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) related to minimum flow\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\nrequirements on the New Brunswick - New England transmission interface. At\ninfrequent intervals, the flow on the interface is insufficient from north to south\nto provide acceptable steady-state and transient performance of the Maine\nsystem and reliable performance of the 3001 and the 390/3016 lines on a postcontingency basis. ISO takes the lead role in determining the requirements and\ncoordinating operations between the RCAs/BAAs to avoid violations or correct\nexceedances. In order to avoid a violation or correct an exceedance, both\nparties take corrective action(s) using no-cost methods first. However, if after\nexhausting such no-cost methods, an exceedance or potential violation still\nexists, ISO takes the following actions, as necessary and in the following order,\nin coordination with MPs and the NBP-SO to avoid a violation or correct an\nexceedance of the minimum flow requirement:\n\n1. Reduce exports from New England to New Brunswick\n\n2. Schedule External Transactions, including MP submitted Security Energy\n\nTransactions (SETs) for the next scheduling interval to the required MW\nlevel, based on economics, from all available offers in sufficient quantity to\ncorrect the potential or actual violation.\n\n3. Schedule Control Area to Control Area SETs to satisfy the minimum flow\n\nrequirement\n\n**F. Local Area Capacity Deficient Conditions**\n\nWhen a local area capacity deficient condition within the ISO RCA occurs or is\nprojected and restricting External Transaction exports will prevent or improve\nthe condition, then reductions shall be implemented, to the extent required, in\naccordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.\n\nH d C I U ll d\n\n\n-----\n\n**V.** **CURTAILMENT OF EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS**\n\nISO is prepared to curtail any External Transactions that have been implemented\nfor physical flow across an external interface if necessary to maintain system\nreliability. There are different circumstances under which transactions may be\ncurtailed, depending on the effect on the power system, and on the particular\nexternal interface involved. All curtailments are determined in a nondiscriminatory manner and an appropriate reason is indicated in the electronic\nnotification of the curtailment.\n\n**A. Minimum Generation Conditions**\n\nIf Minimum Generation conditions arise that must be addressed within a\nscheduling interval, the process described in Section IV of this OP shall be\napplied to determine the MW amount of External Transactions that shall be\ncurtailed. Any required curtailment of External Transactions shall be\nimplemented in accordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.\n\n**B. Operating Reserve Conditions**\n\nIf a deficiency in Operating Reserves occurs or is forecast to occur within a\nscheduling interval, the process described in Section IV of this OP shall be\napplied to determine which External Transactions shall be curtailed. Any\nrequired curtailment of External Transactions shall be implemented in\naccordance with Appendix B to this OP-9.\n\n**C. Specific Constrained Interface**\n\nIf a condition occurs that creates a restriction on an external interface within a\nscheduling interval, ISO shall:\n\n1.

WHEN SHEDDING LOAD NEW ENGLAND WIDE:\n\n**A. Communication With Local Control Centers (LCCs)**\n\nAn ISO System Operator[1] (ISO) shall use the “ALL LCCs” telephone function when\nissuing Operating Instructions[2] to all LCCs.\n\n**B. Quantity of Load**\n\nISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction with the quantity of load to be shed or\nrestored by specifying a percent of area load.\n\nPercent = Total MW Load to be Shed or Restored x 100\n\nInstantaneous New England Load\n\nThe identified Percent should be rounded up to the next whole number to determine the\nvalue used in the load shed Operating Instruction.\n\nThe identified Percent should be rounded down to the next whole number to determine\nthe value used in the load restoration Operating Instruction.\n\n**C. Implementation Messages**\n\nISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction and shall await LCC repeat back, which\nshould be received from each LCC in alphabetical order. ISO shall acknowledge each\nLCC repeat back of the Operating Instruction as correct or reissue the Operating\nInstruction.\n\nTypical messages are as follows:\n\nOperating Instruction by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually shed X percent of area load.”\n\nor\n2. ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually restore X percent of area load.”\n\nAcknowledgments by each LCC:\n\n1. Each LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually shed X percent of area load.”\n\nor\n2. Each LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually restore X percent of area load.”\n\nAcknowledgment by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to each LCC: “That is correct.”\n\n(If a misunderstanding occurs, ISO shall reissue the Operating Instruction.)\n\n**D. Examples**\n\nTypical load shedding implementation Operating Instruction and acknowledgment\nmessages\n\nAssumed Conditions:\n\n1 System Operator is defined in the “Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards” and when\n\nused in this Procedure the term ISO specifically refers to an ISO System Operator.\n\n2 Operating Instruction is defined in the NERC Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstantaneous New England Load = 21,400 MW\n\nNEED: Shed 500 MW uniformly throughout New England.\n\nCalculation result: 50,000 / 21,400 = 2.3%\n\nPercent load shed: 2.3% rounded up to the next whole number = 3%\n\nMessages:\n\nOperating Instruction by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually shed 3 percent of area load.”\n\nAcknowledgment by LCCs:\n\n1. CONVEX to all: “OP-7, manually shed 3 percent of area load.”\n\n2.

ISO to all LCCs: “Implement OP-7, manually restore 2 percent of area load.”\n\nAcknowledgment by each LCC:\n\n2. CONVEX to all: “OP-7, manually restore 2 percent of area load.”\n\n(Other LCCs respond in alphabetical order)\n\nAcknowledgment by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to all LCCs: “That is correct.”\n\n(If a misunderstanding occurs, ISO shall reissue the Operating Instruction.)\n\n\n-----\n\n### II. WHEN SHEDDING LOAD IN INDIVIDUAL LCC AREA(S)\n\n**A. Communication With LCC(s)**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nAn affected LCC is an LCC that is within the area in which load shedding will be effective in\nalleviating a problem.\n\nISO shall individually contact each affected LCC and issue a concise Operating\nInstruction. When each affected LCC has been contacted, ISO shall contact each\nunaffected LCC individually and inform each LCC of the situation.\n\n**B. Quantity of Load to be Shed or Restored**\n\nISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction with the quantity of load to be shed or\nrestored by specifying a (MW) amount. If required, the affected LCC System Operator\nshall convert the MW amount into a percent value.\n\n**C. Affected LCC Implementation Messages**\n\nISO shall issue a concise Operating Instruction to each affected LCC and receive an\naccurate acknowledgment or reissue the Operating Instruction. Typical messages are\nas follows:\n\nOperating Instruction by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to the affected LCC: “Implement OP-7, manually shed (___) MW of load.”\n\nor\n\n2. ISO to the affected LCC: “Implement OP-7, manually restore (___) MW of load.”\n\nAcknowledgment by Affected LCC:\n\n1. Affected LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually shed (___) MW of load.”\n\nor\n\n2. Affected LCC to ISO: “OP-7, manually restore (___) MW of load.”\n\nAcknowledgment by ISO:\n\n1. ISO to the affected LCC: “That is correct.”\n\n(If a misunderstanding occurs, ISO shall reissue the Operating Instruction.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**D. Examples**\n\nTypical implementation Operating Instruction and acknowledgment messages\n\nAssumed Conditions:\n\nNEED: Shed 200 MW of load in CONVEX.\n\nMessages:\n\nOperating Instruction by ISO:\n\n1.

This OP may be implemented any time one\nor more of the following events, or other similar events, occur or are expected to occur:\n\n  - The Resources available to the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/\n\nBalancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) outside of OP-4 are insufficient to meet the\nanticipated load plus Operating Reserve requirements. This OP will not be\nimplemented to maintain Replacement Reserve requirements.\n\n  - One or more contingencies have occurred resulting in an immediate deficiency in\n\nthe New England RCA/BAA available capacity Resources required to meet the\nload plus Operating Reserve requirements.\n\n  - Transmission facilities into a sub-area of the New England RCA/BAA are loaded\n\nbeyond established transfer capabilities.\n\n  - A sub-area of the New England RCA/BAA is experiencing abnormal voltage\n\nand/or reactive conditions.\n\n  - The need to implement manual load shedding as required by ISO New England\n\nOperating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7) is imminent but load\nshedding may be avoided, or reduced in magnitude, by implementation of this\nOP.\n\n  - Another Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) RCA/BAA, or a\n\nremote system or pool, is experiencing a capacity deficiency and has requested\nassistance from ISO, which, if provided, would reduce the New England\nRCA/BAA actual Operating Reserve below the required levels.\n\n  - Any other serious threat to the integrity of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for\n\nwhich ISO determines that this OP would mitigate the impact.\n\nAppendix A - Estimates Of Additional Generation And Load Relief From System Wide\nImplementation Of Actions In ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action\nDuring A Capacity Deficiency Based On A 25,000 MW System Load contains an\nestimate of the additional generation and load relief, which may be achieved through\nimplementation of the Actions specified in this OP.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PART II - PROCEDURE**\n\n**I.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **BY** **ISO** **NEW** **ENGLAND**\n\nISO shall alert each LCC and Market Participant (MP) promptly any time one or\nmore of the events described in Part I of this OP are anticipated, or have actually\noccurred, and implementation of this procedure may be required. ISO shall also\nalert each surrounding Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA) and\ncoordinate with these RCs/BAs in accordance with NPCC Directory #5 Reserve.\nThe alert shall be issued in accordance with Master/Local Control Center\nProcedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert (M/LCC 2). Upon implementation of\nOP-4, ISO shall notify each LCC of the OP-4 Actions required by number. ISO and\neach LCC shall initiate Actions according to the authority and responsibility\nassigned in this OP. To the extent possible, ISO will continue to dispatch\nResources in accordance with Section III of the ISO New England Inc.\nTransmission, Markets and Services Tariff (Tariff), while ensuring reliability in the\nNew England RCA/BAA during implementation of OP-4.\n\nActions of OP-4 shall be implemented to the extent required to manage Operating\nReserve Requirements, in accordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure\nNo. 8 - Operating Reserve and Regulation (OP-8) and/or to provide necessary\ndispatch options during abnormal conditions.\n\n**ACTION 1 (An ISO responsibility)**\n\nISO shall notify all Resources that a capacity deficiency exists. Each Resource\nwith a Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) shall prepare to provide all associated\noperable capability.\n\nISO shall notify via the “Notices” section of the ISO external website that each\nSettlement Only Resource with Real-Time obligations and a CSO should be\nmonitoring the status of the reserve pricing and is required to meet its obligation\nunder the “Capacity Scarcity Condition” definitions in Section III of the Tariff.\n\nBegin to allow the depletion of Thirty-Minute Operating Reserve.\n\nImplement a Power Caution.\n\n**ACTION 2 (An ISO responsibility)**\n\nDeclare Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 1.[1]\n\n**ACTION 3 (ISO responsible for Designated Entities and Demand**\n**Designated Entities, LCCs for office complexes.)**\n\nRequest voluntary load curtailment of MP facilities in the New England\nRCA/BAA.\n\n1 EEA Levels are described in Attachment 1 to NERC Reliability Standard EOP-011 - Emergency Preparedness and\nOperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ACTION 4 (An ISO responsibility)**\n\nImplement a Power Watch.\n\nISO will normally implement Action 5 and beyond of this OP to maintain TenMinute Reserve.\n\n**ACTION 5 (An ISO responsibility)**\n\nArrange to purchase available emergency capacity and energy, or energy only,\n(if capacity backing is not available) from MPs or neighboring RCAs/BAAs.\nControl Area-to-Control Area emergency transactions will normally be used as a\nlast resort, when market-based Emergency Energy transactions are not\navailable, or not available in a timely fashion.\n\nAction 6 shall be implemented to the extent required to maintain Ten-Minute\nReserve, in accordance with OP-8, and to enable ISO to better cope with possible\ncontinuing and deteriorating abnormal operating conditions.\n\n**ACTION 6 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**\n\nImplement a voltage reduction of five percent (5%) of normal operating voltage\nrequiring more than 10 minutes to implement.\n\nDeclare Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 2.\n\nIn addition, ISO shall begin to count the manual load shedding capability\navailable as part of OP-7 to meet its Disturbance Control Standard\nrequirements.\n\n**ACTION** **7 (ISO responsibility)**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe following request will be made on a forecast basis when ISO anticipates it will be\nunable to maintain Ten-Minute Reserve or in Real-Time based on the current\noperating conditions\n\nRequest Generators and Demand Response Resources (DRRs) not subject to\na CSO to voluntarily provide energy for reliability purposes.\n\nAction 8 shall be implemented to maintain adequate Ten-Minute Reserve in the\nNew England RCA/BAA. The amount to be maintained will be determined based\non actual system conditions at the time of the deficiency or the need to aid another\nNPCC RCA/BAA in accordance with NPCC Directory #5 Reserve.\n\n**ACTION 8 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**\n\nImplement a voltage reduction of five percent (5%) of normal operating voltage\nthat is attainable within 10 minutes.\n\nDeclare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.\n\n\n-----\n\nActions 9, 10 and 11 will normally be implemented by ISO through the LCCs based\nupon advance projections made by ISO that it will not be possible to maintain\nadequate Ten-Minute Reserve by implementing Actions 1 through 8. When\nActions 9 and 10 are requested, the particular hours that they are to be\nimplemented will be specified by ISO. Actions 9, 10, and 11 should be\nimplemented as early as possible to achieve maximum benefit.\n\n**ACTION 9 (LCC responsibility)**\n\nRequest all of the customer generation not contractually available to MPs.\nRequest voluntary load curtailment by large industrial and commercial\ncustomers.\n\n**ACTION 10 (An ISO and LCC responsibility)**\n\nInitiate radio and television appeals for voluntary load curtailment.\n\nImplement a Power Warning.\n\nDeclare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.\n\nDepending on the circumstances and the time required to institute certain of the\nabove Actions, it may be necessary to call for some Actions simultaneously, or\nto alter the order of Action initiations. When all of the above Actions have been\ntaken, further action, if required, is covered under OP-7\n\nIt may be necessary to implement OP-7, prior to the implementation of all of the\nabove Actions. If, at any time during implementation of the above Actions, it\nappears that implementation of OP-7 will be required; ISO shall notify each\nLCC.\n\nWhen Action 11 is requested, the particular hours this Action is to be implemented\nwill be specified by the ISO.\n\n**ACTION 11 (An ISO responsibility)**\n\nRequest each New England state Governor to reinforce Power Warning\nappeals, as initiated in Action 10.\n\nDeclare EEA Level 2, if not already performed in an earlier action.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II.** **CANCELLATION** **OF** **ACTIONS**\n\nWhen the system conditions have sufficiently improved, ISO shall cancel the\nActions instituted in this OP Section I. Depending on system conditions, the order\nof Action cancellation may be different than the order of Action initiation.\n\n**III.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **BY** **LCCS**\n\nAny of the Actions provided in this OP may be implemented by an LCC to deal with\nlocal conditions within that LCC’s territory. The severity of the condition will\ndetermine the Actions taken. ISO shall review LCC implementation of this OP to\nverify that the implementation is consistent with Section III of the Tariff and ISO\nManuals.\n\n**IV.** **COMMUNICATIONS**\n\nISO shall inform all LCCs simultaneously of system conditions and issue an\nimplementation Operating Instruction. Each LCC, in alphabetical order, shall\nrepeat the Operating Instruction back to ISO, to provide acknowledgment. When\neach LCC completes implementation of an Action, the LCC shall report\nimplementation of the Action has been completed and the time that Action was\ncompleted, to ISO. These communications will be performed per the\ncommunications protocol required by NERC Reliability Standard COM-002 and as\nstated in M/LCC No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices.\n\nEach LCC shall be responsible for keeping its member companies and ISO\ninformed of all situations pertaining to implementation and cancellation of the\nActions of this OP. ISO shall make notifications to the Department of Energy as\nrequired. Each LCC shall make notifications to state regulatory agencies as\nrequired. ISO shall issue a report to the appropriate New England Power Pool\n(NEPOOL) Technical Committee(s) following implementation of this OP, within 3\nBusiness Days of the implementation.\n\n**V.** **IMPLEMENTATION** **OF** **AN** **ALERT**\n\nISO Control Room staff shall notify, as appropriate, each LCC, Designated Entity\n(DE), and Demand Designated Entity (DDE) as soon as OP-4 conditions are\nanticipated or underway by executing its responsibilities as declared by M/LCC 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n**VI.** **PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS**\n\nNotifications associated with forecast or actual implementation of OP-4 shall be\nconducted in accordance with CROP.10002 Implement Capacity Remedial Actions.\nPower Advisories shall be issued by ISO via its external website. These Power\nAdvisories shall be triggered by the implementation of certain Actions of OP-4 as\ndescribed below. These notifications are considered public information.\n\nPower Caution\n\nA Power Caution is triggered by the initial implementation of OP-4 Action 1. A\nPower Caution is defined as a notification that electric reserves can no longer\nbe maintained using normal measures. Although full reserves are not being\nmaintained, utility personnel will begin to take steps to manage these reserves.\n\nPower Watch\n\nA Power Watch is triggered by the implementation of OP-4 Action 4. A Power\nWatch is defined as a notification that further steps to manage capacity could\naffect the public.\n\nPower Warning\n\nA Power Warning is triggered by the implementation of OP-4 Action 10. A\nPower Warning is defined as a notification for public appeals when an\nimmediate reduction in power usage is necessary to avert overload of the\nelectrical system. Public appeals are made when other efforts (e.g., emergency\npurchases, voluntary curtailment, contracted curtailment and voltage reduction)\nhave been unsuccessful in bringing supply and demand back into balance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OP-4 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to**\nthe RTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO\nOperations Date.)\n\n|Rev.

INTRODUCTION**\n\nThis Operating Procedure (OP) establishes the process for a Market Participant (MP) to\nrequest a Planned Outage (PO), Maintenance Outage (MO), or Overrun Planned Outage\n(OPO) for a generator, Demand Response Resource (DRR), Dispatchable Asset Related\nDemand (DARD), or Alternative Technology Regulation Resource (ATRR). This OP also\nestablishes the process for ISO New England (ISO) and the relevant Local Control Center\n(LCC) to evaluate PO and MO requests, and for ISO to approve or deny such requests.\n\nThis OP is designed to facilitate the scheduling of POs and MOs/OPOs for an MP’s\ngenerator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR and to allow:\n\n(1) each MP to incorporate future maintenance in its budget forecasts;\n\n(2) sufficient time for an MP to respond to market signals; and\n\n(3) sufficient time for ISO and the relevant LCC to assess the impact of each generator,\nDRR, DARD, or ATRR outage request on the reliability of the New England Reliability\nCoordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA)[1] and the New England\nTransmission System.\n\nEach MP shall, to the fullest extent practicable, maintain and operate all generators,\nDRRs, DARDs, or ATRRs that it owns or controls in accordance with Good Utility Practice.\nAn MP shall not take a generator, DRR, DARD, ATRR, or Qualified Generator Reactive\nResource out-of-service for maintenance without ISO approval, unless there is a danger to\npersonnel or a risk of equipment damage (except for generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR\noutages where a Capacity Supply Obligation (CSO) is not impacted or where there is no\nCSO). If a generator, DRR, DARD or ATRR is forced out-of-service due to personnel or\nequipment risk, the ISO Control Room Generation Operator and Forecaster shall be\nnotified as soon as possible. ISO shall categorize an outage not approved by ISO as a\nForced Outage (FO). An MP shall request a PO, MO, or OPO with as much advance\nnotice as possible in order to prevent an FO.\n\n**A. PO, MO, and OPO Requests**\n\nAn MP shall submit a request for a PO, MO, or OPO when:\n\n     - the PO, MO, or OPO of the Resource impacts the CSO of the associated\n\ncapacity Resource;\n\n     - the request is associated with a Resource without a CSO that is a qualified\n\nReactive Resource;\n\n     - the PO, MO, or OPO of the DRR is for 5 MW or more and results in the\n\nassociated Active Demand Capacity Resource (ADCR) falling short of its CSO by\n5 MW or more (the DRR is the unit that is dispatched in the energy market, but\nthe ADCR has the CSO); or\n\n1  Reliability Coordinator Area and Balancing Authority Area are defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC\n\nReliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\n   - a PO, MO, or OPO would reduce the ability of a DARD to interrupt without\n\nreducing its load by a corresponding amount.\n\nThe requirements for PO requests are detailed in Section III.B of this OP. The\nrequirements for MO and OPO requests are detailed in Section III.C of this OP.\n\n**B. DRR**\n\nAn MP shall submit an outage request for a DRR in accordance with this OP if the\nDRR’s offered maximum reduction will be reduced by 5 MW or more, the DRR is\nassociated with an ADCR, and the impact of the DRR’s reduced availability will result\nin the associated ADCR falling short of its CSO by 5 MW or more. When there is more\nthan one DRR associated with an ADCR, the impact from the reduced availability of a\nDRR on the ADCR’s CSO is determined by summing the offered maximum reductions\nof all of the DRRs that are associated with that ADCR. If the sum of the offered\nmaximum reductions of all the DRRs associated with the ADCR will fall short of the\nCSO by 5 MW or more, and if a single DRR’s maximum reduction will be reduced by 5\nMW or more, the MP shall be required to report the outage to ISO. (The maximum\nreduction to be used shall be for the expected peak hour of the Operating Day.)\n\n**C. DARD**\n\nAn MP shall not reduce the ability for a DARD to interrupt to its Nominated\nConsumption Limit (NCL) without ISO approval unless there is a danger to personnel\nor a risk of equipment damage. An MP that reduces the ability for a DARD to interrupt\ndue to danger to personnel or a risk of equipment damage shall notify the ISO Control\nRoom Generation Operator and Forecaster of the reduction as soon as practicable.\n\n**D. ATRR**\n\nWhen a PO, MO, or OPO would reduce the ability of an ATRR that is modeled in the\nISO topology to provide the registered Regulation capability for more than 24\ncontinuous hours, the MP shall submit a request for the PO, MO, or OPO.\n\n**E. Intermittent Power Resources**\n\nThe process for submitting and evaluating PO, MO, and OPO requests for Intermittent\nPower Resources shall be the same as for Resources.\n\n**F. Relay Protection Systems**\n\nAn MP shall submit a request for any planned or unplanned testing or maintenance\noutage of a relay protection system that could reduce or impact the normal operation\nof the New England RCA/BAA or the New England Transmission System in\naccordance with ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 24 - Protection Outages,\nSettings and Coordination (OP-24). The scheduling requirements are designed to\nallow sufficient time for ISO and each relevant LCC to assess the impact on reliability\nof each protection outage request.\n\n**G. Notification of PO or MO When CSO is Not Impacted/There is No CSO**\n\n\n-----\n\nAn MP shall notify ISO of each generator PO or MO that does not impact the CSO of\nthe associated capacity Resource or that is associated with a Resource that does not\nhave a CSO.\n\nThe MP shall categorize and report each Resource outage to ISO in accordance with\nthe NERC Generating Availability Data System (GADS) - Data Reporting Instructions\nand this OP.\n\n**H. ISO Coordination of POs and MOs/OPOs**\n\nWhenever possible, ISO shall coordinate any transmission, generator, DRR and\nDARD POs, MOs and OPOs to reduce Congestion Costs. For an importing area, ISO\nshall evaluate requested POs, MOs, and OPOs for any economic generator, DRR or\nDARD within the area simultaneously with transmission facilities that significantly\nsupport area import capability. For an exporting area, ISO shall coordinate any\ngenerator, DRR, and DARD outage within the area coincident with outages of\ntransmission facilities that significantly support area export capabilities.\n\n**I.** **Import Capacity Resources**\n\nThe MP shall notify the ISO if there is a reduction in capability that impacts the CSO of\nan Import Capacity Resource backed by one or more Resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n**II. DEFINITIONS**\n\n**Annual Maintenance Schedule (AMS) is a capacity assessment report provided and**\n\nupdated by the ISO Long Term Outage Coordination group on a daily basis. This\ncapacity assessment is intended to convey forecasted capacity margins in order to\ncoordinate Resource and transmission outages in a reliable manner. Providing this\nreport with two years of forecast capacity margins affords sufficient lead-time to\nschedule Planned Outages (POs) for the current and future Capacity Commitment\nPeriods (CCPs).\n\n**Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM) is a measure of the long-term projected**\n\nweekly operable capacity margin on a New England sub-area basis, as described in\nOP-5 Appendix A – Operable Capacity Calculations (OP-5A). The sub-area analysis is\nforecast for up to nineteen (19) months and is performed in addition to the operable\ncapacity margin analysis for the entire New England RCA/BAA.\n\n**Long-Term Operable Capacity Margin (LTOCM) is a measure of New England**\n\nRCA/BAA projected weekly operable capacity margin looking ahead up to twenty-four\n(24) months based on the assumptions in OP-5A. A positive value of LTOCM\nindicates a potential surplus of operable capacity over and above the estimated load\nplus Operating Reserve requirement. The LTOCM formula and its components are\ndefined in OP-5A.\n\n**Operable Capacity Margin (OCM) is, collectively, the Long Term Operable Capacity**\n\nMargin (LTOCM), the Locational Operable Capacity Margin (LOCM), the Short Term\nOperable Capacity Margin (STOCM), and the Short Term Locational Operable\nCapacity Margin (STLOCM).\n\n**Outage Types:**\n\n**Forced Outage (FO) is any outage or inability, in whole or in part, of a Resource to**\n\nprovide its claimed capability or NCL, or any DRR outage as described in Section\nI.B above, that has not been approved by ISO in the form of a PO or MO. An FO\nincident preceding a PO or MO shall not eliminate the requirement of the MP to\nreport an FO for the entire actual/estimated period to repair the component(s)\nassociated with the FO. Among other things, an FO may occur by reason of an\nEmergency or threatened Emergency, unanticipated failure, or other cause beyond\nthe control of the owner or operator of the facility, as specified in the relevant\nportions of Section III of the Tariff and ISO New England Manuals.\n\n**Maintenance Outage (MO) (identified as “Short-Term Outage” in the ISO outage**\n\n**software) is an outage that can be deferred beyond the end of the weekend, but**\nrequires that the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR be removed from service within\n14 calendar days of the outage start date. During any particular week, if an MP\nrequests an outage that cannot be deferred beyond the weekend, that outage shall\nbe classified as a Forced Outage. ISO shall attempt to, in accordance with the\nrequest, accommodate an MO as soon as possible depending on system\nconditions, significant increases in Locational Marginal Price (LMP), and\nCongestion Costs. This outage is coordinated in the MO request processes.\nCharacteristically, an MO can occur any time during the year, has a flexible start\n\n\n-----\n\ndate, may or may not have a predetermined duration. Typically, these Resource\noutages are less than 14 days in duration.\n\n**Overrun Planned Outage (OPO) is an overrun of a PO that may be requested up until**\nthe Thursday, or the week prior to, the scheduled return of a generator, DRR, or DARD, or\nATRR to service. An OPO is considered a type of MO throughout this document. The\noutage must be limited to the original Planned Outage work scope and must not be\nrequested for newly discovered issues (a new request shall be submitted for newly\ndiscovered work).\n\n**Planned Outage (PO) is an outage that must be requested with a minimum of 15**\n\ncalendar days prior to start date and is typically scheduled for the purpose of\nperforming annual maintenance or more significant work that is planned and\ncoordinated well in advance.\n\n**Owner Test Request is a request that must be submitted to ISO when the MP has owner**\n\ntesting to perform and wants to ensure their generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR will be\nable to operate at a predefined schedule during that testing. If a request for owner\ntesting is not submitted by an MP, transmission outages may be approved that could\nprevent the desired testing from occurring in the desired period. The MP shall submit\nand ISO shall evaluate an Owner Test request in the same manner as an MO request.\n\n**Reactive Capability Audit Request (RCAR) is a request submitted to ISO when an MP**\n\nhas testing that will result in injection or absorption of a specific reactive power value\nfrom the Resource. The RCAR shall be submitted to ISO in accordance with ISO New\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing. The MP shall submit the\noutage as MVAr testing and ISO shall evaluate the RCAR in the same manner as an\nMO request, except that ISO shall respond to the RCAR within the time frame\ndesignated in the Response Time Table below.\n\n**Short-Term Locational Operable Capacity Margin (STLOCM) is a measure of the**\n\nprojected daily operable capacity margin looking ahead 2 weeks or less on a New\nEngland sub-area basis, as described in OP-5A.\n\n**Short-Term Operable Capacity Margin (STOCM) is a measure of New England**\n\nRCA/BAA projected daily operable capacity margin looking ahead 2 weeks or less\nbased on the assumptions in OP-5A. A positive value of STOCM indicates a potential\nsurplus of operable capacity over and above the estimated load plus Operating\nReserve requirement. The STOCM formula and its components are defined in OP-5A.\n\n**Sub-Area is a local area within the New England RCA/BAA requiring coordination of**\n\ngenerator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR and transmission outages.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this OP shall have the meanings ascribed to\n\nthem in the Tariff.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III. PROCEDURES**\n\n**A. ISO** **&** **LCC** **RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**1. General**\n\na. Evaluation Principles\n\nISO shall assign each outage request an outage tracking number, upon receipt.\nEach request shall be time- and date-stamped for prioritization purposes.\n\nISO and the LCC shall evaluate each generator, DRR, or DARD outage\nrequest submitted by a Lead MP for the items listed below. Outages of\ntransmission facilities shall be included as a part of this evaluation. Criteria\ncontained in this Section III.A.1 pertain to each generator/DRR/DARD outage\nthat impacts the CSO of the associated capacity Resource. ISO and the LCC\nshall conduct their evaluation as follows:\n\ni. Identify if the proposed Resource outage results in an unacceptable\nOCM.\n\nii. Identify if the proposed generator, DRR, or DARD outage results in\nany system or local system reliability impacts.\n\niii. Identify opportunities where the proposed generator, DRR, or DARD\noutage could be adjusted with respect to a pending transmission\noutage to reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs.\n\n**2. PO Review Moratorium**\n\na. Annual Forward Capacity Market (FCM) Reliability Review\n\nDuring the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of the results of the\nthird annual reconfiguration auction results for the applicable FCM Capacity\nCommitment Period, ISO shall time-stamp PO requests for outages that fall within\nJune 1 and September 15 of the FCM Capacity Commitment Period to establish\nreview priority and hold until the third annual reconfiguration auction results\nreliability review is completed.\n\nb. Monthly FCM Reliability Review\n\nDuring the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM monthly CSO\nbilateral submissions and monthly reconfiguration auction results for the applicable\nmonth, ISO shall time-stamp each PO request for an outage that falls within the\napplicable month to establish review priority, and hold until the reliability review\nprocess is completed.\n\n**3. Outage Request Approval Principles**\n\nThe MP shall request ISO approval to remove a generator, DRR, or DARD from\nservice for a PO or MO in accordance with this OP when that generator, DRR or\n\n\n-----\n\nDARD outage may impact the CSO of the associated capacity Resource. When\nthe generator, DRR or DARD outage does not impact the CSO of the associated\ncapacity Resource, the MP shall provide notification to ISO in accordance with this\nOP.\n\nISO shall approve any PO or MO request to the extent that it would not, in ISO or\nLCC judgment, cause an unacceptable OCM or violate any NERC, Northeast\nPower Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC), or ISO operating criteria, policy or\nprocedure. Once approved, an MP shall not subsequently be required to alter its\nPO request if unacceptable OCM conditions arise as a result of another\ngenerator/DRR/DARD or transmission outage. However, ISO may delay the start\nof an outage for reliability reasons.\n\nISO shall prioritize the outage requests for any given time period on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis.\n\nISO may reject an outage request if, in ISO judgment, the requested outage would\ncause an unacceptable LTOCM or LOCM (as defined in Section III.B.1.b of this\nOP) or STOCM or STLOCM (as defined in Section III.C.1.b of this OP).\n\nISO shall coordinate with the LCCs regarding any outage repositioning. The daily\nposting of the “Annual Maintenance Schedule” (AMS) shall provide the LCCs with\ninformation regarding any repositioned outages occurring later in the year. For an\nMO request, ISO provides the relevant LCC with the outage information. The LCC\nshall notify ISO if an outage repositioning poses any local system reliability impact\nwithin its local area. Additionally, to reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs, the\nLCCs and ISO shall promote the continuous flow of information between them and\nthe Transmission Owners (TOs) in an effort to match proposed generator, DRR, or\nDARD POs or FOs with pending transmission outage work to the extent\npracticable.\n\n**B. PLANNED** **OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **AND** **EVALUATION** **PROCESS**\n\nWhere the PO request affects the CSO of associated capacity Resource, or of the\nassociated ADCR as described in Section I.B, or is associated with a generator\nwithout a CSO that is a qualified Reactive Resource, an MP shall request ISO\napproval to schedule a PO in accordance with this OP. Where the generator PO\nrequest does not affect the CSO of the associated capacity Resource or is associated\nwith a generator that does not have a CSO, the MP shall notify ISO of its PO schedule\nin accordance with this OP.\n\n**1. PO Request Processing**\n\na. ISO and the respective LCC shall respond to MP PO requests on a first\ncome, first-served basis for any defined submittal period. The respective\nLCC shall review the PO request and continue the requested PO\nprogression for ISO review if the impact on local reliability within its area is\nacceptable.\n\nb. ISO shall evaluate the impact of the PO request on the OCM (as defined in\n\n\n-----\n\nOP-5A) and evaluate if approved transmission outages would interfere with\nthe PO request. A PO shall not be approved if the security analysis\nconsidering all approved transmission network element outage identifies a\nviolation(s) of ISO, LCC, NERC or NPCC criteria.\n\nc. If ISO determines that the requested PO is not acceptable, then ISO shall\n\ndiscuss with the LCC, alternative dates when the system reliability\nconditions are projected to be more favorable. The LCC shall work with the\nTO and the generator, DRR, or DARD MP to reposition the PO. If the MP is\nnot willing or not able to move the PO to a period where capacity and\nsecurity criteria can be met, the PO request shall be denied.\n\nd. In an effort to reduce Congestion Costs, ISO shall also compare the\n\ngenerator, DRR, or DARD PO request against approved transmission\noutage schedules to identify cases where the generator, DRR, or DARD PO\nschedules could be adjusted to meet this objective. If a potential schedule\nadjustment is identified, ISO shall discuss PO rescheduling with the LCC.\nThe LCC shall coordinate rescheduling with the respective TO and the\ngenerator, DRR, or DARD MP. (Throughout this process, ISO shall work\nwith the respective LCC, as needed, to develop alternative PO schedules.)\n\ne. Upon coordination of generator, DRR, or DARD PO and transmission outage\n\nschedules, ISO shall perform its final review to confirm that the New\nEngland RCA/BAA and LCC reliability requirements are satisfied,\ncoordination actions are in order, and Congestion Costs have been reduced\nor eliminated. Following this review, ISO shall:\n\ni. Notify the MP if its request is approved as submitted, or approved with\n\nmodifications in accordance with this OP.\n\nii. Publish the PO in the next update of the AMS.\n\n**2. ISO Reporting**\n\nISO shall publish the current AMS, to the ISO external website daily. If the\npublished AMS poses any local system reliability impact within its local area,\neach LCC shall notify ISO’s Long Term Outage Coordination staff by electronic\n[media (email) at opamoreq@iso-ne.com within five (5) Business Days. [Local](mailto:opamoreq@isone.com)\nsystem reliability issues identified at this point should be minimal since each\ngenerator, DRR, or DARD PO request is forwarded to the respective LCC(s) for\nlocal review and approval following ISO’s initial evaluation.]\n\nISO shall aggregate approved MP PO requests, and ISO shall provide the\nprojected weekly LTOCM for the New England RCA/BAA for two (2)\nconsecutive calendar years. This process provides the MPs with a planning\ntool for reviewing their maintenance requirements and timing of their own\noperable capacity needs with the market signals of the New England\nRCA/BAA. This process provides ISO with a method for coordinating\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerator, DRR, or DARD maintenance requirements to avoid OP-4 or OP-7\nactions, and as a result, ISO can identify potential capacity-deficient periods.\nAdditionally, the process provides ISO and the LCCs with the necessary\ninformation to identify situations where generator, DRR, or DARD and\ntransmission outages could potentially be coordinated to reduce Congestion\nCosts.\n\n**3. Resolution of a Reliability Issue**\n\nIf ISO determines that a reliability issue exists after it has approved a PO that is\nreflected in the AMS, ISO shall work with the LCC and the MP to reposition a\npreviously-approved generator, DRR, or DARD PO to avoid or eliminate\nunacceptable forecasted LTOCM, LOCM, or reliability issues that have arisen\nsince that approval was granted.\n\nWhere a reliability issue cannot be eliminated through ISO discussions with the\naffected MP by seventy-five (75) calendar days prior to the start of the reliability\nissue, ISO shall perform the following steps in order:\n\na. Within seventy-five (75) calendar days of the reliability issue, ISO shall\n\nnotify, in writing, all MPs that have requested a PO during the period where\nan unacceptable LTOCM or LOCM is projected and request that all MPs\neither voluntarily reposition their PO request or provide ISO with alternatives\nfor repositioning their PO request. The MPs shall have fifteen (15)\nBusiness Days to respond to the ISO request.\n\nb. If the problem is not resolved within 30 calendar days of written notification\n\nof the reliability issue to the MPs, the ISO may reject one or all of the PO\nrequests as described in this OP. In making its determination, ISO shall\ngroup the requests by time-stamp, and then apply an allocation method.\nThe ISO allocation method is used to allocate the capacity available for a\nPO. ISO shall notify the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Markets\nCommittee that the problem exists, that voluntary repositioning has not\nresolved the problem, and that ISO must implement an allocation process.\n\nThe allocation process starts with the most recent group of PO requests.\nThe allocation method is based on the ratio of a requesting MP’s total\ngenerating CSO and DARD NCL compared to the sum of the requesting\ngroup total generating CSO and DARD NCL. This ratio is multiplied by the\ncapacity available for maintenance to determine the MP allocation.\nPreviously-approved PO requests shall not be subjected to the allocation\nprocess. If the MP allocation represents at least ninety percent (90%) of the\ngenerating CSO or a DARD NCL to be removed from service, ISO shall\napprove the PO request. If the MP allocation represents less than ninety\npercent (90%) of the generator, DRR, or DARD capacity to be removed\nfrom service, the generator, DRR, or DARD outage shall be relocated. ISO\nshall notify the MPs of the result of the allocation process no later than 55\ncalendar days prior to the start of any PO.\n\nc. Following ISO imposition of the allocation method and by forty-five (45)\n\n\n-----\n\ncalendar days prior to the commencement of a PO, if any MP refuses to\nrelocate its generator, DRR, or DARD PO for any month included in this\nallocation process, then the ISO shall classify the outage as an FO.\n\n**C. MAINTENANCE** **OUTAGE** **AND** **OVERRUN** **PLANNED** **OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **AND**\n\n**EVALUATION** **PROCESS**\n\nAn MP shall request ISO approval to schedule an MO or OPO if:\n\n(i) the MO or OPO impacts the CSO of the associated Resource,\n\n(ii) the MO or OPO of the DRR is for 5 MW or more and results in the associated\n\nADCR falling short of its CSO by 5 MW or more, or\n\n(iii) the MO or OPO is associated with a Resource without a CSO that is a qualified\n\nReactive Resource.\n\nIf an MO or OPO does not impact the CSO of the associated capacity Resource or if\nthe generator does not have a CSO, the MP shall notify ISO of the MO or OPO.\n\n**1. Processing of MO and OPO Requests**\n\nISO and the respective LCC shall respond to each MO and OPO request as\nfollows:\n\na. Response time shall be based on the following table:\n\n**Response Time Table**\n\n**Submission of MO Request or OPO** **for an**\n**Response time by ISO**\n**Outage Start of:**\n\n5 Business Days in the future (RCAR)* Within 4 Business Days\n\n7 to 14 Calendar Days in the future Within 3 Business Days\n\n4 to 6 Calendar Days in the future Within 1 Business Day\n\n2 to 3 Calendar Days in the future** Within 1 Calendar Day\n\nOvernight or next day, submitted by 0700*** By 0900\n\nOvernight or next day, submitted/requested 0700- Within current day****\n2400\n\n     - Has testing that will result in injection or absorption of a specific reactive power value from the\n\nResource per OP-23\n\n** During any particular week, if an MP requests an outage that cannot be deferred beyond the\n\nweekend, that outage shall be classified as a Forced Outage.\n\n*** An OPO is not applicable in this timeframe\n**** Request shall be evaluated considering Day-Ahead Energy Market and Reserve Adequacy\n\nAnalysis results\n\n|Response Time Table|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Submission of MO Request or OPO for an Outage Start of:|Response time by ISO|\n|5 Business Days in the future (RCAR)*|Within 4 Business Days|\n|7 to 14 Calendar Days in the future|Within 3 Business Days|\n|4 to 6 Calendar Days in the future|Within 1 Business Day|\n|2 to 3 Calendar Days in the future**|Within 1 Calendar Day|\n|Overnight or next day, submitted by 0700***|By 0900|\n|Overnight or next day, submitted/requested 0700- 2400|Within current day****|\n\n\n-----\n\nb. If an MO request results in the forecast of any actions of OP-4 or OP-7, ISO\n\nshall attempt to relocate the MO request to an acceptable period in which\nreliability issues would not be expected to arise. If a request for an OPO\nresults in any actions of OP-4 or OP-7, ISO shall deny the OPO request.\n\nc. With prospective MO or OPO dates identified (that do not affect system\n\nreliability), the ISO shall provide the MO or OPO request information to the\nrespective LCC.\n\nd. The LCC shall notify ISO if the MO or OPO request poses a local\n\ntransmission reliability problem. If it does, ISO shall work with the LCC and\nthe MP to resolve the issue.\n\ne. In an effort to reduce Congestion Costs, ISO shall compare the generator,\n\nDRR, or DARD MO or OPO request against approved transmission outage\nschedules to identify cases where the generator, DRR, or DARD MO or\nOPO schedules could be adjusted to meet this objective. If a potential\nschedule adjustment is identified, ISO shall discuss rescheduling with the\nLCC. The LCC shall coordinate rescheduling with the respective TO and\nthe MP. (Throughout this process, ISO shall work with the respective LCC,\nas needed, to develop alternative outage schedules.)\n\nf. ISO, coordinating with the respective LCC, shall proceed as follows\n\ndepending on whether the case involves:\n\n(1) an importing area,\n\n(2) Generators, DRRs, or DARDs or an exporting area involving a single\nMP, or\n\n(3) an exporting area involving multiple generators, DRRs, or DARDs\ninvolving multiple MPs.\n\ni. Importing area\n\nFor an importing area, the simultaneous outage of transmission\nsupplying the area along with generators, DRRs, or DARDs within the\narea can increase Congestion Costs and, in severe cases, jeopardize\nsystem reliability. To relieve this, the following actions shall be taken\nto try to position the transmission and generators, DRRs, or DARDs\nMOs or OPOs so that they occur at different times.\n```\n      o The LCC shall contact the MP for the generators, DRRs, or\n\n```\nDARDs to determine if there is additional flexibility in the MO or\nOPO position.\n```\n      o The LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in the\n\n```\nTO’s schedule. (Generator, DRR, or DARD outage information\nmay be discussed with the TO, as needed.)\n```\n      o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nand the MP until a determination is made on whether or not\nactivities can be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion\nCosts. [Note: If the above actions are not sufficient to relieve\ncongestion, then ISO shall dispatch generators/DRRs/DARDs\nin accordance with the congestion management process or\nchange the timing of the transmission outage.]\n\nii. Generator, DRR, or DARD or exporting area involving a single MP\n\nThis scenario involves a transmission outage that would restrict the\ncommitment or dispatch of a generator, DRR, or DARD involving a\nsingle MP (i.e., a line leaving a generator, DRR, or DARD station).\nThe following actions shall be taken as soon as possible to try to\nchange or create outage positions so that generator, DRR, or DARD\nand transmission outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the\npotential locked-in generator, DRR, or DARD.\n```\n   o The LCC shall contact the MP for the generator, DRR, or\n\n```\nDARD to determine if there is additional flexibility for the timing\nof the generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO.\n```\n   o LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in the TO’s\n\n```\ntiming of the outage (generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO\noutage information may be discussed with the TO, as needed).\n```\n   o If the transmission outage involves a radial circuit to a\n\n```\ngenerator, DRR, or DARD, this information may be shared with\nthe MP. Additionally, non-radial transmission outage\ninformation may be shared with the MP if the transmission\noutage solely affects that MP.\n```\n   o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO\n\n```\nand the generator, DRR, or DARD MP until a determination is\nmade on whether or not activities can be scheduled to\nreduce/eliminate Congestion Costs.\n```\n   o The TO may contact the MP directly to facilitate positioning of\n\n```\nMOs or OPOs.\n\niii. Exporting area involving multiple generator, DRRs, or DARDs and\n\nmultiple MPs\n\nThis case involves a transmission outage that would restrict the\ncommitment or dispatch of generators, DRRs, or DARDs within an\nexporting area with several generators, DRRs, or DARDs involving\nmultiple MPs. The following actions shall be taken to try to change or\ncreate outage positions so that generators, DRRs, or DARDs and\ntransmission outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the\npotential locked-in generator, DRR, or DARD.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n         o The LCC shall contact the applicable MPs, in the order in\n\n```\nwhich MO or OPO requests were received to determine if there\nis additional flexibility in their generators’, DRRs’, or DARDs’\noutage position.\n```\n         o The LCC shall contact the TO for additional flexibility in its\n\n```\nposition. (Generator, DRR, or DARD MO or OPO information\nmay be discussed with the TO, as needed.)\n```\n         o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO\n\n```\nand MPs until a determination is made on whether or not\noutages may be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion\nCosts.\n```\n         o If generators, DRRs, or DARDs with MO or OPO requests\n\n```\ncannot be repositioned or no MO or OPO requests exist, the\nLCC shall contact affected MPs to inform them that a\ntransmission outage may result in their generator, DRR, or\nDARD being restricted and to determine if they desire to\ncoordinate an MO or OPO of their generator, DRR or DARD\nwith the transmission outage.\n```\n         o If needed, the LCC shall continue to alternately contact the TO\n\n```\nand MPs until a determination is made on whether or not\noutages may be positioned to reduce/eliminate Congestion\nCosts.\n\ng. Upon agreement among ISO, the relevant LCC, the TO, and the MPs for\n\nthe generators, DRRs, or DARDs involved, ISO shall:\n\n(1) perform a final analysis to confirm that the New England RCA/BAA-wide\nand LCC reliability requirements are satisfied and that Congestion Costs\nhave been reduced or eliminated;\n\n(2) notify the MP for the generators, DRRs, or DARDs that the request is\neither approved as submitted, or approved with modifications in accordance\nwith this OP; and\n\n(3) if applicable, update short-term transmission outage information on the\nISO external website.\n\n**2. MO and OPO Requests ISO Reporting**\n\nISO shall notify the submitter of the MO or OPO request of the decision made by\nISO, but shall not have an obligation to notify any other person or entity with an\nownership or contractual interest in the Resource for which the MO or OPO has\nbeen submitted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**D. OUTAGE** **REQUEST** **ON** **NON-CSO** **RESOURCE** **ENROLLED** **IN** **SCHEDULE** **2**\n\n**CAPACITY** **COST** **COMPENSATION** **PROGRAM**\n\nAn MP for a qualified Reactive Resource without a CSO shall submit a PO and MO or\nOPO request. Such requests shall be subject to ISO and LCC review and approval in\naccordance with this OP with the following exceptions:\n\n1. There shall be no OCM evaluation performed.\n\n2. Security analyses shall be limited to voltage studies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV. MARKET PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**1. Information Requirements**\n\na. The changes made during an outage (such as those described in the\n\nfollowing list) may require prior approval from ISO (Planning). If required,\nthe approval from ISO Planning must be obtained before the Resource\nreturns to service. An MP must submit an outage request as soon as\npractical, but no later than the time frames identified in this procedure for\nany reactive control equipment, including, but not limited to:\n\ni. Automatic Voltage Regulators,\n\nii. Synchronous Condensers\n\niii. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (ex. Static Synchronous\n\nCompensator (STATCOM) or Dynamic Volt-Amp Reactive (DVAR)\nor Static VAR Compensator (SVC)),\n\niv. Power Plant Controllers,\n\nv. Distributed Control Systems,\n\nvi. Reactive Control System, and\n\nvii. Power System Stabilizers\n\nb. When submitting a PO, MO or OPO request, an MP shall provide the\n\nfollowing information for each request:\n\ni. “Capacity Resource ID”, only applicable if outage is associated with an\nImport Capacity Resource.\n\nii. For generator/DARD/ATRR: “Asset ID” and “Asset Name”.\n\niii. For DRR: “DRR ID” and DRR Name.\n\niv. MW amount of the physical reduction.\n\nv. Blackstart status during the outage, for blackstart capable Resources\nonly.\n\nvi. Preferred outage start date and time.\n\nvii. Projected outage end date and time.\n\nviii. Outage reason and description of work to be accomplished during the\noutage.\n\nix. Flexibility of the requested outage schedule dates.\n\nx. For an MO, whether the outage can be postponed.\n\nc. An MP shall submit a generator PO, MO or OPO request that crosses\n\ncapability period boundaries as two separate outage requests.\n\n\n-----\n\n    - The summer capability period is comprised of the months June through\n\nSeptember.\n\n    - The winter capability period is comprised of the months of October through\n\nMay.\n\n**2. Information Submittal Process**\n\nEach MP shall submit the required information as follows:\n\na. PO request:\n\n    - Submit a PO request for a generator, electronically through the ISO outage\n\napplication software.\n```\n     o The time-stamp for the PO request shall be the time at which the MP\n\n```\nlast updates the PO request\n\n    - Submit a PO request for a generator, DRR, DARD or ATRR when the\n\noutage application software is not available by electronic (email) to\n[opamoreq@iso-ne.com using the standard form [Appendix B to this OP -](mailto:opamoreq@isone.com)\nOutage Request Form (OP-5B)].\n```\n     o The time-stamp for the PO request will be the time at which the email is\n\n```\nreceived\n\nb. Request for an MO or OPO\n\n    - The MP shall submit an MO or OPO request for a Resource, electronically\n\nthrough the ISO outage application software.\n```\n     o Except that the MP shall not submit an MO into the ISO outage\n\n```\napplication software after 0900 hours the day before the start of the\noutage; a request for an MO made after 0900 hours the day before the\nstart of the MO shall be submitted by contacting the ISO Generation\nCoordinator or ISO Control Room Forecaster.\n```\n     o The time-stamp of the MO or OPO request shall be the time at which the\n\n```\nMP last updates the MO or OPO request.\n\n    - The MP for a DRR, DARD or ATRR shall submit an MO or OPO request to\n\nthe ISO Generation Coordinator by telephone at (413) 535-4378 from 0700\nhours to 1530 hours or the ISO Control Room Forecaster by telephone at\n(413) 535-4340 from 1530 hours to 0700 hours by providing the information\nrequired by this OP. A generator may submit an MO or OPO to the ISO in\nthis manner.\n```\n     o The time-stamp for the MO or OPO request shall be the time at which\n\n```\nthe phone call is received\n\nc. Notification to ISO\n\n\n-----\n\nd.  - If the MP is required to notify the ISO of a reduction to an Import Resource\n\nor generator, as defined in Sections I.G or I.I of this OP, then the MP shall\neither:\n\ne. `o Submit the notification via email using OP-5B`\n\nf. `o Call, by telephone, the ISO Generation Coordinator at (413) 535-4378`\n\nfrom 0700 hours to 1530 hours or the ISO Control Room Forecaster at\n(413) 535-4340 from 1530 hours to 0700 hours to provide the\ninformation required in OP-5B.\n\n**3. Changes To Previously Submitted Outage Requests**\n\nAn MP request to modify a previously submitted PO, MO, or OPO, request shall\nfollow the same process as described in Section III of this OP. ISO shall accept a\nchange request that reduces the scope or duration of the PO, MO, or OPO without\nimpacting the time-stamp of the PO, MO, or OPO request. ISO shall accept a\nchange request that increases the scope or changes the dates of the PO, MO, or\nOPO such that a new outage evaluation is required as a new PO, MO, or OPO\nrequest, which shall be time-stamped accordingly.\n\n**4. Requesting Implementation Of Outage**\n\nImmediately prior to commencing scheduled work, the MP shall obtain ISO Control\nRoom approval for any generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR PO and MO request.\nISO shall not withhold such approval unless the consequences of granting the\napproval would result in a risk of the OP-4 action where a Power Watch is\ndeclared (Action 4) or higher or OP-7 actions, or other serious reliability risk. ISO\nshall inform the respective LCC when the generator, DRR, or DARD is offline and\nout-of-service. For a DRR, a request for implementation of a PO, MO or OPO\nshall be entered in eMarket as the DRR’s bid parameters reflecting the\nimplemented PO, MO or OPO.\n\n**5. Notifying FO**\n\nIf an FO is declared, the MP shall notify the ISO Control Room Generation\nOperator with an appropriate redeclaration for the current Operating Day. The ISO\nGeneration Coordinator shall be contacted at (413) 535-4378 from 0700 to 1530,\nor the ISO Control Room Forecaster by telephone at (413) 535-4340 from 1530 to\n0700, for the purpose of providing an expected FO return date, and to provide any\nnecessary redeclaration for any future days for which the bidding deadline has\npassed. These notifications shall be made as soon as practicable.\n\n**6. Notifying ISO Of Return-To-Service**\n\nAn MP shall notify ISO of the completion of the PO, MO or OPO by releasing the\ngenerator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR to ISO for dispatch. If the MP does not expect\nto return the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR to service on the Operating Day\nindicated on the PO, MO or OPO request, then the MP shall notify ISO of the\n\n\n-----\n\nexpected return date for the generator, DRR, DARD, or ATRR, which may be\ncaptured in a new PO, MO or OPO request. For a DRR, the notification of returnto-service after the PO, MO or OPO shall be entered in eMarket as the DRR’s bid\nparameters reflecting the return–to-service after the PO, MO or OPO.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ATTACHMENTS:**\n\nOP-5 Appendix A - Operable Capacity Calculations\n\nOP-5 Appendix B - Outage Request Form\n\nOP-5 Appendix C - Retired (09/17/12)\n\nOP-5 Appendix D - Retired (06/01/18)\n\n**OP-5 REVISION HISTORY**\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the**\nRTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations\nDate.)\n\n|Rev.

Transmission, Markets and\nService Tariff, Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA), other transmission\noperating agreements and Market Participant Service Agreements provide ISO New\nEngland (ISO) with the operating responsibility and authority necessary to reliably\nand efficiently operate the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing\nAuthority Area (RCA/BAA) in compliance with ISO New England Operating\nDocuments, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Northeast\nPower Coordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) Standards and in accordance with Good\nUtility Practice.\n\nBecause central dispatch responsibilities are divided and/or shared between ISO, the\nLocal Control Centers (LCCs), Transmission Owners (TOs) and Market Participants\n(MPs), it is necessary to establish overall responsibilities and authority. This\nOperating Procedure (OP) defines the overall parameters within which the more\nspecific ISO New England Operating Procedures can be formulated.\n\n**PART II - PRINCIPLES**\n\nThe following principles are adopted. Appendix A expands upon the principles by\nassigning responsibilities to specific operational groups.\n\n1. ISO is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the New England RCA/BAA\n\nin accordance with applicable rules and procedures.\n\n2. An LCC has a responsibility to each TO whose equipment they operate. Also,\n\neach LCC has a responsibility to assist ISO in meeting the objectives of\ncentral dispatch by carrying out instructions, orders and directions received\nfrom ISO.\n\n3.

BACKGROUND**\n\nTransmission outages for construction, tests, maintenance or repair must be\ncoordinated to ensure that reliability is maintained at levels prescribed by ISO New\nEngland (ISO) Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19). In\naddition, whenever possible, transmission and Resource outages will be coordinated\nto reduce congestion costs. For importing areas, economic Resources within the\narea should not be scheduled out coincident with transmission facilities that\nsignificantly support area import capability. For exporting areas, Resource outages\nwithin the area should be coordinated coincident with the outage of transmission\nfacilities that significantly support area export capabilities.\n\nIn addition, this procedure, ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3), is to be construed throughout as reflecting\nthat ISO possesses the ultimate authority for approval of proposed schedules and\nrescheduling of proposed or approved transmission outages based on either\nreliability or market efficiency considerations. The processes described in OP-3 are\nthose that ISO will generally use to consider outage approval, scheduling and\nrescheduling, but shall not diminish or limit ISO’s ultimate authority as described in\nthe preceding sentence.\n\n**B. PURPOSE** **OF** **PROCEDURE**\n\nThe purpose of OP-3 is to:\n\n  - Facilitate the preparation, by each Transmission Owner (TO) and each Local\n\nControl Center (LCC), of TO Long-Term and Short-Term outage plans for their\ntransmission facilities\n\n  - Establish a Long-Term and Short-Term outage request process and a timeline for\n\nsuch outage requests\n\n  - Coordinate transmission outages with Resource outages to plan for reliable\n\noperations and minimize congestion\n\n  - Establish a Long-Term and Short-Term outage scheduling process that does not\n\njeopardize the reliability of the transmission system and continues to minimize\ncongestion\n\n  - Provide guidelines for responding to unplanned outages\n\nOP-3 defines Category A Facilities, Category B Facilities, Major Transmission\nElements (MTE), and Local Area Facilities and also establishes criteria and guides\nfor submitting, evaluating, approving, and denying or repositioning all work on these\nfacilities. A complete list and description of Category A and B Facilities under the\nISO New England Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA) can be found on the\nISO’s OASIS website. Whereas Local Area Facilities involve sub-transmission\nfacilities (below 69kV) that have been delegated to LCCs within New England, a list\nof these facilities is not called for by the TOA between ISO and TOs nor required for\npurposes of OP-3.\n\n\n-----\n\nDefinitions used in this Procedure:\n\nCapitalized terms used but **not otherwise defined in OP-3 have the meanings ascribed**\nthereto in the ISO Tariff, the ISO New England Manuals, the Second Restated New\nEngland Power Pool Agreement and the Participants Agreement.\n\n  - **Category A Facilities:**\n\n**NOTE**\n\n**_The term Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) and its definition has been adopted_**\n**_by NPCC in place of the term Special Protection System (SPS). For existing_**\n**_documentation, the terms Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Special_**\n**_Protection System (SPS) may be used until such time as the terminology is_**\n**_changed by the Transmission Owner on equipment and schematics used in_**\n**_operations and in the field. However, a subset of SPSs were not recognized_**\n**_as RAS and instead became Automatic Control Schemes (ACS)_**\n\nCategory A Facilities include all transmission lines with a voltage level of 115 kV\nand above, except for those 115 kV transmission facilities specifically designated\nas Category B Facilities in accordance with the current TOA Categories of\nTransmission Facilities Section 2.01(e)(ii); all transmission interties between\nControl Areas; all transformers that have Category A Facilities connected to the\nlower voltage side of the transformer; all transformers that require a Category A\nFacility to be taken out-of-service when the transformer is taken out-of-service;\nand all breakers and disconnects connected to, and all shunts, relays, reclosing\nand associated equipment, dynamic reactive resources, Flexible Alternating\nCurrent Transmission System (FACTS) controllers, Remedial Action Schemes\n(RAS) or Automatic Control Schemes (ACS), Phase Shifting Transformers (PSTs),\nand other equipment specifically installed to support the operation of such\ntransmission lines, interties, and transformers.\n\n  - **Category B Facilities:**\n\nCategory B Facilities include all 115 kV radial transmission lines and all 69 kV\ntransmission lines that are not interties between Control Areas; all transformers\nthat have any Category B Facilities and no Category A Facilities connected to the\nlower voltage side of the transformer except to the extent such transformers are\ndesignated as Category A Facilities in accordance with the current TOA\nCategories of Transmission Facilities Section 2.01(e)(i); and all breakers and\ndisconnects connected to, and all shunts, relays, reclosing and associated\nequipment, dynamic reactive resources, FACTS controllers, RASs or ACSs,\nPSTs, and other equipment specifically installed to support the operation of such\nCategory B Facilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n- **Local Area Facilities:**\n\nThe transmission facilities of a Participating Transmission Owner (PTO) within the\nNew England Transmission System with a voltage level of less than 69 kV and all\ntransformers that have no Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities connected\nto the lower voltage side of the transformer that are not listed in TOA Categories\nof Transmission Facilities Schedule 2.01(a), Schedule 2.01(b) and are not\nexcluded facilities. Section 2.01(e)(iii) of the TOA defines Local Area Facilities as\nincluding “all transmission facilities with a voltage level of less than 69 kV and all\ntransformers that have no Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities connected\nto the lower voltage side of the transformer.\n\n- **Congestion Costs:**\n\nThe estimated increased expenses resulting from forecasted real-time\ncommitment or re-dispatch of “out of merit” Resources and/or the forecasted realtime re-dispatch or de-commitment of “in merit” Resources in the Energy &\nReserves Markets to respect operating criteria.\n\n- **Long-Term Transmission Outage:**\n\nA Planned Transmission Outage submitted for ISO Interim-Approval up to two (2)\n\nyears and greater than or equal to twenty-one (21) days prior to the day the\noutage is scheduled to begin.\n\n- **Major Transmission Elements (MTE):**\n\nMTE are a subset of Category A Facilities and Category B Facilities that affect\n\nResources and may be further identified as, but not limited to, facilities defined or\nreferenced in:\n```\n   o Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) Facilities for Notification\n   o Defined external interfaces\n   o Defined internal interfaces\n   o Restrictions on the operation of a Resource\n   o A Transmission Operating Guide (TOG)\n\n```\nAs a result of the above criteria, MTE (acting individually) may have a significant\nimpact on the reliable and/or economic operation of the New England\nTransmission System and as a result, may have greater exposure to being\ncancelled or denied because of economic impacts than other transmission\nfacilities.\n\nA list of MTE equipment is provided in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No.\n7 - Processing Outage Applications (M/LCC 7) Attachment E- Major Transmission\nElement Listing.\n\n\n-----\n\n- **Resource**\n\nIs identified as a Generator Asset, a Dispatchable Asset Related Demand\n(DARD), an External Resource, and a Demand Response Resource.\n\n- **Opportunity Outage**\n\nThis is an outage that does not satisfy the minimum advance notice time required\nfor Planned Short-Term Transmission Outage processing and is submitted for ISO\nApproval as a result of an unexpected opportunity to accomplish work that would\notherwise require another outage at a less opportune time. An Opportunity\nOutage shall be coordinated to minimize the overall impact on system reliability\nand market efficiency. An Opportunity Outage is categorized as neither Planned\n**nor Unplanned and is most often initiated by, but not limited to, any of the**\nfollowing:\n```\n   o An Unplanned Resource Outage; \n   o Expedited completion of a Transmission or Resource outage (or project); \n   o Forecasted operating conditions are favorable for the work to be performed\n\n```\nAn Opportunity Outage request shall be submitted to ISO no more than one\nhundred and twenty (120) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to begin\nand no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to\nbegin. When the proper studies are completed and if the Opportunity Outage is\nApproved, that Opportunity Outage is included in the Day-Ahead Energy Market\n(DAM) transmission topology assumptions. An Opportunity Outage, whether\nApproved or Implemented, shall not be permitted if that Opportunity Outage\nimposes additional restrictions on MW Resources (Resources and/or inter-ties)\nthat would not otherwise exist in the absence of the Opportunity Outage.\n\nAn Opportunity Outage request submitted to ISO must adhere to the following\nadditional conditions:\n```\n   o Restoration (recall) time, does not exceed eight (8) hours\n   o Limited duration, does not exceed one hundred and eight (108) hour period\n   o If an underway transmission outage unexpectedly exceeds either of the\n\n```\nabove timing criterion, the entire Opportunity Outage shall be converted to a\nForced Outage\n```\n   o An Opportunity Outage shall receive the lowest priority when competing\n\n```\nwith all other outage types that are Planned or Unplanned\n\n- **Planned Outage:**\n\nA transmission outage request that satisfies the minimum advance notice times\nassociated with either the Long-Term or Short-Term Transmission Outage\nprocessing.\n\n- **Recall Time:**\n\nThe measured time from when ISO/LCC requests an LCC/TO to safely restore a\ntransmission element from outage state to in-service.\n\n\n-----\n\n- **Short-Term Transmission Outage:**\n\nA Planned Transmission Outage submitted for ISO Approval less than twenty-one\n(21) days and greater than one hundred and twenty (120) hours prior to 0001 of\nthe day the outage is scheduled to begin.\n\n- **Significantly Reduced Congestion Costs:**\n\nReductions in forecasted real-time congestion and Net Commitment-Period\nCompensation (NCPC) costs resulting from the repositioning of a transmission\noutage are considered significant when the reduction minus the PTO’s incremental\ndirect costs for repositioning the outage exceeds $200,000 per week or any\nportion of a week.\n\n- **Transmission Outage Request Flags:**\n\nOne or more of the following additional identifiers may be associated with each\noutage to set outage priority as described in this definition section:\n\n`o` **Long-Term Economic Approval**\n\n`o` **Outage Overrun**\n\n- **Transmission Outage Request Status:**\n\nOne of the following:\n\n`o` **Active Status**\n\n   - **Preliminary: Planned Transmission Outage provided to ISO for**\n\ninformational purposes only; no studies shall be conducted by ISO until the\noutage has been moved to the status of Submitted by the LCC\n\n   - **Submitted: Transmission outages prepared for ISO study and acceptance**\n\nand awaiting Interim Approved Status or Approved Status\n\n   - **Study: Transmission outages actively being studied and evaluated by ISO**\n\nto determine Interim Approved Status or Approved Status\n\n   - **Negotiate: Transmission outages under additional review and/or pending**\n\nrepositioning\n\n   - **Interim Approved: Transmission outages that have been studied and**\n\naccepted by ISO through the Long-Term Transmission Outage process but\nwaiting final Approved status through the Short-Term Transmission Outage\nProcess\n\n   - **Approved: Transmission outages studied and accepted by ISO in**\n\naccordance with the Short-Term Transmission Outage process\n\n   - **Implemented: Transmission outage that has begun, reflecting equipment**\n\ntaken out-of-service or in an abnormal state\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` **Non-Active Status**\n\n   - **Withdrawn: Preliminary Transmission outages that are no longer planned**\n\nby the TO or have lapsed within twenty-one (21) days prior to the start date\n\n   - **Denied: Transmission outage requests which have not been Approved or**\n\nInterim Approved\n\n   - **Cancelled: Previously Approved Transmission outages (Interim Approved**\n\nor Approved) that have been called off by the TO, LCC or ISO\n\n   - **Completed: A Transmission outage that had been returned to service**\n\n- **Unplanned Outage:**\n\nThis is any outage that cannot be planned and fails to satisfy the lead times\nrequired for Planned Short-Term Transmission Outage processing. The following\nare the three types of Unplanned Outages:\n\n**1. Emergency Outage**\n\nThe obvious failure of a piece of transmission equipment that comes out-ofservice on its own or requires immediate operator intervention to remove it\nfrom service.\n\n**2. Forced Outage**\n\nThe discovery of a problem that needs to be repaired as soon as crews,\nequipment, and/or corrective dispatch actions may be put in place to allow the\nwork to be performed. By definition, a Forced Outage cannot be scheduled.\nMore specifically:\n\n   - A Forced Outage cannot be delayed to avoid paying overtime rates; e.g.,\n\non a Friday, delaying a Forced Outage until Monday, rather than performing\nthe work on Saturday. This implies that a Forced Outage must occur on\nconsecutive days, except in the case described in the next bullet.\n\n   - A Forced Outage cannot schedule an Alternate Date. If weather impairs\n\nsafe work conditions, the outage may be moved to the next available fair\nweather day, and the planned end date/time shall be extended.\n\n   - An Opportunity Outage that unexpectedly causes additional adverse impact\n\non either system reliability or market efficiency beyond that which was\noriginally anticipated. Typically this would be associated with the\nunexpected extension of the defined timing parameters.\n\n**3. Overrun Outage**\n\nThis is any outage that fails to return to service by its planned end date, and\nthe outage has extended into the next calendar day.\n\n\n-----\n\n**III. AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\n**A. ISO** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nISO shall:\n\n    - Receive from LCCs, Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests\n\nthat were approved by the LCCs, for all Category A Facilities, and for Category B\nFacilities if Resource output could be affected by the outage. Outage requests\nfor Local Area Facilities that affect Resource output shall be processed using\nLCC and ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource Maintenance\nand Outage Scheduling (OP-5) scheduling practices.\n\n    - Review proposed outages in the Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission\n\nOutage requests and compare them to Resource outage plans as follows:\n```\n     o Evaluate the impact of proposed transmission outages on the reliability of the\n\n```\nNew England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area\n(RCA/BAA) power system operations. Reposition or deny any outage that\ncould be expected to violate reliability criteria for the New England\nTransmission System and for which repositioning the outage could reasonably\nbe expected to improve reliability.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nISO will coordinate efforts with the LCCs to evaluate the risk of implemented\nor proposed transmission outages that may pose a risk to system reliability\nbased on forecasted loads or current or expected system conditions. ISO\nand the LCCs should attempt to mitigate this risk by repositioning or\nrecalling transmission outages that could impact transfer capability on\ninterfaces internal and external to ISO, restrict or isolate a Resource, or\nimpact energy security.\n```\n     o Work with LCCs to adjust Resource and transmission outages to minimize\n\n```\ncongestion costs. When warranted, and time permitting, perform economic\nanalyses of outage alternatives to define and examine potential congestion\ncosts. Reposition the outage if Significantly Reduced Congestion Costs are\nfeasible, or where lesser congestion reduction is available and the TO(s)\nagree.\n```\n     o Have the authority to reposition or deny any outage that adversely impacts\n\n```\nmarket efficiency.\n```\n     o Support outage scheduling related communications between TOs and\n\n```\nResource owners to assure affected parties are appropriately notified in a\ntimely manner.\n\n    - Appropriately notify LCCs and Market Participants (MPs) of action regarding\n\noutage requests.\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Assign to the LCCs the function of receiving, evaluating, approving or denying\n\ntransmission outage requests submitted by a TO, with respect to its impact on the\nreliability and congestion of LCC operations.\n\n   - Promote the continuous flow of information between ISO, LCCs, and TOs to\n\nmatch pending transmission outage work with planned or forced Resource\noutages to the extent practicable.\n\n   - Monitor the outage positioning activities of the TOs. ISO shall have the right to\n\nrequest that a TO provide information to ISO Market Monitoring concerning any\nTO positioning of transmission facility outages, including the repositioning or\ncancellation of any Planned, Scheduled or Approved Outage.\n\n   - Assign each Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage request a number,\n\ndate stamp and Status. In general, the number, date stamp and Status will be\nused, if needed, to prioritize outage requests. ISO will attempt to resolve\nconflicting Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests through\ndiscussions with the affected LCCs. When discussions cannot resolve the\nconflict, the Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage that was Submitted\nearliest shall have priority.\n\n   - Post and maintain a list of requested outages with corresponding Status on the\n\nISO external website within the limitations of the ISO New England Information\nPolicy.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn accordance with the ISO New England Information Policy and to avoid the potential\nexercising of market power by any entity, outages that will isolate a Resource (such as\nradial circuits to Resources) will not be posted.\n\n**B. LCC** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nLCCs shall:\n\n   - Receive TO Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests from TOs\n\nfor all Category A Facilities, and for Category B Facilities if Resource output could\nbe affected by the outage. Outage requests for Local Area Facilities that affect\nResource output shall be processed using LCC and ISO\nOP-5 scheduling practices\n\n   - Prior to submitting proposed outages to ISO for final evaluation and approval,\n\nreview proposed Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests and\ncompare them with Resource outage plans and requests received from ISO as\nfollows:\n```\n    o Evaluate the impacts of proposed transmission outages on the reliability of\n\n```\nLCC operations. Reposition or disapprove any outage that could be expected\nto violate LCC reliability criteria and for which repositioning the outage could\nreasonably be expected to improve reliability\n\n\n-----\n\n**NOTE**\n\nISO will coordinate efforts with the LCCs to evaluate the risk of implemented\nor proposed transmission outages that may pose a risk to system reliability\nbased on forecasted loads or current or expected system conditions. ISO\nand the LCCs should attempt to mitigate this risk by repositioning or\nrecalling transmission outages that could impact transfer capability on\ninterfaces internal and external to ISO, restrict or isolate a Resource, or\nimpact energy security.\n```\n   o Identify and pursue cases where Resource and transmission outages could\n\n```\nbe adjusted to reduce/eliminate Congestion Costs and overall outage\nduration. In each case, LCCs will facilitate/coordinate outages as detailed in\nSection VI.B.1 of this procedure to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion\nCosts, or to achieve lesser congestion reduction if the TO(s) agree.\n\n  - After LCC review, Submit Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outages to\n\nISO for further evaluation and coordination\n\n  - Transmit ISO actions regarding outage requests to TOs\n\n  - Perform dispatching functions for all Category B and Local Area Facilities if\n\nResource output is not affected by the outage, if assigned that responsibility by\nits MPs\n\n  - Promote a continuous flow of information between ISO and TOs to match\n\npending transmission outage work with Resource outages to the extent\npracticable\n\n  - Notify Market Participants (MPs) of potential limitations caused by transmission\n\noutages\n\n**NOTE**\n\nNon-public transmission outage information and outage information associated\n\nwith other Resources shall not be shared with the Resource Owners contacted.\n\n  - Refrain from engaging in multi-party communications simultaneously with\n\nResource and TOs unless the transmission outage of concern only affects one\nResource owner\n\n**C. TO** **AUTHORITIES** **AND** **RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nTOs or their designees shall:\n\n  - Submit their proposed or updated transmission outage plans to their respective\n\nLCC and provide as much information as possible on the flexibility of shifting the\nrequested period forward or backwards\n\n  - Work with LCCs and ISO to provide alternate outage dates when it is determined\n\nthat congestion could be eliminated or reduced by doing so\n\n  - Propose changes to any requested outage promptly after circumstances develop\n\nand submit reasons for the change to the LCC\n\n\n-----\n\n  - When requested, submit information concerning the TO positioning of\n\ntransmission facility outages to ISO\n\n  - Participating TOs will provide information regarding their direct costs for canceling\n\noutages to their LCC and ISO when requested.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe PTO staff working on transmission outages may be provided with Resource outage\ninformation to assist in the establishment of outage plans and determining alternate\ndates. The PTO staff working on transmission outages shall not disclose this\ninformation to other parties.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IV. ROUTING TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**\n\nThe TO or MP requesting work on transmission facilities covered by OP-3 shall initially\nsubmit a transmission outage request to the appropriate LCC. This section describes\nthe subsequent routing of transmission outage requests.\n\n1. Facilities solely under the Jurisdiction of the LCC:\n\nCategory B Facilities not affecting Resource output and all Local Area\nTransmission Facilities are under the jurisdiction of the LCC. The handling of\noutages for these facilities is an LCC function. Transmission outage requests are\nacted upon by the LCCs and need not be forwarded to ISO; however outages\ninvolving Local Area Facilities affecting a Resource shall be processed using LCC\nand ISO OP-5 scheduling practices. Outages involving Category B Facilities not\naffecting a Resource shall be sent to ISO in a daily summary sheet.\n\n2. Facilities requiring assessment by the LCC and ISO:\n\nUnless the LCC denies the transmission outage request, the LCC shall review,\nstudy and record assumptions and results for Category A and Category B\nFacilities prior to forwarding to ISO for assessment.\n\n3. Inter-LCC and Inter-Area Facilities:\n\nBecause of the special communication requirements that apply when\ntransmission outage requests involve Inter-LCC (i.e., facilities crossing LCC\nboundaries but not leaving the New England RCA/BAA) and Inter-RCA/BAA\nfacilities, the LCC and ISO shall coordinate these transmission outage requests\nas follows:\n\n`o` **Inter-LCC facilities: The LCC shall forward transmission outage requests to**\n\nthe adjacent LCC and to ISO for approval or denial\n\n`o` **Inter-RCA/BAA facilities - New York Independent System Operator**\n\n**(NYISO) and New Brunswick Power System Operator (NBPSO): The LCC**\nshall forward transmission outage requests to the appropriate adjacent system\ndispatch agency and to ISO. ISO shall forward transmission outage requests\nto the appropriate NPCC Reliability Coordinator/Balancing Authority (RC/BA)\nfor approval or denial\n\n`o` **Inter-RCA/BAA facilities - TransEnergie: The LCC shall forward**\n\ntransmission outage requests to ISO. ISO shall perform all coordination with\nTransEnergie. Transmission outage requests shall be forwarded to\nTransEnergie for approval or denial\n\n4. Transmission outage requests initiated outside the New England RCA/BAA\n\nTransmission outage requests initiated by systems outside the New England\nRCA/BAA for work on inter-RCA/BAA facilities will first be communicated from the\noutside company to the involved LCC. If the LCC and outside company agree to\ntimes and dates for an outage, the outside company will forward the transmission\noutage request to its NPCC RC/BA who will assess the transmission outage\nrequest and if approved, forward it to ISO for approval under Section V or VI.\nISO will notify the appropriate LCC\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Facilities on the NPCC Area Facilities for Notification List\n\nIn addition to inter-RCA/BAA facilities, there are other facilities in each NPCC\nRCA/BAA that, if taken out-of-service, can affect adjacent RCAs/BAAs. These\nfacilities are listed in the document entitled, NPCC Directory #1 Design and\nOperation of the Bulk Power System, Appendix F: Procedure for Operational\nPlanning Coordination, NPCC Facilities Notification List - Attachment D. ISO\nshall forward transmission outage requests received from the LCCs, involving the\nNew England RCA/BAA facilities listed in NPCC Directory #1, Appendix F,\nAttachment D, to the appropriate NPCC RCs/BAs for approval or disapproval.\nTransmission outage requests received by ISO from adjacent NPCC RCAs/BAAs,\ninvolving NPCC RCA/BAA facilities which can affect the New England RCA/BAA\ntransmission system, shall be reviewed by ISO for approval under Section V or VI\nand reported to the appropriate LCCs.\n\n**V. LONG-TERM TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**\n\n**A. SCOPE** **OF** **LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REQUESTS**\n\nLong-Term Transmission Outage requests shall include Category A Facilities and\nCategory B Facilities that affect Resource(s). The outage of any associated\nequipment including but not limited to: breakers, disconnects, shunts, static VAr\ncompensators(SVCs), STATCOMs, series reactors or capacitors and phase shifting\ntransformers (PSTs) shall be reported.\n\nRelays, reclosing and RAS or ACS outages shall be reported in accordance with ISO\nNew England Operating Procedure No.24 - Protection Outages, Settings and\nCoordination (OP-24).\n\nUnless cancelled, Interim Approved Long-Term Transmission Outages shall\nautomatically progress into the Short-Term Outage process, as described in Section\nVI of this Procedure.\n\n**B. MINIMUM** **ADVANCED** **NOTICE** **TIME-RESPONSE** **TIME** **FOR** **LONG-TERM**\n\n**TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES**\n\nIn accordance with LCC procedures, TOs or their designees shall submit their\nproposed or updated Long-Term Transmission Outages for all Category A Facilities\nand Category B Facilities if a Resource output could be affected by the outage. The\nLCCs or their designees shall submit the Long-Term Transmission Outage request in\nthe Preliminary status to ISO. ISO will not take any action to study or coordinate\noutages with Preliminary status. Preliminary status shall be considered informational\nonly and will not set scheduling priority based on timestamp. Preliminary status shall\n**not be accepted within twenty-one (21) days of the start date of the outage and any**\noutages that were previously submitted and remain in Preliminary status shall be\nautomatically withdrawn at twenty-one (21) days prior to the start date. It is expected\nthat once the TO confirms these outage plans with the LCC, that the Long-Term\nTransmission Outage request will be put into the Submitted status.\n\nThe LCCs shall provide Long-Term Transmission Outage requests in Submitted\nstatus that have been studied, approved and provide appropriate documentation as\ndescribed in this procedure. This indicates to ISO that the Long-Term Transmission\n\n\n-----\n\nscheduling priority. Submitted Long-Term Transmission Outage requests shall be\naccepted no sooner than twenty-four (24) months and no later than twenty-one (21)\ndays prior to the start date of the transmission outage.\n\nISO shall study Long-Term Transmission Outage requests in the Submitted status.\nPrior to the ISO study, efforts to review and coordinate outages to reduce reliability\nand economic impact shall be underway. Once the ISO study begins or until the\nrequest is terminated, details of the Long-Term Transmission Outage request will be\nlocked from any changes initiated by the LCC. ISO may require cancellation and/or\na new submittal if significant changes are requested by the LCC. If further\ninformation supporting the outage is required, ISO will place the outage in Negotiate.\nUpon study completion, ISO shall apply a status of: Interim Approved or Denied and\nrespond to the appropriate LCC.\n\nLong-Term Transmission Outage requests Submitted to ISO at least ninety (90) days\nprior to the start of the outage, if approved through reliability studies, may also be\nsubjected to economic studies and possible repositioning. Facilities identified as\nMTE may be subjected to economic studies and possible repositioning. The process\nof Submitting Long-Term Transmission Outage requests involving an MTE facility at\nleast ninety (90) days prior to the start date of the outage does not ensure that it will\nbe Approved nor does it set any scheduling priority over any other previously\nSubmitted Long-Term Transmission Outage request. However, once such a request\nis approved for economics, the applicant will have greater assurance that it will not\nbe cancelled at a later date due to economic impacts.\n\nA Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to ISO at least twentyone (21) days prior to the start date of the outage and is approved for reliability will\nreceive Interim Approved Status.\n\nA Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to the ISO at least\nninety (90) days prior to the start date of the outage, approved for reliability and\nselected for economic study and ultimately approved, shall receive the flag LongTerm Economic Approval.\n\nA Long-Term Transmission Outage request that is Submitted to ISO less than ninety\n(90) days prior to the start date of the outage and is given the status of Interim\nApproved through the Long-Term Transmission Outage process may be subjected to\neconomic studies and possible repositioning in the Short-Term Transmission Outage\nprocess. These Long-Term Transmission Outages will be at risk for cancellation for\neconomic impact up to the time the outage actually begins.\n\n**C. LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REVIEW** **MORATORIUM**\n\n1. Annual Forward Capacity Market (FCM) Reliability Review\n\na. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM annual\n\nbilateral submittals for the upcoming FCM Capacity Commitment Period\n(CCP); Long-Term Transmission Outage requests for outages that fall within\nJune 1[st] through September 15[th] of the FCM CCP will be time stamped to\nestablish review priority and held until the FCM bilateral reliability review\nprocess is completed.\n\n\n-----\n\n(1) Annual Bilateral reliability review period begins immediately following the\n\nclose of the Annual Bilateral submittal period for the applicable FCM CCP.\n\nb. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of the FCM 3[rd]\n\nannual reconfiguration auction results for the applicable FCM CCP, Long-term\nTransmission Outage requests for outages that fall within June 1[st] through\nSeptember 15[th] of the FCM CCP will be time-stamped to establish review\npriority and held until the auction results reliability review is completed.\n\n2. Monthly FCM Reliability Review\n\na. During the period when ISO is performing reliability reviews of FCM monthly\n\nbilateral submittals and monthly reconfiguration auction results for the\napplicable month, Long-Term Transmission Outage requests for outages that\nfall within the applicable month will be time-stamped to establish review\npriority and held until the reliability review process is completed.\n\n**D. REPOSITIONING** **LONG-TERM** **OUTAGE** **REQUESTS**\n\nISO and LCCs, working with TOs, and Resources, shall reposition outages:\n\n1) That could be expected to violate reliability criteria; or\n\n2) To reduce or eliminate Congestion Costs.\n\nISO and LCCs, during their review, can reposition the facility outage of a TO if it\ncould be expected to violate reliability criteria. During their review, ISO and LCCs\ncan also reposition the facility outage of a PTO if it could be expected to achieve\nSignificantly Reduced Congestion Costs. Furthermore, an outage may be\nrepositioned to avoid net costs less than the $200K threshold if agreed to by the\ninvolved TO(s).\n\nISO and the LCC, working with the PTO, will generally reschedule, within ninety (90)\ndays of the original schedule, any Long-Term Transmission Outage that requires\nrepositioning for reliability violations or to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion\nCosts. In the event that the ninety (90)-day period falls between June 1[st] and\nSeptember 15[th], ISO and the LCCs will generally reschedule such a Long-Term\nTransmission Outage during a period that begins no later than October 31[st].\n\nTOs can propose changes to Long-Term Transmission Outage requests. The TO\nmust notify the applicable LCC promptly after circumstances develop that\nnecessitate such a change. The notification must include a description of the\ncircumstances that led to the change request. The LCC will promptly forward the\ninformation to ISO. Changes to a Long-Term Transmission Outage request may\nresult in a requirement to submit a new request, sacrificing any scheduling priority\nand shall be subject to ISO Market Monitoring review.\n\n\n-----\n\n**E. REPORTS** **-** **LONG-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES** **PROJECTED** **OUT** **24**\n\n**MONTHS**\n\nISO shall create and maintain a New England Long-Term Transmission Outage\nReport and post the report daily on the ISO external website in accordance with the\nISO New England Information Policy. This report shall incorporate outages in the\nfollowing states: Preliminary, Submitted, Study, Negotiate and Interim Approved for\nthe time frame beginning twenty-four (24) months in advance of the current day and\nending within twenty-one (21) days of the current day.\n\n**VI. SHORT-TERM TRANSMISSION OUTAGE REQUESTS**\n\n**A. MINIMUM** **ADVANCE** **NOTICE** **TIME** **-** **RESPONSE** **TIME** **FOR** **SHORT-TERM**\n\n**TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGES**\n\nOutages of transmission facilities may require extensive study and coordination, first\nby the LCC to assess local area reliability and perform rudimentary congestion\nanalysis and then by ISO to assess bulk power system reliability and perform\nwarranted detailed congestion analysis. Operating policies at the LCCs define\nminimum advance notice times for the submittal of Short-Term Transmission Outage\nrequests from the TOs to the LCCs. These notice times are critical and designed to\nprovide the LCCs with enough time to assess TO Short-Term Transmission Outage\nrequests before denying them or forwarding them to ISO for further analysis and\nultimate approval.\n\nSimilarly, ISO needs enough time to assess the Short-Term Transmission Outage\nrequests and deny or approve them. Furthermore, Approved outages must be\nknown in time for use in the settlement of the DAM, and TOs must know in time to\ncoordinate final steps to arrange equipment and manpower needed to do the work.\nTo provide adequate time for this analysis and coordination, application advance\nnotice times, and ISO response times, have been established.\n\nTransmission Facilities\n\n1. In general, all Category A Facility outages and Category B Facility outages that\n\naffect a Resource shall require the submittal of a Short-Term Transmission\nOutage application. LCCs and neighboring RCs/BAs shall submit Short-Term\nTransmission Outage requests for these facilities to ISO at least one hundred and\ntwenty (120) hours prior to 0001 on the day when work is to begin (Example: An\noutage positioned to begin at 0800 on Monday must be submitted to ISO before\n0001 on Wednesday the week prior.) ISO shall approve/deny requests at least\ntwenty-four (24) hours prior to 0001 on the day the work is to begin. ISO shall\nalso have the authority to waive either of these timeframes.\n\n2. To facilitate the submittal of Short-Term Transmission Outage requests for\n\nspecific transmission facilities, a detailed guide is provided in M/LCC 7. The\nformat of the guide goes by voltage level and the type of transmission facility,\nwhich is a natural logic structure for considering transmission facilities. Minimum\nadvance notice times are given for each type of facility. These times reflect the\npractical application of facility categories defined in this document.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. LCCs do not have to submit requests to ISO for outages involving Local Area\n\nFacilities. However, outage requests for Local Area Facilities that affect a\nResource output shall be processed using LCC and OP-5 scheduling practices.\n\nIn general, complex outages, particularly those involving more than one LCC\nand/or dispatch entities outside the New England RCA/BAA, will require\nsignificantly longer coordination efforts. Consequently, discussions of these\noutages by involved parties must begin several months early to coordinate the\nsystem for the expected work. General information on these outages will first be\nsubmitted by the TOs via the Long-Term Transmission Outage process. Details\non these outages shall be submitted to LCCs and in turn to ISO as soon as TOs\nhave finalized arrangements.\n\n**B. SHORT-TERM** **TRANSMISSION** **OUTAGE** **REVIEW** **AND** **APPROVAL** **PROCESS**\n\nLCC Review and Action:\n\n1. Upon receipt of requests for work on Category A Facilities or Category B Facilities\n\nthat affect Resource output, the LCC shall perform the following:\n\na. Prior to submittal for ISO Short-Term Outage Request approval, the LCC shall\n\nreview all Scheduled Outages and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests\nand compare them with Resource outage requests received from ISO.\nEvaluate Short-Term Transmission Outage requests to assure reliable\noperation. Deny any Short-Term Transmission Outage request that violates\nany LCC operating procedure or is determined to be in violation of any ISO\nOP or TOG.\n\nb. Prior to submittal to ISO for Short-Term Outage Request approval, the LCC\n\nshall, working with ISO, identify cases where Resource and transmission\noutage positions could potentially be adjusted to achieve Significantly\nReduced Congestion Costs, or (with TO consent) where lesser congestion\nreduction may be achieved. In each case, facilitate/coordinate repositioning\nas follows:\n\n(1) Discuss and assess the preliminary plan for outage repositioning with ISO\n\n(2) Contact the TO for additional flexibility in their timing of the outage.\n\n(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as\nrequired)\n\n(3) After consulting with the TO, if needed, proceed as follows depending on\n\nwhether the case involves;\n\ni) an importing local area,\n\nii) a Resource or exporting local area involving a single owner\n\niii) an exporting local area involving multiple Resources owned by\n\nmultiple entities\n\n\n-----\n\n(a) Importing Local Area\n\nFor an importing local area, the simultaneous outage of transmission\nsupplying the local area along with Resource(s) within the local area\ncan increase congestion and, in severe cases, jeopardize system\nreliability. To relieve this, the following actions will be taken to try to\nposition the transmission, and Resource outages so that they occur at\ndifferent times:\n\n          - Contact the applicable Resource Owners to determine if the\n\noutage may be repositioned\n\n          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.\n\n(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as\nrequired.)\n\n          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and the\n\nResource Owner until a determination is made by ISO on whether\nor not activities may be repositioned to reduce/eliminate\ncongestion\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf actions above are not sufficient to relieve congestion, ISO will dispatch Resources in\naccordance with the congestion management process or change the timing of the\ntransmission outage.\n\n(b) Resource or Exporting Local Area Involving a Single Owner\n\nThis scenario involves a Short-Term Transmission Outage that will\nrestrict the commitment or dispatch of Resources owned by a single\nentity (i.e., a line leaving a generating station). The following actions\nwill be taken as soon as possible to try to change or create outage\npositions so that Resources and transmission outages occur\nsimultaneously, thereby relieving the potential locked-in Resources.\n\n          - Contact the applicable Resource owner to determine if the outage\n\nmay be repositioned. If the Short-Term Transmission Outage\ninvolves a radial circuit to a Resource, details about the\ntransmission outage can be shared with the Resource Owner.\nAdditionally, non-radial transmission outage information can be\nshared with the Resource Owner if the Short-Term Transmission\nOutage solely affects that Resource Owner\n\n          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.\n\n(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as\nrequired.)\n\n          - If required, continue to alternately contact the PTO and Resource\n\nowner until a determination is made by ISO on whether or not\nactivities may be repositioned to reduce/eliminate congestion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PTO may contact the Resource Owner directly to facilitate\n\npositioning of outages\n\n(c) Exporting Local Area Involving multiple Resources owned by multiple\n\nentities\n\nThis case involves a Short-Term Transmission Outage that will\nrestrict the commitment or dispatch of Resources within an exporting\nlocal area that contains several units owned by different Resource\nowners. The following actions will be taken to try to change or create\noutage positions so that Resources outages and Short-Term\nTransmission Outages occur simultaneously, thereby relieving the\npotential locked-in Resource.\n\n          - Contact the applicable Resource owners to determine if the\n\noutage may be repositioned in the order that their outage request\nwas received\n\n          - Contact the TO to determine if the outage may be repositioned.\n\n(Resource outage information may be discussed with the PTO as\nrequired.)\n\n          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and Resource\n\nowners until a determination is made by ISO on whether or not\nactivities can be positioned to reduce/eliminate congestion\n\n          - If units with outage requests are exhausted or no outage requests\n\nexist, contact affected Resource owners randomly, in a manner to\nbe determined by the LCC, without preference to any one\nResource owner. Inform each Resource owner that a Short-Term\nTransmission Outage (no details) may result in their unit being\nrestricted and determine if they desire to coordinate an outage of\ntheir unit with the Short-Term Transmission Outage\n\n          - If required, continue to alternately contact the TO and Resource\n\nowners until a determination is made on whether or not activities\nmay be repositioned to reduce/eliminate congestion costs\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf actions above do not alleviate constraints, ISO will dispatch Resources in the\nconstrained export area based on its congestion management process or change the\nposition of the transmission outage.\n\nc. Once the Short-Term Transmission Outage has initial approval, either with or\n\nwithout a corresponding Resource outage:\n\n(1) notify adjacent LCCs and/or systems outside of the New England\n\nRCA/BAA that may be affected by the requested work, and\n\n(2) forward the application to ISO with the following information:\n\ni) Facility (name and nomenclature).\n\n\n-----\n\nii) Reason for application (work to be done).\n\niii) Emergency restoration time in hours.\n\niv) Time and date switching is to begin.\n\nv) Time and date the facility is to be restored to normal operation.\n\nvi) LCCs and/or systems outside of the New England RCA/BAA to\n\nwhom notifications have been given.\n\nvii) Other information pertinent to the application that may affect ISO\n\ndecision, such as a request to revise a Resource outage schedule\nto address congestion issues with the transmission outage.\n\nviii) LCC analysis results and approval including contingencies and\n\nlimiting elements, local voltage constraints, must run Resources\nand restricted Resources.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nRequests submitted by adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs must also be accompanied by\ninformation listed in items i) through vii) above.\n\n2. ISO Review and Reliability Study for Short-Term Transmission Outages:\n\nUpon receipt of a request from an LCC for a Short-Term Transmission Outage,\nISO shall:\n\na. Assign the application an identification number.\n\nb. Forward requests involving inter-RCA/BAA or NPCC Directory #1, Appendix F,\n\nAttachment D facilities to the appropriate NPCC RC/BA for approval or denial.\n\nc. Inform, as required, other LCCs or NPCC RCs/BAs.\n\nd. Conduct reliability studies in sufficient detail to:\n\n(1) Identify the more severe probable first contingencies (there may be\n\nseveral).\n\n(2) Identify voltage constraints and thermally limiting contingencies and\n\nelements, expected flows on limiting elements, ratings [Normal, LongTerm Emergency (LTE), Short-Term Emergency (STE), Drastic Action\nLimit (DAL)] of limiting elements and provide distribution and adjustment\nfactors. Determine if any pre-defined stability constraints must be\nfollowed.\n\n(3) Document system Resource patterns and transmission configurations\n\nexpected during the time work is to occur, i.e., Resources and\ntransmission facilities out-of-service, Resources required to be in-service,\netc.\n\n\n-----\n\n(4) Interchange schedules, flows across pre determined interfaces and/or\n\nflows on major inter-RCA/BAA tie lines.\n\n(5) Determine action required prior to beginning work and after work has\n\nbegun to ensure compliance with OP-19.\n\n(6) Determine bulk power supply area protection Resource requirements\n\n(units and energy availability).\n\n(7) Determine \"locked in\" Resources. Include Resources that must be left\n\noff-line, and on-line Resources that must be dispatched at reduced\nloads.\n\ne. When a conflict is identified, a Short-Term Transmission Outage request with\n\nthe Status of Submitted and Study should be repositioned before an Approved\nor Interim Approved outage is repositioned. Outage priority is established in\nSection VIII of this procedure.\n\nf. With respect to routine transmission or Resource maintenance, in the event\n\nthat a Resource outage conflicts with a requested Short-Term Transmission\nOutage, the Resource outage will normally have priority except in the seven\n(7) days immediately preceding the start of the Short-Term Transmission\nOutage in which case the outages will be prioritized according to the time at\nwhich the outage request is received. ISO may adjust this priority due to\nreliability concerns.\n\ng. Obtain approval or denial from adjacent NPCC RC/BA, if applicable.\n\nh. Approve or deny the request.\n\n**C. NOTIFICATIONS**\n\nWhen the review and assessment has been completed, ISO will communicate its\nconclusions to the appropriate LCCs and/or adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs. ISO will notify\nthose LCCs and adjacent NPCC RCs/BAs that received preliminary notification of\nthe requested work, even if that notification was from an agency other than ISO. If a\nResource outage position or reduction was revised or initiated during processing of\nthe Short-Term Transmission Outage request (i.e., to eliminate congestion), ISO will\ncontact the Resource owner to confirm the revision to their position.\n\n1. Notification in case of Approval\n\nWhen approving a Short-Term Transmission Outage request, ISO shall provide\nthe conclusions of its reliability study in sufficient detail that all affected systems\nrecognize the impact of the approved work. The conclusions should cover at\nleast those items listed in Section VI.B.2.d.\n\n2. Notification in case of Denial\n\nWhen giving a Short-Term Transmission Outage request denial notification, ISO\nshall state the reasons for denial. Those reasons shall be specific and relate to\nitems listed in Section VI.B.2.d or to achieve Significantly Reduced Congestion\nCosts.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a Short Term Transmission Outage request for approval is denied, that\nrequest is considered completed. To accomplish the work, a new request must\nbe submitted as described in Section VI.D.\n\n3. Notification in case of Cancellation\n\nAn LCC or an adjacent NPCC RC/BA may subsequently cancel a Short-Term\nTransmission Outage request for work on a New England RCA/BAA facility that\nhas been forwarded to ISO.\n\nThe party initiating such action shall determine and communicate to other\naffected parties the specific reasons for the cancellation.\n\nOnce cancellation has been made, the Short-Term Transmission Outage request\nis considered completed. ISO shall notify the appropriate LCCs and adjacent\nNPCC RCs/BAs of the request status change. To accomplish the work, a new\nrequest shall be submitted as described in Section VI.D.\n\n4. Posting of Short-Term Transmission Outages\n\nFor transmission outages that are scheduled to occur from twenty (20) days up to\nand including Real-Time, ISO shall post each transmission outage (other than\nCancelled, Withdrawn or Denied) on the ISO external website in accordance with\nthe ISO New England Information Policy. Any revision shall be updated on the\nISO external website in a timely manner.\n\n**D. RE-SUBMITTAL**\n\nTo request approval of work that has been Denied or Cancelled, a new request with\na new request number and a new review and reliability study shall be processed as\nthough no previous request had been provided.\n\nThe one exception to this is when an \"Alternate Date\" has been supplied on the\noriginal request form. The “Alternate Date” is the working day following the last date\nfor the outage. In the event the \"Alternate Date\" is used for repositioning the work,\nthe existing request will be used and all necessary review and study shall again be\nprocessed for this work to be performed on the \"Alternate Date\".\n\n**VII. UNPLANNED OUTAGES**\n\n**A. SUBMISSION** **OF** **REQUESTS**\n\nThe following describes processes for providing requests (which will be processed\nper Section VI of this procedure) for the three different types of Unplanned Outages.\n\n1. **Emergency Outage**\n\nMPs shall submit requests for Emergency Outages of transmission facilities\nimmediately to the LCC. If the request is for Category A Facilities or Category B\nFacilities, the LCC shall immediately forward the request to ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. **Forced Outage**\n\nMPs shall notify their LCC as soon as the need for a Forced Outage is identified.\nThe LCC shall immediately notify ISO about the Forced Outage. The Forced\nOutage should not be officially submitted until the LCC has reasonable\nassurance from the MP that system conditions, crews and equipment are\navailable for the job.\n\n3. **Overrun Outage**\n\nMPs shall notify their LCC as soon as the need for an Overrun Outage is\nidentified and the LCC shall immediately communicate this information to ISO.\n\n**B. RESPONSE** **TO** **UNPLANNED** **OUTAGES**\n\nIf time exists while crews, equipment, and/or corrective dispatch action arrangements\nare being made, the LCC shall provide ISO with all pertinent information to allow for\nstudy of the outage and prioritization with other dispatch requirements.\n\nIn either event, the flow of information regarding the Unplanned Outage shall follow\nthe outlines shown on OP-3 Attachments 1 through 9. The timing requirements and\nvarious approval steps do not apply to most Unplanned Outages. Unplanned\nOutages shall be subject to ISO Market Monitoring review.\n\n**VIII. TRANSMISSION OUTAGE PRIORITY**\n\nWhen a conflict arises with another transmission outage previously scheduled, ISO shall\nattempt to resolve conflicting Long-Term and Short-Term Transmission Outage requests\nthrough discussions with the affected LCCs. When discussions cannot resolve the\nconflict, the respective priorities of the outages shall be established according to the\ntypes of outage and the outage status in the following order (highest to lowest priority):\n\n1. Unplanned Outage (Emergency or Forced)\n\n2. Long-Term Transmission Outage with Interim Approved Status and the Long\nTerm Economic Approval flag\n\n3. Long-Term Transmission Outage with Interim Approved Status\n\n4. Short-Term Outages\n\n5. Opportunity Outage\n\nIf the above priorities do not resolve the conflict, the earliest requested transmission\noutage shall have priority.\n\n**IX. OUTAGE WORK REPORTS**\n\n**A. LOCAL** **CONTROL** **CENTER** **TRANSMISSION** **WORK** **REPORT**\n\nDaily by 1000, each LCC shall forward to ISO and, if appropriate, to the adjacent\nLCCs a report that includes all equipment listed as Category B Facilities, which does\n**not affect Resource output that is to be worked on during the following day** (The\n\n\n-----\n\nSunday and Monday. Work on holidays shall be reported on the last regular\nweekday before the holiday). The report shall include outage times when work is to\nbegin and end.\n\nFollowing the Local Control Center Transmission Work Report, other reports from the\nLCC to ISO and, if appropriate, to the adjacent LCCs shall include any additional\nwork outage for the following day and/or outage work during the following day that is\ncancelled or postponed.\n\n**B. REVIEW** **OF** **TRANSMISSION** **WORK**\n\nOnce work has been approved and Local Control Center Transmission Work Reports\nhave been completed, both ISO and the LCCs shall operate according to the\npublished outage application times. The party initiating the change shall\ncommunicate any changes, for any reason. All affected parties shall be notified of\nthe change in work times.\n\nOn the night shift prior to the day the work is scheduled, ISO and the LCCs shall\ndiscuss the day's upcoming work to ensure that all parties are up-to-date on work\ntimes for switching and equipment work\n\nEach LCC shall confirm final approval of the transmission outage application by ISO\nSecurity Operator before switching begins. ISO shall be informed immediately when\nequipment is taken out-of-service and/or restored to service.\n\n**X. ANNUAL REPORT ON OUTAGE PROCESSING**\n\nISO, in coordination with the LCCs and PTOs, shall prepare and issue an annual report\non transmission outages and coordination. The report shall assess accuracy of inputs\nand calculation of congestion cost savings. The long-term impacts of ISO, LCC and\nPTO changes to outages shall be assessed and identify potential opportunities to further\nminimize congestion costs identified.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Document History (This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL Procedure prior to the**\nRTO Operations Date as well revisions made to the ISO New England Procedure subsequent to the RTO Operations\nDate.)\n\n|Rev.

The following are examples of\nequipment that is critical to BES reliability:\n\n   - Computers\n\n   - Metering, telemetering and control equipment\n\n   - Communications equipment (including the shared telecommunications\n\nnetwork)\n\n   - Computer support equipment\n\n   - Inter and intra-net systems and associated equipment\n\nThis OP also establishes the process for ISO’s consideration of proposed equipment\nmaintenance and outages. ISO has the ultimate authority for approval of proposed\nmaintenance and outages.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuppo t qu p e t\n\n**PART II - SCOPE**\n\nThis OP covers certain critical equipment located at:\n\n    - Main Control Centers[1] (MCCs) and Backup Control Centers (BCCs) for:\n```\n    o ISO \n    o CONVEX\n    o Maine\n    o New Hampshire\n    o NGRID\n    o NSTAR\n    o RIE\n    o VELCO\n\n```\n    - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition[2] (SCADA) Centers located at:\n```\n     o Versant Power\n     o National Grid Companies\n     o United Illuminating Company\n\n```\n   - Microwave and communication facilities located remotely from ISO and the\n\nLocal Control Centers (LCCs), that have an impact on operations\n\nOP-2A - Itemized Equipment Maintenance of Communications, Computers, Metering\nand Building Services (OP-2A) lists equipment that affects the reliability of the BES\nin the New England RCA/BAA.\n\nIn order to promote efficient repair or maintenance of critical equipment, the\nfollowing aspects of repair and maintenance work are covered in this OP:\n\n    - Criteria for repair/maintenance priority\n\n    - Establishment of criteria\n\n    - Responsibility for repair/maintenance\n\n   - Scheduling of routine maintenance\n\n   - Performance of routine and emergency/unplanned maintenance (day of)\n\n1 Control Center is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n2 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC\n\nReliability Standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuppo t qu p e t\n\n**PART III - PROCEDURE**\n\n**I.** **CRITERIA FOR REPAIR/MAINTENANCE (PRIORITY)**\n\nThe following criteria identify required response times to begin repair of failed\nequipment. The times are based upon the importance of the equipment to\nsystem operations. These same criteria are used to prioritize requests made for\nequipment maintenance.\n\n**A. Class A (immediate)**\n\nThis highest priority for repair or maintenance applies to equipment that is\ncritical to maintain adequate system security and reasonable economic\ndispatch. The classification of immediate is assigned for critical equipment\nthat must be returned to service as soon as possible. It is expected that\nthese repairs or maintenance activities will be conducted continuously until\nreturned to service.\n\n**B. Class B (regular working hours weekdays - except when they are more**\n\n**than sixteen (16) hours removed)**\n\nThis intermediate priority is intended for the temporary loss of equipment that\ncan be tolerated for limited periods of time, but may not be tolerated for\nprolonged periods of time.\n\n**C. Class C (regular working hours)**\n\nThis is the preferred priority for the performance of all repairs and\nmaintenance. It applies to all equipment not covered in Part III.I. Sections A\nor B.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuppo t qu p e t\n\n**II.** **ESTABLISHMENT OF CRITERIA**\n\n**A.** Under normal conditions, the criteria (priority classification) for maintenance\n\nof various equipment affecting ISO operations is established in OP-2A.\n\n**B.** Under either emergency or abnormal conditions, the ISO System Operators\n\nand/or the LCC or SCADA Center System Operator(s) have the authority and\nresponsibility to change the criteria established in OP-2A. If any criterion is\nchanged, it shall be communicated to the ISO System Operators.\n\n**III.** **RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIR/MAINTENANCE**\n\n**A. Assignment of Repair/Maintenance Responsibility**\n\nIn most instances, the location of the equipment determines who has the\nresponsibility for repair or maintenance. Equipment located at a specific LCC\nor SCADA Center is generally the responsibility of that Control Center.\nEquipment located at ISO is an ISO responsibility. Repair or maintenance of\nmicrowave or other communication facilities used in support of ISO operation\nbut not owned by ISO, shall be the responsibility of the owner.\n\n**B. Repair Work**\n\nAn equipment failure shall be responded to within the time requirements\nprescribed in Section I. Repair work status shall be communicated among all\naffected parties.\n\n**C. Coordination of Maintenance**\n\nISO shall coordinate all maintenance on equipment listed in OP-2A. This\nincludes the scheduling, approval or denial of requests for planned\nmaintenance, and the change in criteria classification in the event of an\nemergency or abnormal condition. LCC and SCADA Center System\nOperators also have the authority and responsibility to effect temporary\nchanges to the criteria established in OP-2A.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuppo t qu p e t\n\n**IV.** **SCHEDULING OF ROUTINE MAINTENANCE**\n\nA request for arranging advance schedules for routine maintenance on any\nequipment affecting ISO shall be submitted to the ISO Outage Coordinator via\nthe contact listed in OP-2, Appendix B ISO/Local Control Center/SCADA Center\nOP-2 Staff (OP-2B), which contains a table of maintenance contacts. Each\ncontact listed in OP-2B shall obtain operational approval at his or her facility prior\nto submitting a maintenance request to a higher level facility, LCC or ISO, in the\napproval process.\n\nWhenever maintenance is being performed at any LCC, or SCADA Center, an\nISO IT technician shall be available to the ISO System Operators should the\nneed arise for technical assistance during the outage.\n\nIn the event that the timelines described in Sections IV.A., IV.B., and IV.C.\n**cannot be complied with due to unforeseen circumstances, the ISO Outage**\nCoordinator shall consider a maintenance request on a short notice basis.

However, you shouldn’t rely solely on this web guide. Consult the *[ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff)* (ISO Tariff), Section II, known as the ISO’s *[Open Access Transmission Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff/oatt)* (OATT), and relevant [planning procedures](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/planning-procedures/) and [operating procedures](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/operating-procedures/) to ensure that you are complying with all requirements. In case of any discrepancy with this web guide, the ISO Tariff and applicable operating procedures and planning procedures govern.\n\n\nOverview of the Interconnection Process\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nAs a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), the ISO coordinates how transmission lines, power plants, and other resources connect to and operate on New England’s administered transmission system to ensure reliability and facilitate wholesale electricity market participation. The ISO does not administer the interconnection process for projects subject to state interconnection processes. Thus, [after you determine that the ISO interconnection process applies to your project](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/applications-status-changes/interconnection-process-guide/is-the-interconnection-process-right-for-you), you’ll need to submit an interconnection request to the ISO through the [Interconnection Request Tracking Tool](https://irtt.iso-ne.com/account/login) (IRTT). Existing customers can register for an account using [IRTT](https://irtt.iso-ne.com/account/login), while new customers must first or simultaneously obtain an ISO customer ID and access to critical energy infrastructure information.\n\n\nAs required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order No. 2023, it is only possible to submit interconnection requests during a cluster request window. The next window to submit a complete interconnection request package for the next Cluster Study is expected to be open from October 6, 2025 to November 20, 2025\\. After the ISO validates your interconnection request and the cluster request window closes, the customer engagement window opens and a cluster study scoping meeting is held. A cluster study scoping meeting will address pertinent information about your project and the interconnection studies the ISO will perform to assess your project’s impact on the power system and the facilities and upgrades potentially needed to interconnect your project per all requirements and standards.\n\n\nAfter the ISO has completed the necessary study work, you’ll work with the ISO and the transmission owner on an Interconnection Agreement (IA), a formal document detailing the terms and conditions for interconnection service. You must enter into an IA before you can construct or operate a generator or an elective transmission upgrade. Final steps of the interconnection process are to submit final data and register your asset with the ISO.\n\n\n[![Get started with the interconnection guide process](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/img/get-started-with-ig-process.jpg)](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/applications-status-changes/interconnection-process-guide/is-the-interconnection-process-right-for-you)\n\n\nGoverning Documents\n-------------------\n\n\nSeveral schedules of the ISO’s *[Open Access Transmission Tariff](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/tariff/oatt)* contain the rules detailing the interconnection process:\n\n\n* [Section II, *ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff*](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/regulatory/tariff/sect_2/oatt/sect_ii.pdf) (OATT)  \n\n\t+ Helps ensure that all transmission owners and transmission customers have open access to transmission service in New England\n\t+ Details the rights and responsibilities of transmission owners and transmission customers as well as the procedures they must follow and the fees transmission customers must pay to access the transmission system\n\t+ Sets out the transmission system planning process for the region\n* [Schedule 22, *Large Generator Interconnection Procedures*](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/regulatory/tariff/sect_2/sch22/sch_22_lgip.pdf) (LGIPs)—the terms and conditions for interconnecting large generating facilities (\\> 20 MW) to the administered transmission system.\n* [Schedule 23, *Small Generator Interconnection Procedures*](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/regulatory/tariff/sect_2/sch23/sch_23_sgip.pdf) (SGIPs)—the terms and conditions for interconnecting small generating facilities (≤ 20 MW) to the administered transmission system.\n* [Schedule 25, *Elective Transmission Upgrade Interconnection Procedures*](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2015/02/sch_25.pdf) (ETUs)—the terms and conditions for interconnecting a new pool transmission facility (PTF), merchant transmission facility (MTF), or other transmission system to the administered transmission system.\n* [ISO Operating Procedure No. 14](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/operating-procedures) (OP 14\\), *Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Resources, and Asset Related Demands*—describes the minimum technical requirements for generators.\n* [ISO Planning Procedure No. 5\\-6](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/rules-procedures/planning-procedures) (PP 5\\-6\\), *Scope of Study for System Impact Studies under the Generation Interconnection Procedures*—describes the scope of interconnection studies conducted pursuant to Schedule 22, Schedule 23, and Schedule 25\\.\n\n\nResources and Tools\n-------------------\n\n\n* For additional resources for the Interconnection Process see [Interconnection Service](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/interconnection-service/).\n* [“Interconnection Process”](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/training/materials/?eventId=148076) training is available on the [Training Materials webpage](https://www.iso-ne.com/participate/training/materials/?key-topic=Forward%20Capacity%20Market%20Training).\n* [See the IRTT public queue](https://irtt.iso-ne.com/reports/external).

Purpose\n\nThis Procedure, Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 22 - Emergency\nPreparedness Conference Call Procedure (M/LCC 22), establishes communication\nprotocols among the members (or alternates) of the M/LCC Heads group and/or an\nOperations Executives group. Each of these groups consists of a member (and alternate)\nfrom ISO New England (ISO) and companies associated with each of the Local Control\nCenters (LCCs) within New England.\n\n# 2. Introduction\n\nThe ISO Manager, Control Room Operations, maintains the list of members of the M/LCC\nHeads and Operations Executives groups referenced within this document and is\naccessible via the links contained within Attachment A - Contact and Conference Call\nInformation (Attachment A) of this Procedure. This Procedure facilitates the ability of the\nM/LCC Heads and/or Operations Executives to discuss issues related to the adequacy\nand security of the interconnected Bulk Electric System (BES) of New England or the\nbroader Interconnection.\n\nThis M/LCC Emergency Preparedness Conference Call mechanism is a tool that\naugments routine communications during those times when an acute situation requires\nrapid and efficient communication regarding the status of current operating conditions and\ndevelopment of an action plan to resolve any abnormal and/or emergency condition(s).\nTo enhance efficiency, participation in M/LCC Emergency Preparedness Conference Calls\nis usually limited to members (or alternates) of the M/LCC Heads, to facilitate prompt\naction when a tactical response is required to resolve an acute situation. However, when\na more strategic discussion may be required in response to a more impactful situation, it is\nintended that the members (or alternates) of the Operations Executives group would\nconduct an M/LCC Emergency Preparedness Conference Call, either separately or\ntogether with the M/LCC Heads,\n\n# 3. Responsibilities\n\n1. The ISO Vice President, System Operations & Market Administration (or alternate) is\n\nresponsible for initiating and coordinating an M/LCC Emergency Preparedness\nConference Call among the Operations Executives, as requested or as needed.\n\n2.

Interconnection/Synchronization Checklist User Guide\n\n The purpose of this checklist is to provide the user a means to evaluate conditions between two islands prior to interconnecting/synchronizing - either inside New England herein to be referred to as an LCC-to-LCC synchronization, or between New England and another Reliability Coordinator Area referred to as an RCA-to-RCA synchronization. The worksheet is intended to complement the System Operator Rules of Thumb outlined in M/LCC 18 Attachment G - System Restoration Strategies. This allows the System Operators in both islands to document conditions on a common worksheet and to give a basic overview of each island for assessment before interconnecting/synchronizing.\n\n  Row A: Identify whether you are pursuing an LCC-to-LCC or an RCA-to-RCA\n synchronization\n\n  Row B: List the names of the islands under consideration for\n interconnection/synchronization. If the island does not have a predetermined name, establish and agree to a name based on island geographic and/or LCC location\n\n  Row C: List the approximate load for each island to be interconnected/synchronized\n\n  Row D: Perform a synchronous reserve assessment. List the generation on-line within\n each island and assess the capacity, energy, largest generation contingency and synchronous reserve within each island where:\n```\n      o Capacity = rated MW output\n      o Energy = actual MW output\n      o Largest contingency = largest single source of energy\n      o Synchronous reserve = Amount of generation increase available within 10 minutes\n\n Compare results of both islands and determine if sufficient synchronous reserve exists\n\n  Row E: Estimate the frequency excursions for both islands over the previous 30 minutes,\n which provide a condition of the relative stability of the island. If the frequency has been deemed unstable, System Operators may wish to hold off from interconnecting/synchronizing until island conditions stabilize\n\n  Row F: Perform a synchronization assessment with regard to the criteria stated in\n M/LCC18G\n\n  Row G: Identify the interconnection/synchronization location for the two islands\n\n  Row H: Determine which island resource(s) will control frequency \n\n  Row I: Determine which entity will control tie-line flow \n\n  Row J: Determine which entity will coordinate the actual island\n interconnection/synchronization - typically the entity that has control of the\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment N Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\n### synchronization breaker\n\n  Row K: List any specific notes of interest such as agreed-upon tie-line flow schedule,\n thermal ratings of the interconnecting tie-line, and conditions that would be required to open the tie-line\n\n  Row L: ISO-NE Approval Name, Date and Time\n\n II.

Purpose\n\nThis document describes the comprehensive “Operating Plan” of both ISO New England\n(ISO) and the Local Control Centers (LCCs) to prepare for and mitigate Operating\nEmergencies on the Bulk Electric System (BES) in the New England Reliability Control\nArea (RCA). This Operating Plan is comprised of this procedure as well as the other\nprocedures identified herein. The purpose of this Operating Plan is to identify ISO and LCC\nroles, responsibilities and processes to prepare for and mitigate Operating Emergencies.\nThe provisions of the Operating Plan also assist to meet certain requirements of North\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards, including the\nfollowing:\n\n    - EOP-011 Emergency Operations\n\n    - IRO-014 Coordination Among Reliability Coordinators\n\n    - TOP-001 Transmission Operations\n\n# 3. Introduction\n\n**NOTE**\n\nISO, performing actions as a Reliability Coordinator (RC), Balancing Authority (BA) and\nTransmission Operator (TOP) and the LCCs, performing actions as TOPs, implement the\nprocedures identified as part of the Operating Plan to prepare for and mitigate abnormal and\nemergency system conditions. The term “Operating Emergency” as defined by ISO and the\nLCCs in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 13 - ISO and LCC Communication\nPractices (M/LCC 13) and as used in ISO and LCC procedures fully encompasses the\nNERC terms “Emergency”, “BES Emergency”, “Capacity Emergency” and “Energy\nEmergency” defined in the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC Reliability Standards.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nRelated implementing procedures, such as ISO Control Room Operating Procedures\n(CROPs) and LCC-specific implementing procedures are not considered part of the\nOperating Plan.\n\nISO and LCC responsibilities and actions listed in this Operating Plan are described at a\nhigh level. The specifics of the actions are contained in the identified associated OPs and\nM/LCC Procedures.\n\nAs detailed in Section 5.1, the following documents are considered part of the Operating\nPlan to prepare for and mitigate Operating Emergencies:\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 4 - Action During a Capacity Deficiency\n\n(OP-4)\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 7 - Action in an Emergency (OP-7)\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2022|Master/LCC Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating Emergencies Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: December 7, 2022|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|\n\n\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 13 - Standards for Voltage Reduction\n\nand Load Shedding Capability (OP-13)\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for\n\nGenerators, Demand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative\nTechnology Regulation Resources (OP-14)\n\n    - ISO Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19)\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 21 - Operational Surveys, Energy\n\nForecasting & Reporting and Actions During An Energy Emergency (OP-21)\n\n    - ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 23 - Resource Auditing (OP-23)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert (M/LCC 2)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 4 - Emergency Load Reduction Plans for\n\nMitigating IROL Violations (M/LCC 4)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 13 - ISO and LCC Communication\n\nPractices (M/LCC 13)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits\n\nMethodology (M/LCC 15)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 16 - Seasonal Preparations (M/LCC 16)\n\n    - Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating\n\nEmergencies (M/LCC 20)\n\n# 4.

The respective responsibilities of ISO and the LCCs for performing actions specified in\nthe various documents that constitute the ISO and LCC Operating Plan for mitigating\nOperating Emergencies are specified in Operating Plan documents.\n\n3. As part of its normal periodic review of this procedure and other procedures that are\npart of the Operating Plan, in coordination with the LCCs, ISO is responsible for\nensuring that the responsibilities and identified actions of ISO and the LCCs are\ncompatible and coordinated, so as to avoid wide-area reliability risks.\n\n4. Each LCC is responsible for working with ISO to modify this procedure, as necessary,\nto address any reliability risks identified by ISO during its review of this procedure.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2022|Master/LCC Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating Emergencies Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: December 7, 2022|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|\n\n\n# 5. Instructions\n\n**5.1 ISO and LCC Preparation for and Mitigation of Operating Emergencies**\n\nA. Actions to be taken by ISO and LCC System Operators to prepare for and mitigate\n\nOperating Emergencies are described below.\n\n_Energy Emergency Alerts_\n\n1. ISO shall make a Reliability Coordinator Information System (RCIS) posting to\ndeclare an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) whenever it takes the actions\ndescribed below:\n```\n      o EEA level 1 - when ISO implements OP-4 Action 2, or when ISO cancels all of\n\n```\nOP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10, and 11, one or more of which it had previously\nimplemented\n```\n      o EEA level 2 - when ISO implements OP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10 or 11 or when ISO\n\n```\ncancels OP-7 actions it had previously implemented\n```\n      o EEA level 3 - when OP-7 load shedding actions directed by ISO are imminent\n\n```\nor have been implemented\n```\n      o EEA level 0 - when ISO has declared an EEA level 1, and has taken both of\n\n```\nthe following actions:\n\n(1) when ISO cancels all of OP-4 Actions 6, 8, 10, and 11, one or more of\n\nwhich it had previously implemented; and\n\n(2) ISO also cancels OP-4 Action 2\n\n2. During an EEA level 2, ISO shall:\n```\n      o Notify neighboring RCs/BAs and Designated Entities (DEs) and Demand\n\n```\nDesignated Entities (DDEs) to communicate its needs\n```\n      o Update the energy deficiency information posted on the RCIS website as\n\n```\nchanges occur and pass this information on to the neighboring RCs/BAs and\nLCCs\n```\n      o Review transmission outages and work with the TOP(s) to determine if it is\n\n```\npossible to return to service any transmission elements that may relieve the\nloading on System Operating Limits (SOLs) or Interconnection Reliability\nOperating Limits (IROLs)\n\n3. While in an EEA level 2, before declaring an EEA level 3, the ISO must have\nmade full use of all available Resources, including but not limited to:\n```\n      o All generation is on-line that is capable of being on-line in the time frame of the\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2022|Master/LCC Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating Emergencies Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: December 7, 2022|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|\n\n\nOperating Emergency\n```\n    o Activation of all Demand-Side Management available in the time frame of the\n\n```\nOperating Emergency and within the provisions of applicable agreements\n\n4. During an EEA level 3 ISO shall:\n```\n    o Continue to take all actions initiated during EEA level 2\n    o Update the energy deficiency information posted on the RCIS website as\n\n```\nchanges occur and pass this information on to the neighboring RCs/BAs and\nLCCs\n```\n    o Evaluate the risks of revising SOLs and IROLs for the possibility of mitigating\n\n```\nthe energy deficiency, in coordination with neighboring RC/BAs and with the\nagreement of any LCC that has Transmission Owner (TO) equipment that\nwould be affected. System Operating Limits (SOLs) and Interconnection\nReliability Operating Limits (IROLs) shall only be revised as long as an EEA 3\ncondition exists, or as allowed by the TO whose equipment is at-risk.\n\n5. During any EEA declared by another RC, ISO shall coordinate with the energy\ndeficient RC, as appropriate.\n\n_Coordination Among Reliability Coordinators (RCs)_\n\n6. If ISO and another RC disagree on the existence of an Operating Emergency that\n\npotentially impacts one or both of them, ISO shall:\n```\n    o Operate as though the Operating Emergency exists\n    o Develop an action plan to resolve the Operating Emergency, if ISO is the RC\n\n```\nthat identifies the Operating Emergency in the ISO RCA\n```\n    o Implement the action plan developed by the RC that identifies the Operating\n\n```\nEmergency, unless such actions would violate safety, equipment, regulatory,\nor statutory requirements\n\n_ISO Assistance to LCCs and RCs_\n\n7. ISO shall assist LCCs and RCs that are experiencing Operating Emergencies, if\n\nrequested and able, provided that the requesting entity has implemented its\nemergency procedures, unless such assistance involves actions that cannot be\nphysically implemented or would violate safety, equipment, regulatory, or statutory\nrequirements.\n\n_LCC Assistance to other LCCs_\n\n8. Each LCC shall assist other LCCs that are experiencing Operating Emergencies, if\n\nrequested and able, provided that the requesting entity has implemented its\nemergency procedures, unless such assistance involves actions that cannot be\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2022|Master/LCC Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating Emergencies Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: December 7, 2022|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|\n\n\nphysically implemented or would violate safety, equipment, regulatory, or statutory\nrequirements.\n\n_Other Actions by ISO and LCCs_\n\n9.

Review of Operating Plan Documents\n\n**NOTE**\n\nFor purposes of meeting NERC Standard EOP-011, ISO and each LCC maintain the\ndocuments that are part of the Operating Plan by reviewing them as part of the normal\nM/LCC Heads process for reviewing, updating and approving OP and M/LCC procedures.\nAs part of this process, ISO also adheres to SOP-RTMKTS.0210.0010 - Develop, Revise\n& Control SOP, OP, M/LCC Documents. This process is how ISO and the LCCs address\napplicable EOP-011 requirements for:\n\n1. the LCC to submit an Operating Plan document to ISO;\n\n2. ISO to review that Operating Plan document;\n\n3. ISO and LCCs to address any reliability risks in the Operating Plan document; and\n\n4. ISO to notify the LCC of the results of its review of the Operating Plan document.\n\nAll of these actions regarding an Operating Plan document (LCC submittal to ISO, ISO\nreview, ISO/LCC modification of document to address identified reliability risks and ISO\nnotification to LCCs of the results of its review) are all considered to occur on the same\nday that the M/LCC Heads (ISO and the LCCs) conduct their final review and approval of\na given revision of the document\n\nA. As part of its review of an Operating Plan document, ISO shall ensure that the various\n\nresponsibilities and identified actions of ISO and the LCCs identified in the Operating\nPlan document are compatible and coordinated with other Operating Plan documents,\nwith consideration of inter-dependency of the various Operating Plan documents, so as\nto avoid wide-area reliability risks.\n\nB. ISO and each LCC shall work together to address any reliability risks identified by ISO\n\nduring such reviews, by modifying each appropriate Operating Plan document, as\nnecessary.\n\nC. The ISO shall have the authority to modify Operating Procedures or develop new\n\nOperating Procedures without such coordination or consultation when the ISO does not\nhave sufficient time to undertake such coordination or consultation due to emergent\nand unanticipated circumstances.\n\nD. The ISO shall have the authority, as the System Operator with ultimate authority for the\n\nReal-Time operation of the New England Transmission System, to implement any new\nOperating Procedures or modified Operating Procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2022|Master/LCC Procedure No. 20 - Operating Plan for Operating Emergencies Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: December 7, 2022|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: December 7, 2024|\n\n\n**7.** **M/LCC 20 Revision History**\n\n**Rev.

During a GMD event, geomagnetically-induced currents (GIC) may\ncause transformer hot-spot heating or damage, loss of Reactive Power sources,\nincreased Reactive Power demand, and Protection System misoperation, the\ncombination of which may result in voltage collapse and blackout.\n\n**4.** **Responsibilities**\n\n1. ISO and the LCCs are each responsible for developing, maintaining and\n\nimplementing this procedure to mitigate the effects of GMD events on the\nreliable operation of the ISO RCA.\n\n2. As part of its normal periodic review of this procedure in coordination with the\n\nLCCs, ISO is responsible for verifying that the ISO and LCC actions and\nprocesses specified within are coordinated.\n\n3.

The following is a high-level list of the activities designed to mitigate the effects\n\nof GMD events on the reliable operation of the ISO RCA.\n\n    - Obtain information regarding current and forecasted space weather\n\npertaining to actual and expected GMD activity from various sources. Such\ninformation is reflected in an assigned GMD intensity level index (ISO uses\nthe \"K\" index, where an index of 5 or 6 indicates a major GMD storm and an\nindex of 7 or greater indicates a severe GMD storm). The primary source\nfor this information is the Solar Terrestrial Dispatch (STD) Geomagnetic\nStorm Mitigation System (GSMS). The STD GSMS software provides an\nalert for forecasted and actual GMD events of K 6 or greater. For the\npurposes of this procedure, a GMD event is an actual or expected GMD\nstorm that is assigned a \"K\" index of 6 or greater.\n\n     - When ISO is notified of actual or expected GMD activity and that activity is\n\n(or is forecast to be) a major GMD storm (“K” index is greater than or equal\nto 6) or a severe GMD storm (i.e., when the “K” index is greater than or\nequal to 7), review the GIC activity on the available monitors via SCADA.\n\n     - When ISO is notified of actual or expected GMD activity and that activity is\n\n(or is forecast to be) a severe GMD storm (i.e., when the “K” index is greater\nthan or equal to 7), notify entities of GMD space weather information,\nincluding intensity (as reflected in the assigned “K” index), duration and\nprobability (for an Alert). In some cases this notification may include a\nrequest that an entity take certain action(s). Such entities include:\n```\n     o LCCs\n     o Designated Entities (DEs) and Demand Designated Entities (DDEs) for\n\n```\nNew England Generators and Demand Resources\n\n    - Document GMD events in the Control Room Event Logserver and the\n\nMorning Report\n\n    - Evaluate conflicting information received regarding a GMD event (if any) and\n\nrequest clarification, as needed, to resolve any discrepancies\n\n    - Evaluate current and forecasted operating information for possible action(s)\n\nthat may need to be taken to address a GMD event including\nimplementation of procedure M/LCC 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert\n\n    - Take appropriate action(s) to address a GMD event, consulting with LCCs\n\nas necessary\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 19 - Geomagnetic Disturbance Operating Plan Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: February 20, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 20, 2026|\n\n\n\n    - Document the action(s) taken to address a GMD event\n\n    - Determine when the GMD event is terminated\n\n    - Notify entities of GMD event termination\n\n**5.2 LCC Activities Designed to Mitigate Effect of GMD Events**\n\n1. Receiving space weather information\n\n    - LCCs receive GMD space weather information from ISO, including intensity\n\n(as reflected in the assigned “K” index), duration and probability (for an\nAlert) for severe GMD storms (forecasted and actual GMD events of K 7 or\ngreater)\n\n2. LCC actions to be initiated based on predetermined conditions\n\nA. Each LCC logs receipt of GMD space weather information from ISO\n\nB. Each LCC consults and coordinates with ISO regarding actions that ISO\n\nand/or the LCC(s) could take to address a GMD event. Such actions could\ninclude, but not be limited to:\n```\n     o Discontinue maintenance and avoid taking lines out-of-service\n     o Closely monitor voltage-related contingencies and maintain system\n\n```\nvoltages\n```\n     o Monitor and dispatch Resources to manage system voltage\n\n```\nC. Each LCC takes local action to address unusual MVAr loadings and notifies\n\nISO of any unusual MVAr loading or voltage swings during a GMD event\n\nD. Each LCC takes actions to address a GMD event as requested by ISO\n\nE. Each LCC may take other actions to address a GMD event, as necessary to\n\npreserve the reliability of the Bulk Electric System (BES) within their\nrespective LCC footprint and notify ISO of such actions\n\nF. Each LCC logs actions that it takes to address a GMD Event\n\nG. The LCC Operator notifies ISO whenever there is a > 20 amps GIC alarm\n\nfrom available GIC monitoring points if SCADA data or ICCP is unavailable.\n\n3. Conditions for terminating this procedure\n\n    - The LCCs consider this procedure terminated when they receive notification\n\nof the termination of the GMD event from ISO\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 19 - Geomagnetic Disturbance Operating Plan Revision Number: 4 Revision Date: February 20, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 20, 2026|\n\n\n**6.** **Review of GMD Plans and Procedures**\n\nReview of this document by ISO and each LCC will take place as part of the\nnormal review cycle for M/LCC documents, or more often, as necessary.

While the\nworksheet can be used for energizing all 345 kV lines, the primary application is for 345 kV\nelements not identified in ISO New England Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18\n– New England System Restoration Plan (M/LCC 18), Attachment A System Restoration\nFlowchart (M/LCC18A). Even though the stated 345 kV elements in M/LCC18A have been\nsubject to Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) and steady-state evaluations, it is\nrecommended to use the worksheet to determine the cumulative effect on reactive margins\nwhile energizing 345 kV transmission elements since Real-Time system conditions may\nsignificantly differ from study assumptions.\n\nAttachment G columns can be broken into four main sections:\n\n   - Task description - what line is being energized and when\n\n  - Resource information - Columns 1 and 2\n\n   - Energization information - Columns 3 through 5\n\n   - Decision to energize - Columns 6 and 7\n\nISO New England Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System\nRestoration Plan (M/LCC18) Attachment G - System Restoration Strategies (M/LCC18G),\nthis document, provides for the decision to energize to be determined as a result of\ncomparing reactive Resources to energization information. This is an arithmetic analysis\nonly; it is strongly recommended that System Operators confer with their respective\nengineering support group prior to energizing alternate paths, that are not identified in\nM/LCC18A, during system restoration.\n\nEnergization of a 345 kV element that is performed outside of the studied paths should be\nevaluated, by ISO and the applicable LCC(s) System Operator/s, using M/LCC18G.\n\nThe worksheet is filled out sequentially and values are cumulative; only columns that are\napplicable will contain information.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G Revision Number: 7 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nAs a result of electromagnetic transient studies using the EMTP analysis software, a\n“thumb-rule” of 150 MVA of dynamic reactive Resources (i.e., spinning generation or\nsynchronous condensers) has been determined to provide sufficient transient dynamic\nreactive capability to maintain acceptable transient over-voltage during 345 kV element\nenergizations that are not specified in M/LCC18 A. However, since a Generator MVA\nrating value is typically found on the Generator nameplate data sheet and is not readily\navailable to System Operators during a system restoration event, a Generator MW rating\nvalue will be used in lieu of MVA rating value. Typically a Generator is rated in terms of\nmaximum MVA output at a specific voltage and power factor (usually 0.85 to 0.9 lagging).\nFor example, a 150 MVA rated Generator with a 0.9 lagging power factor will have a 135\nMW rating (150 MVA * 0.9). Therefore using 150 MW of on-line Generator capability will,\ngenerally, exceed the 150 MVA of on-line capability and will result in a more acceptable\ntransient over-voltage performance.\n\nThe term electrically close (or “near”) is used when dealing with an island with multiple\nResources that are not at the same electrical interconnection point. When there are\nmultiple Resources available within an island for consideration in energizing a 345 kV\nline, the electrically closest Resources in the island should be used when determining if\nthe 150 MW requirement is met.\n\nStarting a synchronous condenser can cause a short, large voltage depression and the\nengineering support group should be consulted prior to energization.\n\nFor the purposes of these calculations, synchronous condenser MW equals the\nsynchronous condenser MVA rating.\n\nA. Column 1 is to determine that sufficient transient dynamic reactive capability exists to\n\nmaintain acceptable transient over-voltages during the 345 kV element energization.\nThe user must enter “Y” if the total MW capability of all on-line Resources is more\nthan 150 MW or enter “N” if the total MW capability of all on-line Resources is less\nthan 150 MW. If “N” then energization is not permitted using this worksheet and\neither:\n\n1) More Resource capacity should be brought on-line or;\n\n2) Detailed engineering studies should be performed to determine whether\n\nenergization can occur.\n\nB. Columns 2 through 6 require the user to enter the appropriate information and\n\nperform the indicated mathematical function.\n\n1) Column 2 identifies the available Resource Lead MVAR absorbing capability that\n\nis “near” the 345 kV energization. This value translates as the total MVAR\nabsorbing capability. The term “near” is used to indicate that the electrical\nproximity of the available Resource to the point of energization is critical and\nshould be considered prior to the 345 kV element energization. System\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G Revision Number: 7 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nOperators are advised to work with engineering staff to determine whether the\navailable Resources are electrically close to (or “near”) the 345 kV energization.\nOne variable to determine if a Resource is “near” the 345 kV element under\nconsideration is the Resource’s ability to control voltage at the point of\nenergization.\n\n2) Column 3 identifies the expected charging of the 345 kV element being evaluated.\n\nThe charging value at NOMINAL voltage can be obtained from ISO New England\nMaster/Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System\nRestoration Plan (M/LCC18) Attachment C Charging of 345 kV Circuits in New\nEngland (M/LCC18C).\n\n3) Column 4 identifies Reactor MVAR, if any, that will be energized simultaneously\n\nwith the transmission element being evaluated. If no reactors will be energized\nwith the element, this value will remain zero (0).\n\n4) Column 5 is the Net MVAR charging from the 345 kV transmission element being\n\nenergized. This value is the difference of Columns 3 and 4. The value in this\ncolumn will be entered on the right side of the comparison equation in Column 6\nas the “Net MVAR Charging”.\n\nC. Column 6 is used to determine that sufficient leading capability exists to absorb all the\n\nMVAR Charging from the element to be energized and maintain acceptable steady\nstate voltages.\n\n1) Column 6 is the difference between the available Resource Lead MVAR capability\n\n(column 2) and Net MVAR Charging (column 5).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nEnergizing 345 kV cables should not be attempted until later stages of system\nrestoration. Rules of Thumb will not be used for cable energizations. Cable energizations\nwill be completed through engineering evaluation.\n\nD. Column 7 requires that the answers in column 6 are greater than zero in order for the\n\ndecision to energize to be “Y”. System Operators should consider taking both of the\nfollowing actions prior to energizing 345 kV lines:\n\n1) Maintain Resource* voltages at nominal/minimal levels, and\n\n2) Create leading reactive reserve on Resources* by using loads and available\n\nreactors to absorb reactive power.\n\n*** Resources referred to above are those Resources considered in order to**\n\nsatisfy the inertia requirement (minimum 150 MW of generation capability) for\nenergizing 345 kV elements.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G Revision Number: 7 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\n## II. Restoration Strategy Rules of Thumb\n\n**A. Generation Restoration**\n\n1.Frequency Control\n\na. Monitor appropriate frequency for the island being controlled\n\nb. Maintain steady-state frequency 59.9-61.0 Hz\n\n2.Generation Loading\n\na. When possible, maintain minimum loading on each Generator to prevent loss of any\n\nGenerator, creating significant frequency excursion\n\nb. Increasing island inertia is beneficial to stable operation. Energizing additional\n\ntransmission elements, load, and generation will increase the island size and\ngeneration MW reserve in the island. These actions improve the likelihood an island\nwill ride-through a frequency excursion caused by a system disturbance.\n\n3.Load Shed\n\na. 6-10% of load shed in area produces ~1 Hz rise in frequency\n\n4.Regulation\n\na. Flat Frequency- New England is isolated or larger of interconnected areas\n\n(automatically changes AGC Bias to lower value)\n\nb. Tie-Line Bias- New England is smaller of interconnected areas\n\nc. Use multiple slower-moving Generators vs faster-moving to prevent frequency\n\nhunting\n\n**B. Load Restoration**\n\n1. Load Pick Up\n\na. Until operational experience shows otherwise, loads based on normal operating\n\nvalues for time, date and season should be restored in block sizes that do not\nexceed 5% of total synchronized generating capability\n\nb. When any Generator operating with the governor in isochronous (isolated, island)\n\nmode is operating in an island which also contains significant generation with the\ngovernors operating in droop (parallel, manual) mode:\n\ni. Monitor the isochronous unit loading as new load is energized and as cold\nload decreases.\n\n            - Ensure no overload of the isochronous unit occurs before transferring\n\nsome of its load to a droop unit with available capacity.\n\n            - Ensure cold load reduction does not threaten to trip the isochronous\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G Revision Number: 7 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nunit on reverse power.\n\n2.

INTRODUCTION**\n\nThis document, Master /Local Control Center Procedure No. 18 – New England System\nRestoration Plan (M/LCC 18) and the M/LCC 18 Attachments include strategies,\nguidelines, information and instructions that are to be used by ISO New England (ISO)\nand the Local Control Centers (LCCs) during implementation of the New England\nSystem Restoration Plan (the Plan) after a partial or total shutdown of the New England\nBulk Electric System (BES), which generally consists of facilities operated at voltages\nof 100 kV or higher. The Plan (as represented in its entirety by M/LCC 18 as well as all\nM/LCC18 Attachments) is the single New England regional system restoration plan that\nserves as both:\n\n   - the Transmission Operator (TOP) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-005) and\n\n   - the Reliability Coordinator (RC) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-006).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThese same M/LCC 18 documents also serve as the TOP restoration plan\n\nfor each Local Control Center (LCC).\n\nExpeditious system restoration of the BES depends on independent actions and interactions\nby ISO, LCCs and Market Participants (MPs). The expanse of the blackout (locally limited\nor regionally widespread) will determine the response by ISO, each LCC and each MP,\nincluding the procedures and/or instructions which may need to be implemented.\n\nThe major objectives of the Plan are to:\n\n1) Provide off-site ac power to the New England nuclear power stations\n\n2) Interconnect all New England Transmission Operators (TOPs) (i.e., the LCCs)\n\n3) Establish interconnections/synchronizations with contiguous Reliability Coordinator\n\nAreas (RCAs) that are normally synchronously connected to the New England RCA,\nadvancing system restoration of the Eastern Interconnection\n\nWhen these three objectives have been achieved and, in accordance with EOP-005, the\nchoice of the next load to be restored is not driven by the need to control frequency or\nvoltage, implementation of the Plan shall be considered to have been completed. ISO\nrecognizes that, upon completion of the Plan, LCC local recovery actions may still be\nongoing for the energization of remaining New England load. The local area recovery\nactions of each LCC are documented in their respective Local Area Recovery Instructions\n(LARIs), which are not part of the Plan. As necessary, ISO will continue to coordinate with\neach LCC when restoring load to remaining areas of New England, while each LCC\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nimplements its respective LARIs.[1]\n\nRecognizing the numerous possible system blackout scenarios (depending on the expanse\nof the blackout, Resources available for system restoration, etc.), knowledge and application\nof the guidelines, information and instructions contained in this document and related\nAttachments are critically important. This procedure provides for coordinated actions of ISO\nand other entities identified in the Plan (including each LCC, TOPs, Transmission Owners\n(TOs) and MPs). Coordination is especially important with respect to the technical aspects\nof system restoration (i.e., Generator startups, load pickups, switching surges, voltages,\nfrequency, synchronization of islands, etc.). ISO shall work with its affected LCCs and\nGenerator Operators (GOPs), as well as neighboring RCAs, to monitor system restoration\nprogress, coordinate system restoration, and take actions to restore the BES frequency\nwithin acceptable operating limits. ISO shall coordinate and authorize re-synchronizing\nislanded areas that bridge boundaries between the LCCs or between the ISO RCA and\nneighboring RCAs.\n\nThe ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (Tariff) provides for\nISO to enter into contractual arrangements with blackstart Generators that have the ability to\nbe started without support from the transmission system. Blackstart Generators are an\nessential element of the Plan.

Plan Implementation Criteria and System Assessment**\n\nThe ISO Operations Shift Supervisor shall determine whether to implement M/LCC 18 if\none or more of the following events occurs:\n\n   - A system disturbance results in a partial or complete blackout in which one or\n\nmore areas of the New England BES shuts down and the use of DBRs is required\nto re-energize the shutdown area(s) of the New England BES\n\n  - Separation has occurred between the ISO RCA and one or more neighboring\n\nRCA(s) and the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor determines that implementation\nof the Plan is necessary to interconnect/synchronize with the RCA(s)\n\n  - An energized island has been formed on the BES within the New England RCA\n\nand the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor determines that implementation of the\nPlan is necessary to resynchronize that island with the remainder of the ISO RCA\n\nIf M/LCC 18 is implemented, the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor shall:\n\n  - Make an entry in the Control Room Event Logserver.\n\n   - Post a “Notice” to the ISO external website.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nM/LCC 18 Attachment Q - System Restoration Checklist (Confidential) is expected to be\nused by the ISO Operations Shift Supervisor and by the LCC System Operators during\nthe stages of System Restoration.\n\n  - Following a complete or partial Blackout, use M/LCC 18 Attachment Q during the\n\nstages of System Restoration.\n\nIf M/LCC 18 is implemented, each LCC shall create a log entry to document this.\n\nThe ISO Restoration Coordinator and each applicable LCC restoration coordinator shall\nconduct a post-blackout-event system assessment. Based on this assessment, the ISO\nRestoration Coordinator shall determine the priority assigned to actions taken to achieve\nPlan objectives. The ISO Restoration Coordinator, in conjunction with the applicable\nLCC restoration coordinator(s), will coordinate the use of identified Plan Resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nRecognizing the nuclear power stations sensitivity to Coping Time during a complete\nloss of ac power, when both a Primary and Alternate Path are out-of-service at the same\ntime, a Temporary Plan is required when the M/LCC 7 Processing Outage Applications\n(M/LCC 7) criteria cannot be met. Temporary plans do not apply to paths for inter- or\nintra-area synchronization points. These paths are addressed by system restoration\nstrategies (M/LCC 18 Attachment G).\n\nThe System Restoration paths detailed in Attachment A - System Restoration Flowchart,\nachieve all Plan objectives. As listed below, Primary Paths only include paths from\nidentified DBRs to nuclear power stations.\n\nPrimary Paths LCC(s) Involved\n\nStony Brook to Millstone CONVEX\n\nWestbrook to Seabrook Maine, NH\n\nIn the event that the Primary Paths cannot be followed or if sufficient Resources are\navailable to support multiple Plan objectives concurrently, Alternate Paths are detailed in\nAttachments H and K.

Actions taken at LCC or Local Dispatch Centers to secure voltage, thermal\nor frequency conditions may include the switching of reactive devices, Resource\ndispatch actions, transmission switching or load shedding. As a guide, per the NERC\nRestoration Reference Document, shedding approximately six to ten percent (6-10%) of\nthe load in the island will restore frequency in that island by 1 Hertz[3].\n\nThe ISO System Operators may need to suspend use of Electronic Dispatch orders and\nchange to manual dispatch orders. Also, depending on the status of the tie-lines\nbetween RCAs or BAAs, ISO System Operators should appropriately select flat\nfrequency or tie-line bias control to stabilize frequency. If the New England power\nsystem is electrically isolated, the flat frequency control mode should be implemented. If\nstill synchronously tied to one or more BAAs, combinations of different control modes\nmay have to be explored. Tie-line bias control should be selected if ISO is the smaller of\nthe RCAs interconnected. If ISO is the larger of the synchronously connected RCAs, flat\nfrequency control should be selected.\n\nWhen flat frequency operation is used, the normal bias setting (approximately 1% of\nforecasted peak load) may be changed to a reduced value that approximates the\nexpected actual frequency response of the remaining island. This reduced bias setting\nshould minimize system frequency oscillations by preventing excessive Regulation\nchange signals to Resources during islanding. Slower moving Regulation Resources\nshould also be selected to prevent significant frequency excursions.\n\n**D. Avoiding Unplanned Connections of Electrical Islands**\n\nCircuit breakers of transmission circuits that opened during the blackout event, and\nwhose terminals are energized within separate electrical islands, may automatically\nreclose. This action can be performed by automatic synchronism-check relays that were\ninstalled to supervise the steady-state angles across, and appropriate re-closure of, an\nopen circuit whose terminals are synchronized during normal system conditions. The\nunintentional reclosing of two disconnected systems whose frequencies and voltages\nhappen to match for a sufficient period of time, may be followed either by the trip of the\ncircuit as the islands continue to pull away from each other or the de-energization of one\nor more of the recently connected islands. Also, there is a risk that circuits between\nelectrical islands may be inadvertently closed during switching for system restoration.\n\nTo avoid unplanned connections between electrical islands, switching procedures\nshould:\n\n3 NERC Operating Manual August 2016; Electric System Restoration Reference Document by the North American Electric Reliability Council\n\nApril 1993; updated July, 2003; VI.

Restoration of Off-Site ac Power to Nuclear Power Stations**\n\nOne of the most critical power requirements after a blackout is the assurance of reliable\nshutdown of nuclear Generators. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires\nthat these Generators have reliable on-site power sources (Emergency Generators) for\nshutdown operations. The expeditious restoration of alternative off-site ac power\nsources to nuclear power stations is imperative to promote the continued reliability of\nshutdown operations.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance during system assessment after a blackout to determine\nthe status of the Emergency Generators at nuclear power stations in New England. The\nISO Restoration Coordinator shall use this information to prioritize coordinated system\nrestoration activities.\n\nThe Plan documents the Primary and Alternate paths for restoring off-site ac power to\nnuclear power stations, stressing the urgency to restore off-site power to nuclear\nGenerators that have lost all off-site and on-site ac power. The agreements pertaining to\nhow the off-site power requirements of nuclear power stations are fulfilled during System\nRestoration, including priority of system restoration, are contained in Master/Local\nControl Center Procedure No.1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) and\nthe following M/LCC 1 Attachments:\n\nAttachment C - Millstone Nuclear Power Station (Confidential) (M/LCC 1C)\n\nAttachment D - Seabrook Nuclear Power Station (Confidential) (M/LCC 1D)\n\nThe loss of all off-site and on-site ac power at a nuclear power station is defined as a\nStation Blackout (SBO). Each nuclear Generator can maintain adequate core cooling\nwithout significant damage for the minimum SBO coping time listed in M/LCC 1 Attachment C and D for the applicable nuclear power station. ISO and each applicable\nLCC shall be mindful of the amount of time that the New England nuclear Generators\ncan maintain adequate core cooling during an SBO event and shall reassess system\nrestoration priorities to take into consideration the requirements and urgency of the\nnuclear power station that is experiencing an SBO event.\n\nNuclear power stations are notified when a stable power system is established following\na system restoration. This notification enables the nuclear power station to switch from\nthe emergency on-site power sources back to the New England transmission system for\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\ncontinued reliability of shutdown operations.\n\n**F. Opening Circuit Breakers and Switches**\n\nIn most cases, in-place substation procedures provide specific switching instructions to\nbe followed in the event of a substation blackout. Some substations have equipment\nwhich automatically switches into a desired post-blackout configuration.\n\nIn general, capacitors and customer loads will be opened and disconnected from the\n345/230/115 kV transmission system. Similarly, circuit breakers or switches on the\n345/230/115 kV transmission system will be opened. On the 345 and 230 kV, stepdown transformers will be opened on the high side to avoid the simultaneous\nenergization of a 345 or 230 kV circuit along with a step-down transformer. Step-down\ntransformers off the 115 kV system will be opened on either the high or low side.\n\nOperators should have station and distribution capacitors opened in locations where\ncustomer load can effectively absorb charging from transmission lines. This will help\nprevent high voltage conditions on the transmission system and excessive underexcitation on Generators. Along these lines, operators should anticipate the use of any\navailable reactors to help absorb charging and prevent high voltage.\n\n**G. Reviewing Load Tap Changer (LTC) Positions**\n\nDuring system collapse, LTCs on autotransformers could move toward/to extreme tap\npositions in an attempt to maintain sub-transmission or distribution voltage. Upon\ncollapse, the LTCs would remain in these positions and subsequent re-energization of\nthe autotransformers could result in excessively high or low voltages that could result in\nequipment or load damage. Consequently, LTC positions should be checked prior to\nenergization of autotransformers. If LTC positions are substantially off nominal, taps\nshould be moved to nominal positions before energizing autotransformers.\n\n**H. Generator Start Ups and MW Loadings**\n\nGenerator MW loadings will be primarily dictated by minimum MW loading requirements\nto ensure Generator stability and the need to provide station service power to\nGenerators without blackstart capability. ISO and LCC System Operators should\nbalance restoring generation and load to restore the transmission system and meet the\ngoals of the Plan with the added coordination and stability requirements of excessive online generation. As larger Generators are started, they will provide stronger sources of\nsynchronized inertia and minimize excursions of frequency and voltage.\n\nStronger sources will facilitate circuit energizations, the provision of spinning reserve,\nand load pickups (including larger block sizes of load pickups).\n\nISO and LCC System Operators should provide on-line Generators with their minimum\nloading requirements. System Operators should also restore as much of the next\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\ncranked Generator’s minimum loading as possible prior to starting the next cranked\nGenerator. This load should be transferred by adjusting Generator loadings in the\nsynchronized subsystem. This method of providing minimum load requirements to\nGenerators is preferable to performing load pickups after a Generator has been\nsynchronized and is not yet stable at its minimum loading.\n\nGenerator loadings should be minimized to prevent severe frequency excursions, or loss\nof the island, in the event of a Generator trip. Increasing island inertia is beneficial to\nstable operation. Energizing additional transmission elements, load, and generation will\nincrease the island size and generation MW reserve in the island. These actions improve\nthe likelihood an island will ride-through a frequency excursion caused by a system\ndisturbance.\n\nThe ISO Restoration Coordinator shall determine the point during system restoration at\nwhich ISO will resume normal generation dispatch control, based on the following\nconsiderations:\n\n   - number of LCCs interconnected\n\n   - amount of synchronized reserve\n\n   - amount of transmission and load restored\n\n   - status of telecommunication and operating tools\n\n**I. Wind Plants and Solar Plants**\n\nWind plants and solar plants have variable outputs that are a function of wind speed or\nirradiance, respectively. The variability of these outputs can be problematic during a\nsystem restoration, particularly when trying to stabilize or synchronize islands.\n\nThe following guidelines should be applied for both wind plants and solar plants during a\nsystem restoration:\n\n   - In electrical islands:\n```\n    o Disconnect wind plants and solar plants if their varying outputs cause\n\n```\nunacceptable voltage or frequency deviations.\n\n`o Disconnecting all wind plants and solar plants at once may cause the island` to\n\ncollapse if their output exceeds 5% of the island’s generation capacity\n```\n    o Disconnect wind plants and solar plants in banks. Compensate with other\n\n```\ngeneration or load shedding to maintain frequency.\n\n   - In blacked-out areas:\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n```\n    o Ensure wind plants and solar plants are disconnected and leave them out-of\n```\nservice until the latter stages of system restoration.\n\n**J. Spinning Reserves**\n\nDuring initial stages of system restoration, few Generators are on-line and System\nOperators may not be able to provide spinning reserves. As system restoration\nprogresses and more Generators are phased in, System Operators should establish and\nmaintain enough spinning reserve as soon as possible to cover loss of the Generator\ngenerating the most MW. Eventually, spinning reserves should be adequate to cover\nloss of the largest generating Generator and have additional reserve for continuing\nGenerator start-up demands.\n\n**K. Load Pickups**\n\n**_1. Load Block Sizes_**\n\nLoad restoration will require careful coordination to ensure that Generator governors\nare not overtaxed and do not overspeed or underspeed during load pickups.\n\n     - Until operational experience shows otherwise, loads based on normal\n\noperating values for time, date and season should be restored in block sizes\nthat do not exceed 5% of total synchronized generating capability.\n\n     - When any Generator is operating with the governor in isochronous (isolated,\n\nisland) mode in an island which also contains significant generation with the\ngovernors operating in droop (parallel, manual) mode:\n```\n       o Monitor the isochronous unit loading as new load is energized and as\n\n```\ncold load decreases to:\n\n            - Ensure no overload of the isochronous unit occurs before\n\ntransferring load to a droop unit with available capacity.\n\n            - Ensure cold load reduction does not threaten to trip the\n\nisochronous unit on reverse power.\n\nIn all cases, monitor system performance (voltage and frequency excursions) during\nload energization to assess whether smaller load block energization would be\nappropriate.\n\n**_2. Frequency Increase Prior to Load Pick up, Automatic Underfrequency Load_**\n\n**_Shedding (UFLS)_**\n\nLarge frequency excursions are to be expected during system restoration. This is\nmost likely during the initial stages of system restoration where island sizes are 500\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nMW or less and load restoration is close to 5% of synchronized capability. To\nminimize these excursions and prevent compounding them by the triggering of\nAutomatic Underfrequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and other subsequent cascading\nproblems, System Operators should employ the following methods:\n\n    - Increase frequency to at least 60.3 Hertz prior to load pickup; if frequency is\n\nexpected to drop to less than 59.9 Hertz, increase frequency to no greater\nthan 61.2 Hertz prior to load pickup\n\n    - Avoid the restoration of feeders with UFLS. (Initially avoiding UFLS is\n\npreferred, but may not be possible based on substation design).\n\n    - If UFLS feeders must be restored, restore the feeders set at the lowest\n\navailable frequency setpoint. NERC Reliability Standard PRC-006-NPCC\nAutomatic Underfrequency Load Shedding, Attachment C provides detailed\ninformation on UFLS parameters in the Eastern Interconnection.\n\nAs island sizes grow to several hundred MW and the ratio of load block sizes to\nsynchronized generation decreases, smaller increases in frequency prior to load\npickup may become appropriate. System Operators may restore the portion of load\nwith UFLS that operate lower than 59.1 Hertz, provided that UFLS enabled feeders\nare diverse and UFLS actuation would not initiate a frequency excursion of a\nmagnitude that would jeopardize system restoration action. These feeders may be\nrestored in quantities that could be used to provide reserve for generation\ncontingencies during system restoration.\n\nFinally, as island/system sizes reach thousand(s) of MW, load block sizes should\nbecome a small percent of synchronized generation and increasing/maintaining\nfrequency after, rather than prior, to load pickups should be sufficient. Full UFLS\ncapability should be considered and restored as appropriate. This will provide\nbackup protection for generation contingencies in these larger size islands/systems.\n\nDuring system restoration, System Operators should observe analog/instantaneous\nrecordings of frequency response to actual load pickups (if available) and tailor\nfrequency increases and load block sizes to prevent excessive frequency excursions.\n\n**_3. Cold Load Pickup_**\n\nDuring system restoration, System Operators will be restoring feeder loads that have\nbeen de-energized for unusually long periods of time (commonly referred to as \"cold\nload\"). Cold load refers to the loss of diversity between cycling loads on a feeder.\nUpon re-energization of the load, simultaneous full demands of all the various load\ncomponents can be encountered. Consequently, System Operators should\nanticipate cold load pickups that are 1.5 to 5 times greater than normal feeder loads.\nAlso, the longer the de-energization period, the longer it will take for the cold load\nmagnitude to decay to a more typical value. During system restoration, System\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nOperators will be required to modify load pickups depending upon the cold load\nobserved.\n\n**L. Salient Electrical Concerns During System Restoration**\n\nReliable frequency and voltage performance (both transient and steady state) and\nreliable circuit energizations are major concerns during system restoration, especially\nduring initial stages. The following general guidelines address these concerns.\n\n**_1. Transmission Line Charging_**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe charging values referenced below are typical charging values. A more complete\nand specific set of 345 kV transmission line nominal charging values is contained in\nAttachment C - Charging of 345 kV Circuits in New England. These values may be\nused when and if system restoration strategies are employed, using Attachment G –\nSystem Restoration Strategies\n\n**NOTE**\n\nCables will not be energized using Rules of Thumb. Cable energizations will be\nevaluated by support engineering prior to energization\n\nAnticipate the introduction of shunt MVAr charging from line energizations and ensure\nthat adequate reactive control exists prior to line energizations. The following are\ntypical charging values:\n\n**For overhead lines:**\n\n     - 0.88 MVAr/mile for 345 kV\n\n     - 0.28 MVAr/mile for 230 kV\n\n     - 0.07 MVAr/mile for 115 kV\n\nThese figures show charging to be a critical concern on the 345 kV, a significant factor on\nthe 230 kV but much less of a concern on the 115 kV. Charging on cables is much higher\nthan that of overhead lines. These cable charging values, combined with a greater\nlikelihood of switching surge difficulties and pressurization problems for fluid-filled pipetype cables, underscore the need to delay the energization of cables until later stages of\nsystem restoration. Cable energizations will be evaluated by support engineering prior to\nenergization. A list of shunt devices within New England that may be of benefit during\nsystem restoration are provided in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 12 Voltage and Reactive Control, Appendix B - Voltage & Reactive Schedules (OP-12B).\n\n**_2. Voltage Schedules at Generators_**\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nVoltage limits during system restoration are detailed in Attachment P, Restoration Voltage\nLimits. ISO and LCC System Operators should work to maintain voltage schedules below\nnormal levels during system restoration. This will help combat charging from lightly\nloaded transmission lines and consequential high voltage and excessive switching\nsurges. Lower voltage schedules will reduce transmission line MVAr charging (which is a\nfunction of voltage squared) and promote leading operation of Generators and thus the\nabsorption of transmission line MVAr charging. As island/system sizes increase and\nsignificant real power MW flows start to occur on transmission circuits, normal voltage\nschedules at generating stations may become preferable. In any case, decisions on\nvoltage schedules should be based on actual system voltage levels and Generator\nreactive loadings versus their leading reactive power limits. Generators are less stable\nwhile absorbing reactive power and GOPs are less familiar with operating in this\ncondition; therefore, other options for absorbing reactive power or reducing the amount of\nreactive power that has to be absorbed should be exercised to restore leading reactive\nreserve on Generators.\n\n**_3. Circuit Energizations_**\n\nPerform circuit energizations in a deliberate manner. Prior to and after energization,\ncheck:\n\n    - The status of all associated facilities,\n\n   - Synchronism, and\n\n   - Reactive conditions.\n\nSwitching surges caused by inrush current on lines and transformers should be\nconsidered for 345 kV. Excessive switching surges are not anticipated for\nenergizations on elements with voltages less than 345 kV.\n\nIn the early stages of system restoration, 345 kV line or 345/115 kV transformer\nenergizations should be performed with a source that has a total capability of 150 MVA\nor more (could be one or more synchronized Generators); the specifics on this\ndetermination are addressed in Attachment G – System Restoration Strategies. The\nnumber and type of facilities that could be energized reliably will depend on line length\nor transformer characteristics. Energizations of a 345 kV element that is performed\noutside of the studied Primary or Alternate Paths shall be evaluated by ISO and the\napplicable LCC(s) System Operators using Attachment G – System Restoration\nStrategies. As system restoration progresses and the total capability of synchronized\nsources builds up to several hundred MVA spread out over the system, the possibility of\nexcessive switching surges decreases substantially.\n\nThe simultaneous energization of a 345 kV transmission line and a 345 kV step-down\ntransformer should be avoided. In cases where this is not possible (no breaker\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nbetween the line and transformer), the energization of these circuits should be\nperformed with a strong nearby source or in later stages of system restoration when\nsources are strong.\n\nIn general, a reactor connected to the tertiaries of 345 kV step-down transformers\nshould be closed-in prior to energization of the transformers. This will help prevent\nexcessively high switching and steady state voltages. Prior to switching, System\nOperators should confirm that the reactor will be beneficial and sufficient reactive\nreserve is available to maintain voltages after energization. In cases where multiple\nreactors are available, System Operators should decide how many reactors can/should\nbe energized along with the 345 kV step-down transformer.\n\n**NOTE**\n\n**_The term Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) and its definition has been adopted by_**\n**_NPCC in place of the term Special Protection System (SPS). For existing_**\n**_documentation, the terms Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Special Protection_**\n**_System (SPS) may be used until such time as the terminology is changed by the_**\n**_Transmission Owner on equipment and schematics used in operations and in_**\n**_the field. However, a subset of SPSs were not recognized as RAS and instead_**\n**_became Automatic Control Schemes (ACS)_**\n\nRemedial Action Schemes (RAS) or Automatic Control Schemes (ACS) that were\narmed prior to a blackout event may remain armed following the event. System\nOperators should be aware of which RASs/ACSs should remain armed following an\nevent. If an RAS/ACS could cause an undesired outcome or action, it is recommended\nthe RAS/ACS be disarmed.\n\n**_4. Synchronizations_**\n\nGenerating stations are the preferred locations for synchronizing Generators, islands\nor systems together. These stations have synchronizing equipment which is needed\nfor regular Generator phasing. Also, station operators should be versed in\nsynchronizing techniques. In the Plan, some synchronizations are planned at\ntransmission stations.   For these cases, the necessary means to match frequency\n(including synchronizing equipment, operator knowledge and communication links to\npredefined generating stations) have been considered.\n\nAt the circuit breaker where electrical islands will be synchronized, the voltage\nmagnitude of the two systems must be matched as closely as possible. Rules of Thumb\nfor system restoration are contained in Attachment G – System Restoration Strategies.\nA rule of thumb would be to close the circuit breaker with not more than 3% voltage\ndifference between the two islands. The island with the dynamic voltage control device\nclosest to the synchronizing location should change the voltage. The frequency of the\ntwo systems must also be matched as closely as possible. The difference should be no\ngreater than 20º of relative phase angle rotation per second,  or a synchroscope\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: Rev 11 Revision Date: February 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 28, 2025|\n\n\nrotation of not more than one (1) full revolution in 18 seconds.   The smaller island\nfrequency should be controlled and run at a slightly higher frequency. Finally, the syncscope phase should be as close to the 12 o’clock position as possible and certainly\nwithin +/-3 minutes (or about +/- 20º) of vertical upon breaker closure.\n\n**M. Inter-Island Ties**\n\nThe synchronization/energization of inter-island ties should occur during fairly early\nstages of system restoration. This should minimize problems associated with needing to\nsynchronize many small islands or trying to match frequencies of two large islands. It\nwould also promote the most effective use of available Resources to restore the system\nin the least amount of time. Synchronization/energization of inter-island ties during\nsystem restoration shall always be performed in accordance with M/LCC 18 and:\n\n(1) only with the authorization of ISO; or\n\n(2) if communications with ISO fail, if prudent to total system restoration and\n\ncommunications between the affected parties exist\n\nAttachment D lists the Inter-LCC Ties operating at 115 kV and above. ISO and LCC\nSystem Operators should complete Attachment N – Interconnection/Synchronization\nChecklist for interconnection/synchronization criteria during a system restoration event.\n\n**N. Inter-RCA/BAA Ties**\n\nRestoration of the Eastern Interconnection is a priority objective of the Plan. The same\nreasons for early establishment of inter-LCC ties apply to synchronous inter-RCA/BAA\nties. However, the lack of direct control over switching operations in other RCA/BAAs\nand their overall status/reliability should be considered before establishing ties. ISO\nSystem Operators should complete Attachment N – Interconnection/Synchronization\nChecklist for interconnection/synchronization criteria during a system restoration event.\n\nReliable operation of most HVdc converters requires that strong ac systems exist. For\nthis reason, System Operators should not attempt to energize HVdc ties during early\nphases of system restoration unless it is known that their design will allow reliable\noperation with weak ac systems. Interconnection/synchronization of inter-RCA-BAA ties\nduring system restoration shall always be performed in accordance with M/LCC 18 and:\n\n(1) only with the authorization of ISO; or\n\n(2) if communications with ISO fail, if prudent to total system restoration and\n\ncommunications between the affected parties exist.\n\nAttachment E lists the Inter-RCA/BAA Ties and guidelines for when the HVdc ties can be\nreliably restored.

Reporting Requirements During System Restoration**\n\nThe ISO Restoration Coordinator shall establish communications with LCC restoration\ncoordinators and with the restoration coordinators of each adjacent RC power system to\nfacilitate a flow of information that will promote coordinated system restoration. The ISO\nRestoration Coordinator shall be the primary contact for disseminating information\nregarding system restoration to the restoration coordinators of neighboring RCs, and to\nthe LCC restoration coordinators.

References\n\nNone\n\n# 2. Purpose\n\n1. To verify Local Control Centers (LCCs) conduct an overall assessment of the reliability of\n\nthe Resource and transmission system in New England for the Summer Operating\nPeriod (June through September) and Winter Operating Period (December through\nMarch).\n\n2. To document that the necessary preparations are made to the Bulk Electric System\n\n(BES) to maintain reliability during seasonal periods of peak demand and high power\ntransfers.\n\n# 3. Introduction\n\n1. During the Summer Season, the BES is subject to the highest system load demand.\n\nLarge power transfers require increased reactive capabilities to verify required voltages\ncan be maintained. Temperature sensitive equipment such as cables and transformers\nmust have adequate cooling to be able to sustain loading at their ratings. Contingencies\non the system or planned outages can cause increased loading on remaining equipment\nwhich result in increased I[2]X losses that can severely impact reactive reserves and\ncause unacceptable voltages.\n\n2. During the Winter Season, severe weather can affect proper operation of equipment\n\nwhich could degrade system reliability. Temperature sensitive equipment, such as\ncircuit breakers, gas insulated switchgear and air blast circuit breakers are susceptible to\nleaks and forced outages during extreme cold conditions.\n\n3. Equipment forced outages will be minimized by performing Seasonal Preparations prior\n\nto the heavy system load demands experienced during summer extreme hot periods,\nand winter extreme cold periods.\n\n# 4. Responsibilities\n\n1. The ISO Manager, Control Room Operations shall verify the applicable Season\n\nPreparations are performed by the LCCs and documented in accordance with this\nprocedure.\n\n2.

If the element STE overloads/openings stop and the case solves without severe\n\nvoltage/reactive conditions (such as voltage at or below 328 kV on the 345 kV\nsystem or voltage at or below 207 or 104 kV, respectively, on the 230 / 115 kV\nsystems), Inter RCA/BAA impact is acceptable.\n\n       - Treat as an IROL if either of the following post-contingent conditions occur:\n```\n            o When voltage on two or more non-radial 345 kV stations is below\n\n```\n95% of nominal voltage (328 kV) or\n```\n            o When transmission stations serving 500 MW or more net load\n\n```\nhave post-contingent voltage at or below 95% of nominal voltage\non the 345 kV system, or less than 90% of nominal voltage on the\n230 or 115kV systems.\n\n       - In outage coordination, note the scope of voltages at or below the above\n\nnoted thresholds\n\nB. If the element STE overloads/openings continue to the point where an element in\n\nthe New York ISO RCA/BAA becomes overloaded at or above its LTE rating,\n\n[STE allowed for underground cable circuits (except NNC, Y49, Y50 901 and 903\ncircuits, which are cable circuits)] unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact is\nindicated.\n\nC. If the element STE overloads/openings continue to the point where the case will\n\n**not solve, demarcate the subarea in the New England Transmission System that**\nwould separate from the rest of the system. This should be based on the\ncascading overload pattern evidenced by the load flows. Then go back to the\noriginal case and calculate the net power flow into or out of the subarea that\nwould be separated. Unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact is possible if the\nsubarea is supplying ≥ 1,200 MW to the rest of the system or if it is absorbing ≥\n1,200 MW of power. If the subarea is supplying < 1,200 MW or absorbing < 1,200\nMW, the contingency would not have unacceptable Inter RCA/BAA impact.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRevision 4.4 Page 2 of 3\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology, Attachment C|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: Rev 4.4 Revision Date: September 11, 2024|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 11, 2025|\n\n\n## M/LCC 15 Attachment C Revision History\n\n**Document History (This Document was created from the retired OP-19 Appendix G)**\n\n**Rev.

Background\n\nThe purpose of this Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC) Procedure is to describe the\nreliability methodology developed and used by ISO New England (ISO) and Local Control\nCenters (LCCs) for operational planning and Real-Time operations of the New England\nTransmission System[1],in accordance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation\n(NERC) Reliability Standard FAC-010 System Operating Limits Methodology for the\nPlanning Horizon, FAC-011 System Operating Limits Methodology for the Operations\nHorizon and FAC-014 Establish and Communicate System Operating Limits. Prescribed\noperator actions are further detailed in ISO Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission\nOperations (OP-19) and in several ISO Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs), ISO\nSystem Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC)\nProcedures.\n\nNERC Reliability Standards and NPCC Directories and Criteria documents define specific\nrequirements applicable to the design, planning and operation of the New England\nTransmission System. The provisions in this document and in OP-19 are used to determine\nthe data and methodology used by ISO for the development of System Operating Limits\n(SOLs), and the subset of SOLs classified as Interconnection Reliability Operating Limits\n(IROLs) that are used for the operational planning and Real-Time operation of the New\nEngland Transmission System.\n\n## 3. Responsibilities\n\nISO is responsible for performing the Reliability Coordinator (RC), Transmission Operator\n(TOP), and the Balancing Authority (BA) functions for the New England Transmission\nSystem. LCCs are responsible for performing the TOP function for their local areas. ISO\nand the LCCs are responsible for identifying SOLs. ISO is responsible for identifying the\nsubset of SOLs that qualify as IROLs.\n\nISO and the LCCs are responsible for ensuring their respective network models use the\nsame facility ratings as recorded in the NX-9 Transmission Information database unless\ntemporary ratings have been implemented or the NX-9 data has been determined to be\nerroneous; in this case, the NX-9 data shall be updated as soon as possible.\n\nISO and the LCCs are responsible for ensuring that their respective network models use the\nsame generator technical characteristics as recorded in the NX-12 Generator Technical\nData in the Customer Asset Management System (CAMS) database.\n\nISO and the LCCs coordinate to monitor system loading and the status of applicable\nelements of the New England Transmission System that could result in SOL or IROL\nexceedances or that are, or could be, critical to SOLs and IROLs within the New England\n\n1 The New England Transmission System is defined in the ISO Tariff and includes the Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area\n\n(RCA/BAA), Bulk Electric System and bulk power system elements found within New England on the transmission network.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\nTransmission System. Such monitoring allows ISO and the LCCs to know the current status\nof all facilities whose failure, degradation or disconnection could result in an SOL or IROL\nexceedance.\n\nISO has clear decision-making authority, action plans, and agreements in place to\nimmediately take actions, or to direct LCCs and Market Participants (MPs) within the New\nEngland Transmission System to take actions, to preserve the integrity and reliability of the\nNew England Transmission System and the Interconnection. ISO and the LCCs operate the\nNew England Transmission System to protect against instability, uncontrolled separation, or\ncascading outages from single-element contingencies and specified multiple-element\ncontingencies. Information concerning these contingencies and how ISO respects the\ntransmission system limits associated with these contingencies in system operations is\ncontained within OP-19 and this Procedure.\n\nISO and the LCCs are jointly responsible for monitoring and mitigating SOLs and IROLs in\nReal-Time. In instances where there is a difference in derived limits, ISO requires that the\nLCCs, TOPs and MPs operate the New England Transmission System to the most\nconservative limit.\n\nIn operating the New England Transmission System, ISO makes every effort to have the\nNew England Transmission System remain connected to the Eastern Interconnection.\nHowever, if ISO determines that by remaining interconnected, ISO is in imminent danger of\nexceeding an IROL, ISO will take actions or direct actions to protect the New England\nTransmission System.\n\nThis Procedure requires ISO to discuss options to mitigate potential or actual IROL\nexceedance with other affected RCs and to take actions, as necessary, to act in the best\ninterests of the Interconnection at all times. ISO informs potentially affected LCCs and RCs\nof Real-Time or anticipated EMERGENCY System Conditions, discusses options, decides\nupon solutions to prevent or resolve the identified problem and takes actions to avoid, when\npossible, or mitigate the problem. ISO also requires that system protection is coordinated\namong operating entities. When ISO is notified of a relay or equipment degradation or\noutage that reduces system reliability, ISO takes corrective action, or directs the LCCs to\ntake corrective action, as soon as possible.\n\nIf in operating the New England Transmission System, ISO or an LCC enter an unknown\noperating state (i.e., any state for which valid operating limits have not been determined),\nthey will restore operations to respect limits within 30 minutes. Examples of unknown\noperating states, and remediation actions, include but are not limited to:\n\n  - When a defined interface has a voltage/stability limit for one or more elements out-of\nservice and then an additional line on the specified interface is removed from service,\nthe present voltage/stability limit is unknown.

Network Model and Inputs\n\n 4.1 Network Model\n\nThe ISO network model used in the Real-Time operations horizon is contained in the\nISO Energy Management System (EMS) and includes all Resources and transmission\nfacilities in the New England Transmission System and an equivalence model for other\n69 kV and radial 115 kV facilities within New England. In addition, ISO models all key\nResources and transmission above 230 kV as well as an equivalence model for the 115\nkV and 138 kV in both the neighboring RCAs of New Brunswick and New York. The\nQuebec transmission system is asynchronously interconnected to New England via\nHVDC and is therefore not explicitly modeled; instead, it is modeled as Resource or\nload.\n\nFor the operational planning horizon, transient stability, dynamic stability and voltage\nstability analysis, ISO uses an off-line network study model contained in the Siemens\nPower Technology International (PTI) Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E)\nto identify those contingencies that may be identified as an SOL or IROL. This off-line\nnetwork model originates from the NERC Multiregional Modeling Working Group\n(MMWG) series of network models. The level of modeling detail meets or exceeds the\nNERC MMWG modeling requirements and the requirements of NERC Modeling\nStandards.\n\nFor Real-Time and near Real-Time thermal and voltage analysis, the EMS network\nmodel Powerflow is used. This model includes the applicable approved transmission\noutages, Resource outages, load forecast, estimated external transaction schedules and\nResource schedule. ISO also uses the EMS applications including Study-time\nContingency Analysis (STCA), Real-Time Contingency Analysis (RTCA) and the\nInterface Limit Calculator (ILC) to model all identified contingencies. The ISO network\nmodel also includes the modeling and operation of approved Remedial Action Schemes\n(RASs) and Automatic Control Schemes (ACSs), where appropriate. The network model\ndata and inputs System Operators use to perform Real-Time Assessments (RTA) are\nidentified in Attachment L – Real-Time Assessment Data.\n\n## 4.2 Transmission Facility Ratings\n\nThe foundation of the process for calculating thermal- or voltage-based SOLs is the\nestablishment of a comprehensive model of the facilities comprising the New England\nTransmission System and adjacent AC systems. Transmission facility ratings are the\nfoundation for the calculation of thermal-or voltage-based SOLs.\n\nTransmission facility ratings are required to be supplied to ISO by the Transmission\nOwners (TOs) per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 16 - Transmission\nSystem Data (OP-16) using the NX-9 data form. ISO administers an NX9 certification\nprocess that requires TOs to annually certify that all transmission equipment identified in\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\nOP-16 is accurately represented on the appropriate NX-9 form. The NX-9 form contains\ndata on the transmission element (transformer, line, reactor, capacitor, etc.) and the\nlimiting component (relay, disconnect switch, etc.) as well as the Summer/Winter,\nNormal, Long-Time Emergency (LTE), Short-Time Emergency (STE) and Drastic Action\nLimit (DAL) ratings. The basis for the calculation of any SOL starts first with a\ncomprehensive model of the facilities comprising the New England Transmission System\nand adjacent AC systems.\n\nEither the TOs or LCCs provide voltage limits based upon facility ratings. The voltage\nlimits include: Normal Voltage Limit (NORMVL), Long-Time Emergency Voltage Limit\n(LTEVL), Short-Time Emergency Voltage Limit (STEVL) and Drastic Action Voltage Limit\n(DAVL). High and low voltage limits are provided for NORMVL: both high and low\nvoltage limits may not be declared for LTEVL, STEVL and DAVL. Voltage limits must be\nprovided for all voltage levels monitored by the LCC (such as 345, 230, 115 and 69 kV)\nso that all stations with voltage monitoring may be checked for adherence to the voltage\nlimits. The most limiting voltage limit will always be used where different voltage limits\nexist within a station or in adjacent stations. The voltage limits provided must exceed inservice BES under voltage relay settings.\n\n## 4.3 Generator Technical Characteristics\n\nThe technical characteristics for Resources defined as Generators per ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand\nResponse Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation\nResources (OP-14) are required to be supplied by the Designated Entity to ISO, using\nthe NX-12 data form. The NX-12 form contains data on the technical characteristics of\nthe Generator units (response rates, MW and MVAr operating limits, etc.) that will be\nused in the network model.\n\nThe Generator voltage schedules specified in ISO New England Operating Procedure\nNo. 12 Voltage and Reactive Control (OP-12), Appendix B - Voltage and Reactive\nSchedules used in system operations and studies, are developed to meet SOLs and\nIROLs per the criteria and limits, as well as limiting contingencies, defined in OP-19 and\nits Appendices, and this Procedure and its Attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\n## 5. Determining, Operating to and Communicating SOLs and IROLs\n\nThe SOL determination methodology requires that an SOL provides acceptable New\nEngland Transmission System performance, as described in OP-19. Consequently, the New\nEngland Transmission System is operated so that, in the pre-contingent state, it shall\ndemonstrate transient, dynamic and voltage stability; all facilities shall be within their facility\nlimits. The New England Transmission System shall continue to demonstrate transient,\ndynamic and voltage stability; all facilities shall be within their thermal, voltage and stability\nlimits in the post-contingency state. The New England Transmission System operators (ISO\nand each LCC) determine SOLs. In the ISO and LCC determination of an SOL, the New\nEngland Transmission System conditions shall reflect current or expected system conditions,\nchanges to system topology such as facility outages (including outages of protection\nsystems) and facility de-ratings. ISO will commit and dispatch Resources, if available, in\norder to meet N-1 contingency coverage for an SOL, and N-1-1 coverage for an IROL. For\nSOLs, the impacted LCC(s) shall have the responsibility to identify if there is a need for post\nN-1 and/or pre N-1-1 firm load shedding. The impacted LCC(s) shall have the responsibility\nto determine the appropriate action plan to mitigate the firm load-shedding needed. The\nmitigation may include commitment and dispatch of Resources, an enhanced limit or a postcontingent action plan.\n\nIn the NERC Reliability Standards for Interconnection Reliability Operations and\nCoordination (IRO) it is stated that, for any identified IROL that is exceeded, the RC in\nconjunction with the TOP and BA will return its transmission system within the IROL limit.\nThese actions shall be taken without delay, but no longer than 30 minutes. The criteria time\nlimit in New England shall be 30 minutes to mitigate all IROL exceedances.\n\nAn SOL will normally be cleared within a two-hour period from the time of identification in\ncontingency analysis or ILC. For an SOL, ISO and any impacted LCC will prepare and\nimplement mitigation measures within the applicable time period after identification. These\nmeasures may include, but are not limited to, dispatch of Resources, facility switching and/or\nthe application of enhanced thermal or voltage limits.\n\nAn SOL experienced in Real-Time needs immediate resolution; the applicable time Tv\ndepends on the applicable limit, thermal or voltage, and may be shorter than two hours.\nVoltage SOLs have time limits, determined by the applicable LCC, as stated in MLCC 15\nAttachment H and OP-19 Appendix K - Operating Voltage Limits by LCC.\n\nThe following SOL exceedances will be communicated between ISO and the impacted\nLCCs:\n\n   - IROL exceedances\n\n    - SOL exceedances of stability limits\n\n   - Post-contingency SOL exceedances that have that have been confirmed to potentially\n\nbecome an IROL\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\n\n - Pre-contingency SOL exceedances of Facility Ratings\n\n - Pre-contingency SOL exceedances of normal minimum System Voltage Limits\n\nThe following SOL exceedances must be communicated between ISO and the impacted\nLCCs if they persist for more than 30 minutes:\n\n - Post-contingency SOL exceedances of Facility Ratings or emergency System Voltage\n\nLimits\n\n - Post-contingency SOL exceedances of normal maximum System Voltage Limits\n\nThese communications will use the processes described in MLCC 13 – ISO and LCC\nCommunication Practices.\n\nWhen determining the start time of an IROL or SOL exceedance, ISO and any impacted LCC\nwill use the contingency analysis that first identified the IROL/SOL exceedance. In\nresponding to an SOL, ISO and any impacted LCC will implement all applicable precontingency NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions, (as defined in OP-19). Pre-contingency\nload-shedding may be avoided if the TO or TOP (i.e., LCC) authorizes an enhanced facility\nthermal or voltage limit and the LCC has developed an implementable post-contingency\naction plan to operate the facility within enhanced limits. When the local area involves two or\nmore TOs, the appropriate LCC will coordinate the actions required by the TOs in response\nto the local area contingency. When the impacted TO(s) / LCC(s) cannot agree on a postcontingency action plan, all applicable pre-contingency NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions\nwill be used to resolve the SOL. This provision shall not be used for IROLs.\n\nAll agreements to operate to the enhanced facility limit and the use of post-contingent action\nplans shall be communicated to ISO electronically, prior to implementation. Use of a\nrecorded line is acceptable for these purposes. Written documentation of the agreements\nand post-contingent action plans shall be provided electronically (e.g., facsimile, email, etc.)\nto ISO in a timely manner, not to exceed 24 hours from the time the enhanced rating or\nlimit/post-contingent action plan was first provided.\n\nAny operation beyond an SOL for the applicable time period would not only constitute an\nexceedance, but may rise to the level of a violation. An example of this would be operation\nin Real-Time beyond an SOL (i.e., operation above the DAL rating). The violation\ndetermination and, if confirmed, root cause investigation, would be made following a\ntechnical review of the facts. For potential low voltage and IROL violations, such\ndeterminations are made by the ISO Operations Support Services department engineering\nstaff in cooperation with the appropriate LCC staff. The LCC staff, with the appropriate TOs,\nwould lead the determinations for potential high voltage violations.\n\n## 5.1 Thermal SOLs\n\nISO performs studies in order to establish seasonal and operational planning\ntransmission interface limits to prevent thermal overloads or cascading thermal\noverloads. ISO establishes these limits by evaluating system response to all the\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\ncontingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J - Contingency List and Criteria/Limits. Most\nof the contingencies are observed at all times and are used to determine SOLs; a subset\nof multi-element contingencies is only observed where the contingency could cause an\nIROL or cause unit instability. These studies therefore include:\n\na) the anticipated system conditions,\n\nb) a range of Resource availability and transmission outage scenarios,\n\nc) various peak load assumptions and\n\nd) simulation of defined protection schemes (RAS/ACS) actions where appropriate.\n\nThe limits are developed such that no facility limits are exceeded under a base-case set\nof assumptions. Then, ISO evaluates system performance assuming first contingency\n(N-1) to evaluate whether post-contingency loadings result in an SOL. Additionally, for\nIROLs, ISO evaluates the system in Real-Time to determine if adequate Resources and\noperational actions are available to reposition the system within 30 minutes to a new\noperating state that allows continued reliable operation in the event that a second\ncontingency (N-1-1) occurs. This type of analysis confirms the system can both:\n\na) withstand a first contingency and\n\nb) be repositioned to withstand the second contingency within the appropriate time\n\nperiod (30 minutes or 120 minutes), without resulting in an IROL / SOL.\n\nTransfer limits developed for system operation use the same methodology. For transfer\nlimits developed for N-1-1 interfaces, opening the limiting transmission element can be\nutilized if:\n\n  - the facility operates at 115kV or below\n\n  - the limitation is thermally-based\n\n  - the facility would be opened post first contingency\n\n  - the ISO Control Room consulted with Real-Time Studies to determine if there\n\nwere adverse voltage or stability consequences from opening the facility\n\n  - the impacted LCC was consulted and approved the post-contingent opening of\n\nthe facility\n\nFor reliable operation with N-1 considerations, the same evaluation process can be used\nto open a breaker for limiting stuck breaker contingencies if:\n\n  - the limitation is thermally based\n\n  - the ISO Control Room consulted with Real-Time Studies to determine if there\n\nwere adverse voltage or stability consequences from opening the facility\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\n\n    - the impacted LCC was consulted and approved the pre-contingent opening of the\n\nfacility\n\nEnhanced facility limits will be considered by ISO if provided by the TO or TOP (i.e.,\nLCC) when a facility limit has been identified as the basis for an SOL, even in Real-Time.\nAs noted in OP-19, the TO may provide enhanced facility limits to ISO and the LCC that\nreflect the impact of current ambient conditions, or other appropriate limit assumption\nchanges, that may allow for an enhanced facility limit for a transmission facility. All\nenhanced facility limits provided shall be communicated to ISO electronically or over a\nrecorded phone line prior to implementation; documentation of the enhanced facility\nlimits in writing (e.g., facsimile, email, etc.) shall be provided electronically to ISO in a\ntimely manner not to exceed 24 hours. Enhanced facility limits are expected to include\ntwo aspects - the facility limit and the allowed time duration for its use. For example, an\nenhanced thermal limit for a facility may be a two-minute limit to allow post-contingent\nactions to be applied within two minutes to return the facility to its normally utilized facility\nlimit set (Normal, LTE, STE, and DAL). The main difference between enhanced limits\nand limits resulting from weather-sensitive ratings is that enhanced limits can exist for\ntime periods shorter than those defined in our set of supported ratings (Normal, LTE,\nSTE and DAL).\n\n## 5.2 Voltage and Reactive SOLs\n\nISO performs studies to establish transmission interface limits to prevent cascading\nvoltage collapse by testing all contingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J. Most of the\ncontingencies are observed at all times and are used to determine SOLs; a subset of\nmulti-element contingencies is only observed where the contingency could cause an\nIROL. Where appropriate, simulations of defined protection scheme (RAS/ACS) actions\nare included in the studies.\n\nThese analyses are conducted prior to Real-Time operations and use a set of stressed\nsystem conditions, such as:\n\na) a range of high-load levels to aggravate low voltage problems;\n\nb) a range of low-load levels to aggravate high voltage problems;\n\nc) a range of Resource availability to quantify the impact on the voltage problem;\n\nand\n\nd) inclusion of Resource and transmission maintenance conditions\n\nThese analyses are conducted using standard load-flow techniques. The analyses\nidentify limits by either detecting an exceedance of acceptable minimum/maximum\nvoltage limits on transmission buses or detecting the failure of simulations to converge an event which signals a voltage collapse. Once a maximum transfer limit is determined\nby a convergent solution containing acceptable voltage profiles, ISO will then reduce the\ntransmission interface limit by an engineering safety margin. The magnitude of the\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\nmargin is based on reviewing the P-V system response and maintaining sufficient\ngradients between the pre-contingency voltages and the limiting post-contingency\nvoltages. Typically these engineering safety margins are approximately 50 MW to\n100 MW. Utilizing the study assumptions of a stressed system and operating at this\nreduced transfer limit provides a safety margin to protect against widespread voltage\ninstability or collapse and prevent an IROL.\n\nSOL identification will utilize the voltage limits supplied. A voltage SOL exceedance will\noccur when:\n\n     - A transmission substation has a voltage beyond the applicable voltage limit\n```\n      o Exception 1: Radial transmission stations, either by design or the result of a\n\n```\ncontingency, with voltages below the low voltage limits will not be considered\nSOLs. This exception may also be applicable, following LCC review, for\nvoltages beyond the high voltage limits, for the duration defined by the\naffected LCC(s),\n```\n      o Exception 2: Any high voltage exceedance that can be mitigated in less than\n\n```\nfive minutes at 107% or less of nominal voltage (where the high limit is 105%\nof nominal), will not be considered a high voltage SOL exceedance.[2]\n\n            - This would only apply to Real-Time conditions or Real-Time\n\nContingency Analysis. The voltage limits in M/LCC15 Attachment H\n– Voltage SOL Identification Procedure (M/LCC15H), shall be used\nin next-day planning, which includes mitigating actions (including\nunit commitment) when exceedance of a high voltage limit of 105%\nof nominal is indicated.\n\n     - The system performance assessment determines that a voltage collapse is likely\n\nto occur. Indications of voltage collapse include:\n```\n       o a non-converged power flow solution\n\n```\n2 The following factors justify this determination:\n\n - The transmission system has been planned by transmission owners allowing load-tap-changing transformers and switched capacitors / reactors to move\n\npost-contingency before application of voltage limits. Prior to movement of these devices, modest over-voltage conditions can be present for those short\nperiods of time. Therefore, since the system has been designed and control / protection settings applied to allow these actions, the immediate postcontingency over-voltage conditions are acceptable.\n\n - Transmission capacitors banks in New England have automatic switch out voltage setpoints over 105% of nominal (most set at 107% of nominal) with\n\ntime delays varying between many seconds up to 10 minutes. These time delays have been used for years, and operation of the equipment at those\nvoltage levels, for those short time periods, is acceptable.\n\n - Voltage unbalance exists in all three phase power systems, and the New England system is no exception. The level of unbalance is often on the order of\n\n1 to 2%. That means when any station voltage, monitored on a single phase basis, indicates 105% of nominal, the other phase voltages could be as high\nas 107%. There is no preclusion from operating at 105% of nominal for extended periods of time, which means there is no preclusion for extended\nperiods of operation of other phases as high as 107% of nominal.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n```\n      o a voltage below the defined voltage-collapse threshold documented in\n\n```\nM/LCC15H\n```\n      o rapidly dropping voltage based upon modest changes in system load or\n\n```\ntransfer, based upon system conditions, at voltage levels above the voltage\nlimits provided by the TO\n\nThe potential for an IROL is determined through use of standard load-flow techniques for\nthe area in question. In the determination analysis, the area is examined beyond the\ntransfer limit to determine the subarea that may be lost due to voltage collapse. The\nanalysis methods used to determine this subarea may include Q/V analysis using\nreactive power injection sources or manipulation of the limiting facility’s impedance to\nachieve a last solution before insolubility. The IROL list from OP-19 Section II.A.1.b\nwould be used to determine the existence of a potential IROL based upon this analysis.\n\nSOL determination for voltage operating limits requires LCC identification of the SOL or\nISO identification of the potential SOL and subsequent LCC concurrence of the SOL\nexistence. Use of this method allows the more detailed local system modeling of the\nLCCs to be consulted before SOL confirmation by the LCC and ISO. Either the LCC or\nISO can identify a voltage collapse SOL.\n\nIf a TO or LCC provides an enhanced limit to resolve a voltage SOL to preclude precontingent load shedding, they must provide the loads to be shed post-contingent to\nresolve the SOL.\n\nTransmission System voltage schedules have been established for the New England\nTransmission System to operate within SOLs and IROLs for expected system conditions.\nFor transmission stations with generators, dynamic reactive resources, and load tapchanging transformers, these voltage schedules are documented in OP-12, Appendix B.\nThe resulting pre-contingency transmission operating voltage range is normally between\n100% and 105% of nominal for all transmission voltage classes (115, 230 and 345 kV).\nThe voltage schedules and resulting transmission operating range support the meeting\nof system voltage SOLs and IROLs based upon the voltage limits and criteria listed in\nOP-19 and its Appendices, and this Procedure and its Attachments.\n\n## 5.3 Transient and Dynamic Stability SOLs\n\nISO performs studies to establish transmission interface limits to prevent unit/area\ninstability, insufficiently damped system response, or unacceptable transient low voltage\nconditions. The ISO uses the following criteria and guidelines when performing stability\nstudies:\n\n       - Steady state voltage stability : The ISO applies the voltage limits listed in OP\n\n19 Appendix K and engineering judgement when examining voltage\nperformance in stability analysis results\n\n      - Transient voltage response: As listed in ISO NE’s Transmission Planning\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\nTechnical Guide – Appendix B\n\n     - Angular stability: Resource stability required for all tested normal criteria\n\nfaults. No more than 20 MW of generation shall trip and remain off-line\nfollowing a fault / fault clearance / system disturbance, at transmission or\nlower system voltages\n\n    - System damping: As listed in ISO NE’s Transmission Planning Technical\n\nGuide – Appendix C\n\nTo do these studies, ISO conducts testing under a range of system conditions, including\ntesting the system at light load conditions due to the reduced system damping available\nfrom load and inertia from limited online Resources. The system model tested includes\nall of New England, and significant detail in the adjacent RC areas, at a minimum.\nSignificant sensitivities to Resource dispatch, reactive equipment availability,\nbus/breaker configurations, line/breaker-out conditions, defined protection scheme\n(RAS/ACS) action/in-action, etc., are all considered in the testing. RAS response may\nbe modeled and considered for potential IROLs and SOLs, while limited RAS will only be\nconsidered for SOL outcomes and not IROLs. Under-frequency load shedding will not be\nrelied upon at all when establishing stability limits.\n\nThe transmission interface limits are determined using standard transient stability\nsimulations of the contingencies defined in OP-19, Appendix J and are limited by\nunit/area instability, insufficiently-damped system response, or unacceptable transient\nlow voltage conditions. The list of contingencies in OP-19, Appendix J will be evaluated\nfor revision based upon available feedback, including that from ISO NE planning on\nappropriate contingencies to consider for stability analysis.\n\nOnce the transfer limit is determined with acceptable dynamic performance through the\nanalysis, ISO will reduce the transmission interface limit by an engineering safety margin\nof approximately 50 MW to 100 MW. At this limit, damping is evaluated to determine if\nthe dampening criterion is met. If so, no additional buffer is included; if not, transfers\nare continually reduced and re-evaluated until the dampening criterion is met. As this is\nthe case with voltage or reactive limit exceedances, it is necessary to operate at this\nreduced transfer limit to protect against unit/area instability, insufficiently damped system\nresponse, an unacceptable transient low voltage condition, and to prevent an SOL/IROL\nexceedance.\n\nThe results of the analysis, and the potential consequences for not adhering to the\nstability limit, are examined against the IROL list in OP-19 Section II.A.1.b. Machine\ninstability for one or more units may be included as a potential IROL based upon the fact\nthat unit instability may lead to other system concerns such as:\n\n  - Uncontrolled loss of transmission elements adjacent to, or remote from, the\n\nResource in question:\n```\n   o The uncontrolled loss of transmission elements is an example of an “inability\n\n```\nto determine if a discrete sub-area of the system is susceptible to voltage\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\ncollapse or uncontrolled separation from the rest of the system” (an IROL\nexample from OP-19)\n```\n     o This may lead to multiple 345 kV elements (lines, transformers and\n\n```\nsubstations) being lost due to unit instability of a 345 kV-connected generator.\n\nFinally, ISO evaluates system operations in response to the extreme contingency threephase fault with delayed clearing in order to:\n\na) measure system strength;\n\nb) determine the extent of a widespread system disturbance; and\n\nc) impose an additional reduction in the transmission interface limit depending on\n\nthe system impact.\n\nThe results of these studies are shared with impacted LCCs and adjacent RCs, as\nappropriate, with feedback and comments sought before finalizing the analysis and\nlimits.\n\n## 5.4 Transmission Interfaces and ILC\n\nISO determines N-1-1 transmission interface limits for importing areas identified as\nhaving the potential to be an IROL within the New England RCA. This is performed so\nthat adequate post “first contingency” actions to redispatch the New England\nTransmission System within 30 minutes of the “first contingency” (N-1) are available and\nthe ISO is prepared for the next contingency. ISO communicates these limits to all\nLCCs. ISO continually refines and updates study assumptions for identifying\ntransmission interface limits up to and including Real-Time.\n\nIn Real-Time, ISO and LCC software (such as the ISO ILC) is configured to alert the ISO\nand LCC System Operators when potential exists for exceeding an SOL or IROL\nassociated with an interface due to Real-Time system conditions. The ISO ILC\ninterfaces are listed in Attachment J of this procedure. System Operators will preposition Resources (e.g., generation) or take other pre-contingent NORMAL actions\nwhen system flows indicate that an IROL exceedance may occur if a contingency were\nto take place or, in the case of N-1-1 interface limits, if there would be inadequate\nactions available to redispatch the system within 30 minutes in preparation for the next\ncontingency. In addition, ISO and LCC contingency analysis (CA) applications will\nidentify specific stuck-breaker, bus-fault and double-circuit tower contingencies to\nevaluate whether they would result in a potential IROL. These specific contingencies are\nidentified in the Attachments of this Procedure; please refer to Section 6 for a description\nof the Attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\n## 5.5 Single Source Contingencies\n\nJoint RC studies have concluded that the loss of a supply source at high levels of\nimports (greater than 1,200 MW) could have a larger effect on NYISO and PJM than the\nworst internal contingency that these individual systems normally protect against. ISO\nmonitors and will dispatch its large Single Source Contingencies against the PJM and\nNYISO limiting interfaces such that the New England system does not impose an IROL\non another area in Real-Time.\n\n## 5.6 Real-Time Transmission Protection and Relay Outages\n\nTransmission Owners shall notify the ISO control room of Real-Time transmission\nprotection and relay outages as described in ISO New England Operating Procedure No.\n24 - Protection Outages, Settings and Coordination (OP-24) and Master Local Control\nProcedure No. 7 Attachment D – Minimum Advance Notice Times – Outage Requests\nfor Specific Equipment (M/LCC 7D).\n\nWithin the New England transmission system, the 345 kV transmission network serves\nas the bulk transmission paths for power transfer through the system. Outages that\nimpact this system, and its ability to transfer power, have the greatest likelihood to\nimpact reliability in New England\n\nAll 345 kV transmission lines in the New England Transmission System should have two\nrelay schemes that will clear a fault anywhere on the line with no intentional time delay\n\n[nominally around four (4) cycles]. In general, if both high-speed protection systems are\nout-of-service, a fault on the affected line would be cleared by backup relay protection or\nintentionally time-delayed protection systems which usually take longer to clear faults,\npossibly leading to instability, cascading outages, and system separation. It is possible\nthat the loss of both high-speed relay protection schemes can dynamically impose SOLs\nor IROLs depending on the location of affected equipment and facilities. If a high-speed\nsystem is out-of-service and the remaining high-speed system fails, a fault somewhere\non the line will likely not be cleared high-speed. If a 345 kV line is in-service and\nenergized while both high-speed relay schemes are out-of-service, and instruction or\nguidance is not available for this condition, one of the following actions must be taken\nwithin 30 minutes:\n\n    - Return to service one of the two high-speed protection systems\n\n    - De-energize the affected 345 kV line\n\nDe-energizing the affected 345 kV line will be the normal response to these outages.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology Revision Number: Rev 15 Revision Date March 28, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 28, 2025|\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe following high-speed pilot schemes are used in New England to protect the 345 kV\nlines.\n\nBlocking schemes (e.g., Directional Comparison with Blocking Scheme - DCB) work on\nthe principle of the signal exchanged among all terminals during normal, no-fault or a fault\noutside the protected zone condition. As long as the signal is received, the terminal will\n**not clear a fault even though it is detected locally. The blocking signal will stop once a**\nfault is detected within the protected zone, thus allowing the terminals to trip and clear the\nfault.\n\nThe following schemes are prone to over-tripping on faults beyond the protected zone\nonce the communication fails.\n\nPermissive schemes (e.g., Permissive Overreaching Transfer Trip - POTT; Directional\nComparison Underreaching Transfer Trip - DUTT) in addition to the local relay detecting\nthe fault require a signal (permission) from the remote terminal to trip. Without this signal,\nthe terminals will not trip; therefore a communication failure results in unreliable\nprotection of a line.\n\nCurrent Differential Scheme (Current D): Relay inputs are provided from each side of a\ntransmission line.

Voltage SOL Identification Procedure\n\n This Procedure presents the general philosophy/method for identifying and resolving steady-state voltage limit exceedances and determining if a voltage limit exceedance is a System Operating Limit (SOL). All first contingency (N-1) voltage limit exceedances, as indicated in Contingency Analysis (CA), should be treated as potential voltage SOL exceedances. When Real-Time voltage is greater than the highest voltage limit, the condition will be considered an SOL violation. When Real-Time voltage is below the lowest voltage limit, the condition will be considered either an SOL or Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit (IROL) exceedance or violation, based on the assessment in the following step 3.B.\n\n This function is executed while monitoring system voltage performance. Use Figure 1 below for the summary of actions to be taken. Each action is described in detail after Figure 1.\n\n Figure 1\n\n\n#### Action Summary for Voltage Exceedance/Violation Identification/Resolution\n\n\n#### 1. Identify voltage limit exceedance/violation\n\n 2. Operator confirmation of steady-state voltage limit exceedance/violation\n\n 3. Confirm a voltage limit exceedance/violation with applicable Transmission Operators\n (TOPs), if needed\n\n 4. Resolve the voltage limit exceedance/violation\n\n 5. If voltage limit exceedance cannot be resolved, the applicable Local Control Center\n (LCC)/Transmission Owner (TO) accepts the exceedance and develops an action plan\n\n 1. Identify the voltage limit exceedance \n\n A. ISO New England (ISO) or an LCC can identify the exceedance. \n\n B. The exceedance can either be pre- or post-contingent identified either through\n supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) alarms or CA.\n\n 2. Operator confirmation of the steady-state voltage limit exceedance\n\n A. Confirmation may include:\n\n (1) Separate analysis with off-line tools and/or validation of key SCADA data (i.e.\n voltage readings, unit / automatic voltage regulator (AVR) / capacitor / reactor status). \n\n a. Any voltage exceedance persisting for two minutes or less is not a steady-state\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology, Attachment H Revision Number: 10 Revision Date: February 6, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 6, 2025|\n\n\n#### voltage exceedance and warrants no further review\n\n (2) In Real-Time, determine accuracy of the voltage indication at the station. Factors to\n consider are: \n\n a. M/LCC15 Attachment I - Primary and Secondary Voltage Inter-Control Center\n Communications Protocol (ICCP) IDs (MLCC15I), if the station is listed\n\n b. Voltage readings for other meters at the station\n\n c. Voltage estimated at the station from the State Estimator (SE) solution\n\n d. Voltage at nearby stations\n\n 3. Confirm the voltage limit exceedance with other appropriate TOPs (if needed) \n\n A. If unable to confirm between operators, then the voltage results provided by the more\n accurate / complete system model local to the exceedance can be accepted if both operators agree. If the operators are unable to agree or both operators identify a voltage limit exceedance, use the more conservative result. \n\n B. If the voltage limit exceedance is confirmed, the ISO and LCC operators must\n discuss and agree on the following: \n\n (1) The start time of the voltage limit exceedance\n\n (2) Make an initial SOL / IROL determination to apply the appropriate timer (120 or 30\n minutes) for the voltage limit exceedance\n\n a. A high voltage limit exceedance is an SOL\n\n b. A low voltage limit exceedance is: \n\n  Treated as an IROL, when voltage on two or more non-radial 345 kV stations\n is below 95% of nominal voltage (328 kV); or\n\n  Treated as an IROL when transmission stations serving 500 MW or more net\n load have post-contingent voltage at or below 95% of nominal voltage on the 345 kV system, or less than 90% of nominal voltage on the 230 or 115kV systems; or\n\n  Treated as an SOL for any other low voltage limit exceedance \n\n (3) Determine what pre- and post-contingent actions are needed to resolve this\n exceedance\n\n (4) Determine if any enhanced voltage limits are needed to allow the use of post contingent actions (for SOLs only) \n\n (5) Contact the ISO on-call engineer to obtain confirmation or correction to any low\n voltage IROL identification\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology, Attachment H Revision Number: 10 Revision Date: February 6, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 6, 2025|\n\n\n#### 4. Resolve the voltage limit exceedance \n\n A. If pre-contingent NORMAL and EMERGENCY actions resolve the exceedance, the\n operators will agree upon a course of action and implementation that is effective within the appropriate time period. If post-contingent actions are required, an enhanced voltage limit may be needed to allow use of the post-contingent actions.  The pre- and post-contingent actions taken to resolve the voltage limit exceedance are the action plan. \n\n B. Any high voltage exceedance that can be mitigated in less than five minutes at 107%\n or less of nominal voltage (where the high limit is 105% of nominal), will not be considered a high voltage SOL exceedance.\n\n C. Radial Low Voltage: Radial transmission stations or stations that become radial due\n to contingencies with voltages below the low voltage limits will not be considered SOLs. \n\n D. Radial High Voltage: A radial exception may also be applicable for voltages above\n the high voltage limit for:\n\n (1) Radials involving TO only elements. The LCC for that TO only radial can provide\n the exception. If the high voltage condition exceeds 115% of nominal, the exception must specify both the new high limit and the allowed time duration. This radial high voltage exception is to be used for Real-Time conditions or Real-Time CA (RTCA) only, and cannot be applied to operations planning study results. The only voltage criteria exceptions that can be applied to operations planning studies are those which are:\n\n  documented in MLCC15 Attachment E Transmission System Voltage\n Criteria Exceptions (MLCC15E) or\n\n  documented in the ISO Temporary Guide (TG) “Voltage Criteria Exceptions\n Temporary” or\n\n  topology driven and receive TO approval as documented in the CROW\n applications. For example, based on expected system conditions, a contingency shows high voltage on the open ended side of a transformer.  However, the other side of the transformer is not experiencing high voltage and the TO either agrees that the open ended node high voltage is acceptable, or that the other end of the transformer can be opened.\n\n (2) Radials involving TO and non-TO owned elements, such as a generator step-up\n transformer (GSU). To be accepted, the exception must be identified and documented in either the ISO Temporary Guide (TG) “Voltage Criteria Exceptions Temporary” or MLCC15E, where the non-TO Asset owner concurrence is documented. “Voltage Criteria Exceptions Temporary” will note the facilities excepted, the new high limit for the subject facilities, and the allowed time duration.

If the voltage limit exceedance cannot be resolved with NORMAL actions, perform the\n following:\n\n A. If confirmed as an SOL, the LCC must report the voltage exceedance to ISO. \n\n B. For any low voltage limit exceedance meeting the following criteria, ISO Control\n Room staff shall perform the following actions: \n\n (1) Contact the ISO on-call engineer if there is a concern for voltage collapse \n\n a. The on-call engineer or Control Room System Operator can determine the\n potential for voltage collapse using the following guidelines\n\n (i) Voltages at or below 85% of nominal indicate potential voltage collapse and\n will be treated as though voltage collapse at each station experiencing voltage of 85% of nominal or less will occur. This means all transmission lines connected to the station should be expected to open once voltage drops to this level\n\n (ii) Determine if voltage collapse is possible given current operating conditions\n and the limiting contingency (or contingencies) for voltages above 85% of nominal.\n\n (iii) Apply the following guidelines for voltage collapse evaluation:\n\n (a) Voltages between 90% and 95% of nominal are acceptable and are not\n likely to lead to voltage collapse. \n\n (b) Voltages between 85% and 90% of nominal indicate some potential for\n voltage collapse. The engineer accounts for system weakness which may make the area susceptible to voltage collapse at voltages within this band. If there is any question, err on the side of conservatism and assume voltage collapse will occur.\n\n (2) ISO informs the LCC of the potential for voltage collapse and will identify if it is a\n voltage SOL or IROL exceedance.\n\n 6. Any Real-Time operation beyond an SOL, which occurs when operating in any\n prohibited state (e.g., Drastic Action Voltage Limit-High (DAVL-H), Drastic Action Voltage Limit-Low (DAVL-L)), in any of the voltage tables below, constitutes an SOL exceedance and will be considered an SOL violation until completion of the root cause investigation.  A technical review of the facts will be conducted prior to the determination that an SOL exceedance or violation has occurred and a root cause analysis is needed. For potential SOL low voltage and IROL violations, such determinations are made by ISO engineering staff in Operations Support Services in cooperation with the appropriate LCC staff. LCC staff, with the appropriate TOs, would lead the determinations for potential SOL high voltage violations.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology, Attachment H Revision Number: 10 Revision Date: February 6, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 6, 2025|\n\n\n#### II. Table Use Example\n\n The proper use of the tables in this document is important for identifying SOLs in Real-Time.  Consequently, an example explaining use of the tables is included below.\n\n The following definitions apply globally in the Tables: \n\n  “Condition” is a single word label used in the first column of each Table which contains\n the system voltage condition under examination.\n\n  “Acceptable” and green color denote an acceptable system voltage condition for which\n the operator does not need to take immediate action to change or alter. Any of the emergency voltage conditions, on the other hand, do require operator action to return the system voltage condition to “Acceptable”.\n\n  An “Action Plan” may include both pre- and post-contingency actions. The “Action\n Plan” does not need to include any pre-contingency actions. The actions included must be able to be performed in the allowed time period for the voltage limit in question.\n\n  The second column label in each Table uses the single word “Voltage” to describe the\n voltage assessment condition to determine which system voltage condition is the correct choice for the specific voltages (Real-Time and contingency) under examination. The voltage assessment conditions are set-up so that for any given voltage, only one system voltage condition can be true.\n\n  Table Notes that apply globally to the Table are assigned to the Table title. This\n means that the notes are applicable to all conditions captured in the Table, i.e., each row. In other words, these notes are applicable during all potential operating conditions.\n\n In this example, Table 1 will be used. This table is for 115 kV facilities operated by CONVEX and owned by Eversource. The example will focus on the SOL table. For the purposes of this example, the following voltage information is true:\n\n  A non-radial Eversource 115 kV station has a voltage of 116 kV in Real-Time\n\n  CA shows the same Eversource 115 kV station has identified a potential low voltage\n condition of 104 kV\n\n For the “Real-Time” voltage, according to Table 1, the 116 kV station voltage has a Condition of “Acceptable” because the voltage falls within the defined upper and lower limits of the Acceptable Condition of 121 and 105 kV, respectively. The lowest contingency voltage determined, however, does not fall within the “Acceptable” Condition. This condition does not meet the IROL criteria defined in 3.B.2. above, therefore the lower half of the SOL portion of Table 1 is applicable. For CA, the 104 kV contingency voltage condition is less than 105 kV, but above 102 kV, meaning that the contingency condition is Long Time Emergency Voltage Limit – Low (LTEVL-L). Per the table, the operator has 120 minutes to either take action to mitigate the low voltage condition or develop an Action Plan to resolve the issue post-contingency, per Note 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 15 - System Operating Limits Methodology, Attachment H Revision Number: 10 Revision Date: February 6, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Real-Time Studies|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 6, 2025|\n\n\n### LCC Voltage Limit Operator Aid Tables Legend\n\n#### Table Key :\n\n\n#### Can remain in this state indefinitely\n\n\n#### Can remain in this state at least a period of time, and potentially indefinitely if an Action Plan is developed and the pre-contingent portion is executed Cannot remain in this state - An Action Plan is needed and must be executed to leave this state Staying in this state can result in an SOL / IROL exceedance This state is prohibited - Cannot remain in this state - Must take immediate action to leave this state for an acceptable one – Being in this state may result in an SOL / IROL\n\n Table Notes:\n\n Note 1 : Voltage Limits and associated timelines may not be applicable on radial transmission\n stations (radial either by design or the result of a contingency).

Non-load shedding plans are also allowed if effective. All plans must be able to be completed as soon as possible and well within the allowed time period.\n Note 4 : All NORMAL actions should be taken to return voltage within the NORMAL Low and High\n voltage limits shown in OP-19 Transmission Operations, Appendix K Operating Voltage Limits by LCC (OP-19K).\n Note 5 : These limits are to be applied after any local protection and automatic control action \n (i.e., includes but not limited to; shunt devices, transformer load tap changer (LTC) step changes, etc.)\n Note 6 : Conditions where RTCA indicates voltages > 105% and ≤ 107% per unit (p.u.) may be\n permitted if they can be mitigated in < five minutes post-contingency; if so, the time allowed in this state is “Indefinite”.

Background\n\nThe intent of Master/Local Control Center No. 13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices\n(M/LCC 13) is to establish common ISO New England (ISO) and Local Control Center (LCC)\ncommunication protocols and practices to promote effective communication especially\nbetween the operating personnel of ISO and each LCC. North American Electric Reliability\nCorporation (NERC) Reliability Standard COM-001 - Communications and NERC Reliability\nStandard COM-002 - Operating Personnel Communications Protocols establish\nrequirements for effective communications; NERC Reliability Standard TOP-001 Transmission Operations establishes the requirement to comply with Operating Instructions\nfrom the Transmission Operator (TOP).\n\nISO and each LCC have internal communication procedures that are already established,\nhowever M/LCC 13 is intended to supplement those procedures and provide specific\nguidance for communications practices for ISO and LCCs.\n\n# 3. Responsibilities\n\nISO and each LCC are responsible for precise, accurate, and professional\ncommunications involving collaborative efforts to meet NERC TOP requirements as set\nforth in Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 12 - Identification and Coordination of\nISO and LCC TOP Responsibilities (M/LCC 12).\n\nISO and each LCC are responsible for gathering and providing complete and accurate\ninformation during operational communications. This can be accomplished through verbal\nor electronic Inter Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) telemetry. In the case\nof SOL and IROL Interface exceedances, ICCP will be used to confirm when an\nexceedance occurs and when it is cleared.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices Revision Number: 39 Revision Date: July 31, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nUsing three-part communication is required whenever issuing an Operating Instruction.\nCommunications conducted for the purpose of confirming Interchange Schedules are not\nconsidered Operating Instructions, however, the use of three-part communications is\nexpected. It is considered a best practice to use three-part communication in all situations\nwhere its use will enhance communication.\n\nNERC defines an Operating Instruction as “A command by operating personnel responsible\nfor the Real-time operation of the interconnected Bulk Electric System to change or preserve\nthe state, status, output, or input of an Element of the Bulk Electric System or Facility of the\nBulk Electric System (A discussion of general information and of potential options or\nalternatives to resolve Bulk Electric System operating concerns is not a command and is not\nconsidered an Operating Instruction).” For the purposes of this procedure and other ISO and\nLCC procedures, the term “Operating Instruction” is consistent with the NERC definition of\nthis term. Also, the terms “Operating Instruction” and “directive” as used in ISO and LCC\nprocedures are considered to be equivalent terms.\n\nISO and each LCC are responsible for using three-part communication whenever a\nverbal Operating Instruction is issued.\n\nThe M/LCC Heads are responsible for reviewing M/LCC 13 to assess the effectiveness of\nM/LCC 13 communications protocols and for modifying those protocols, as necessary, to\nenhance their effectiveness.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices Revision Number: 39 Revision Date: July 31, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|\n\n\n# 4. Procedure\n\n**4.1** **Basic Protocol for All Operational Communications**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe initial communication each shift between ISO and each LCC and between ISO and each\nReliability Coordinator (RC) requires stating names and locations. For subsequent\ncommunication during the shift between ISO and each LCC and between ISO and each RC,\nit is acceptable to state names only.\n\nVerbal communication is extremely important and the primary method by which the ISO and\nLCC System Operators provide and receive information.\n\nA. ISO and LCC System Operators verbal communications shall make use of the following\n\nstandard practices:\n\n     - English language shall be used when issuing or receiving an Operating Instruction.\n\n     - Identify yourself, including your name and location.\n```\n      o For ISO System Operators include your assigned desk (e.g., Loader, Generation,\n\n```\nSenior, etc.)\n\n     - Separate the conversational portion of a discussion from the portion when an\n\nOperating Instruction is being issued.\n\n     - Be precise, accurate, and professional.\n\n     - Be proactive rather than reactive in communications.\n\n     - Limit all unnecessary distractions that could hamper good communications.\n\n     - Be free of ambiguity. Avoid the use of slang terms and words that have a similar\n\nsound. Use correct nomenclature for any devices mentioned.\n\n     - Be direct. Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid technical terms and\n\nacronyms. Be aware that technical terms, jargon, and acronyms may be confusing\nand meaningless to people with backgrounds and experience different from your own.\n\n     - Make every effort to provide clear communications and intentions that are understood\n\ncompletely. Listen to cues from the other party to gauge their interest in and\nunderstanding of your comments. If the other party sounds confused or distracted,\nstop speaking and make sure the conversation is on track. If there is a concern of\nmisunderstanding or confusion, stop the evolution and resolve the concerns.\n\n     - Communications with team members shall be concise and prioritized such that urgent\n\nor high consequence information is conveyed with minimum distraction and delay.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices Revision Number: 39 Revision Date: July 31, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|\n\n\n\n  - If a request for information is received, obtain the information and promptly\n\ncommunicate it back to the party or provide the party with a knowledgeable contact.\n\nB. After an exchange of general operational information, the discussion shall be summarized\n\nand acknowledged by the receiver by repeating back enough information in summary so\nthat the issuer knows the issued message was correctly received.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nISO and LCC System Operators should use 24-hour clock time when issuing an Operating\nInstruction with a time identification.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nISO and LCCs do not issue Operating Instructions to any entity outside of the New\nEngland Reliability Control Area (RCA). All Operating Instructions issued by ISO and\nLCCs are to entities within the New England RCA time zone, so there are no instances\nthat would require time zone identification when an Operating Instruction is issued.\nHowever, time zone identification should be used whenever it adds clarity to a discussion.\n\nC. ISO and LCC System Operators shall issue each Operating Instruction in a clear, concise\n\nand definitive manner and use three-part communication, taking one of the following\nactions whenever such Operating Instruction is issued:\n\n  - If the repeated information is correct, confirm the receiver’s response.\n\n  - If the repeated information is wrong or if requested by the receiver, reissue the original\n\nOperating Instruction.\n\n  - If a response is not received or if the Operating Instruction was not understood by the\n\nreceiver, take an alternative action.\n\nD. When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction, the LCC System\n\nOperator shall perform one of the following actions:\n\n  - Repeat, not necessarily verbatim, the Operating Instruction and receive confirmation\n\nfrom the issuer that your response was correct.\n\n  - Request that the issuer restate the Operating Instruction.\n\nE. When an LCC System Operator receives an Operating Instruction from ISO, the LCC\n\nshall comply with the Operating Instruction, or if not able to perform the Operating\nInstruction, the LCC shall immediately inform ISO it cannot perform the required action\n\nF. When an ISO System Operator receives a verbal request to take action from an RC or an\n\nLCC, the ISO System Operator is expected to follow three-part communication protocol\nand perform the requested action, subject to due consideration of the reliability of the\nNew England transmission system.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices Revision Number: 39 Revision Date: July 31, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|\n\n\nG. When an ISO System Operator issues a verbal request to a neighboring RC to take\n\naction, the ISO System Operator is expected to follow three-part communication protocol.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe nomenclature for transmission interface elements and transmission interface\nfacilities can be found in the ISO Interface Limit Calculator (ILC) or in the Generic\nInterface Constraints document on the ISO-NE website found at:\n[https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/pricing/-/tree/pricing-support-documents](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/pricing/-/tree/pricing-support-documents)\n\nH. The nomenclature for transmission interface elements and transmission interface facilities\n\nshall include the following:\n\n  - For a line with two terminals, use the line number identifier\n\n  - For a line with more than two terminals, use the line number identifier and substation\n\n**NOTE**\n\nA single-party to multiple-party burst messaging system is used for notifying or\ncommunicating, by electronic means, a common message to multiple parties in a short\nperiod of time. Although such systems could be used to issue a verbal or written\nOperating Instruction, they are not used for that purpose by ISO and typically not used\nfor that purpose by the LCCs. However, NERC Reliability Standard COM-002 requires\nthat communications protocols for operating personnel require that whenever an\nOperating Instruction is issued using a burst messaging system that the issuer confirm\nor verify that the Operating Instruction was received by at least one receiver of the\nOperating Instruction.\n\nISO/LCC “All LCC” conference calls are treated as a series of two-person\ncommunications requiring repeat-backs from each recipient.\n\nI. If an LCC System Operator issues an Operating Instruction using a single-party to\n\nmultiple-party burst messaging system, the issuer shall confirm or verify that the\nOperating Instruction was received by at least one of the receiving parties.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No.13 - ISO and LCC Communication Practices Revision Number: 39 Revision Date: July 31, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: July 31, 2025|\n\n\n**4.2** **ISO and LCC Communications Involving Normal Operations**\n\n**NOTE**\n\nRoutine Resource Desired Dispatch Points (DDPs) issued by ISO are not communicated to\nthe applicable LCC verbally and do not require any special communications protocols.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nAttachment B - Accepted RAS/ACS Terminology, is a listing of terms that are expected to be\nused when communicating the state of a Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) or Automatic\nControl Scheme (ACS).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSteps 4.2.1.C and 4.2.2.D are not to be changed without agreement from NYISO.\n\nTo avoid a public safety issue, prevent equipment damage, or a violation of any thermal time\nlimit, ISO or the LCC may take immediate action to reduce the flow to within acceptable limits\nprior to making notifications.\n\n_4.2.1 ISO Initiated_\n\nA.

An Operating Emergency exists on the New England BES when one\nor more of the specific set of conditions listed in the Table below occurs.

Objectives\n\nThis procedure is intended to assist the System Restoration Working Group (SRWG)\nin calculating an approximate desired MW amount of Designated Blackstart\nResources (DBRs) for the overall New England System Restoration Plan (the Plan).\nIt also serves to aid in decisions about adding new DBRs based on interconnection\nvoltage levels, as well as replacement of existing DBRs that may be at-risk due to\nResource age. The method employed in this Attachment is not intended to replace\nany study requirements pertaining to DBRs, but rather to provide tools for the SRWG\nto broadly quantify a desired target amount of DBR MW for the Plan and to assist in\nidentifying potential areas of the Plan where it may be beneficial to add or remove\nDBRs.\n\n## 2. Responsibilities\n\nThe SRWG will use the methods found in this Attachment to assist in evaluating\nwhether the number, size, location and diversity of DBRs are sufficient to meet the\nneeds of the Plan.\n\nThe SRWG will use the methods found in this Attachment to assist in determining\nwhether a prospective DBR would be advantageous to the existing Plan.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRev. 2.1 Page 2 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 2.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\n## 3. Calculation of Overall New England DBR MW Target\n\nA. The SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine the DBR MW target using the\n\nfollowing calculation:\n\n1. Determine the total number of Generator Assets with a cold startup +\n\nnotification of more than 30 minutes and less than or equal to 4 hours.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 2, the value of 10 represents average station service load in MW.\n\n2. Multiply the value from Step 1 by 10.\n\n3. Determine the total number of nuclear power stations in New England.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 4, the value of 20 represents average station service load in MW.\n\n4. Multiply the value from Step 3 by 20.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 5, multiplying by 1.2 provides a 20% outage factor for New England DBRs.\n\n5. Add the value from Step 2 to the value from Step 4 and multiply by (1.2).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 6, Summer Seasonal Claimed Capability (S-SCC) MW values for nonhydro DBRs should be obtained from the most recently published Forecast Report\nof Capacity, Energy, Loads, and Transmission (CELT Report). Non-hydro DBRs\nthat have been in-service at least 35 years are classified as “at-risk” from market,\nmaterial, or environmental forces.\n\n6. Determine the total Summer Seasonal Claimed Capability (S-SCC) of non\nhydro DBRs which have been in-service at least 35 years.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 7, the value is a target value for DBR MWs in New England. The SRWG\nwill ultimately determine whether the exact amount of DBR MWs of the fleet is\nsufficient to meet the goals of the Plan.\n\n7. Add the value from Step 5 to the value from Step 6.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRev. 2.1 Page 3 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 2.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\n8. Determine the total MVA Nameplate of all DBRs.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIn Step 9, multiplying by 0.8 provides a DBR MW total assuming 0.8 pf.\n\n9. Multiply the value from Step 8 by 0.8.\n\n10. Compare the value from Step 7 to the value of Step 9.\n\n11. Evaluate whether DBRs should be added to or removed from the Plan based\n\nupon the comparison from Step 10.\n\n**Target DBR MWs = [(# Generator Assets with Cold Startup between 30 minutes and 4 hours)*10**\n\n**MW+(# Nuclear power stations)*20 MW]*1.2 + (S-SCC of non-hydro DBRs >=35 years old)**\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRev. 2.1 Page 4 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 2.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\n## 4. Consideration of DBR Interconnection Voltage\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe DBR Voltage Point Target range is 36-42 points based upon 6-7 system\nrestoration islands. Two (2) DBRs per island at 345 kV is optimal.\n\nA preference for DBRs interconnected at higher voltages was previously established in\nthe SRWG Optimal Blackstart Assessment Study conducted in 2009. This study\ndetermined that a “top-down” approach, with DBRs connecting at higher voltages,\nwould be more efficient for achieving the Plan objectives. To reflect this, and the\nrecent commissioning of several new DBRs interconnecting at 115 kV into the Plan,\nthe SRWG’s evaluation of whether DBRs should be added or removed from the Plan,\nshall use the following voltage point values in the calculations described below:\n\n**DBR interconnection voltage** **Voltage Point Value**\n\n345kV and 115kV 3\n\n230kV 2\n\nAll other 1\n\nA. The SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine the total voltage point value of the\n\nDBR fleet using the following calculation:\n\n1. Determine the interconnection voltage of each DBR.\n\n2. Determine the electrical substation to which each DBR is connected.\n\n3. Remove from the calculation all but one DBR at each electrical substation\n\nconnected at the same voltage level (i.e., if two DBRs connect at the same\nsubstation bus, only one DBR should be counted in the point calculation;\nhowever, two DBRs interconnected at different voltage levels at the same\nsubstation would each be counted in the point value calculation)\n\n4. Multiply each DBR remaining by the appropriate point value shown in the table\n\nabove.\n\n5. Add the point values from Step 4.\n\n6. Compare the point total from Step 5 to the DBR Voltage Point Target range of\n\n36-42 points.\n\n7. Evaluate whether DBRs should be added to or removed from the Plan.\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\nRev. 2.1 Page 5 of 7\n\n|DBR interconnection voltage|Voltage Point Value|\n|---|---|\n|345kV and 115kV|3|\n|230kV|2|\n|All other|1|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan, Attachment G|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 2.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\n## 5. Identification of At-Risk Local Areas\n\nThe SRWG Chair (or designee) will determine if any local areas of the Plan are at risk\nby:\n\n1. Accessing the most recently published Forecast Report of Capacity, Energy,\n\nLoads, and Transmission (CELT Report).\n\n2. Determining whether removing all at-risk (described above in Section 3,\n\nStep 6) DBRs from a path compromises completion of that path’s objectives.\n\n3.

These TOP entities include ISO New England (ISO), which serves as the\nMaster Control Center (MCC), and each of the Local Control Centers (LCCs). This\ngroup was established to share information, identify and resolve operational issues\nand help coordinate the reliable operation of the New England transmission system.\n\n**2.2 TOP Responsibilities Matrix**\n\nSection 5 of this document establishes the process for delineating the\nresponsibilities of ISO and the LCCs for compliance with tasks that pertain to North\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards\nRequirements applicable to the TOP function. Under the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC)-approved Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) structure\nfor New England, certain New England entities play a role in performing some but\n**not all of the tasks associated with the TOP function for which they are registered.**\n\nThe delineation of responsibilities between ISO and LCCs with regard to system\noperations is governed by an important principle. ISO has ultimate authority for the\nReal-Time operation of the New England Transmission System as reflected in the\nFERC-approved Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA) at Section 3.02(d). To\nthe extent there is any disagreement between ISO and an LCC during Real-Time\nsystem conditions, ISO judgment ultimately prevails, thus maintaining a “one set of\nhands on the wheel” philosophy in system operations that is also reflected in ISO\nOperating Procedures (OPs). Of course, when ISO and LCCs confer on operating\ndecisions, the more conservative approach to maintaining system reliability\nconsistent with FERC-approved rules is always respected. In this manner, the\nexecution of TOP tasks between ISO and LCCs as specified in their procedures is\ncarried out in a highly reliable manner. The delineation of TOP responsibilities\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 12 - Identification and Coordination of ISO and LCC TOP Responsibilities Revision Number: 16.1 Revision Date: May 20, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: May 20, 2026|\n\n\nreflects the fact that ISO, as the RTO, has the ultimate oversight and governing\ndocumentation for many of these tasks that are performed jointly by ISO and the\nLCCs. ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1, Central Dispatch Operating\nResponsibilities and Authority (OP-1) and the associated OP-1 Attachment A Assignment of Responsibilities (OP-1 A) are the governing ISO New England\nOperating Documents that discuss the operational relationships that are employed\nwithin the New England Reliability Coordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area\n(RCA/BAA).\n\n**3.** **Responsibilities**\n\n1. ISO and the LCCs are responsible for meeting the responsibilities and\n\nperforming the actions described in Section 4 of this document.\n\n2. ISO and the LCCs are jointly responsible for establishing and updating a TOP\n\nResponsibilities Matrix that delineates the responsibilities of ISO and the LCCs\nwith respect to the Requirement(s) of each NERC Reliability Standard\napplicable to TOPs.[1]\n\n3. The ISO Reliability & Operations Compliance (ROC) business unit is responsible\n\nfor primary maintenance of the TOP Responsibilities Matrix, developing\nproposed updates to reflect new/revised NERC Reliability Standards or\nrevisions for other reasons, as necessary, distributing the document to the\nM/LCC Heads for review and approval, and for verifying that the approved\ndocument is posted on the Satellite website.\n\n4. ISO and the LCCs are responsible for reviewing the TOP Responsibilities Matrix\n\non an annual basis to discuss and delineate responsibilities for new or revised\nNERC Reliability Standards Requirements applicable to TOPs or to discuss any\nother matters pertaining to the document that may be raised by ISO or an LCC.\n\n5. When there is a change in the membership of the Heads group, the M/LCC\n\nHeads Chair is responsible for updating the following ISO email distribution lists:\n“M S Head Only” and “M S Heads Full Distribution List”.\n\n1 The TOP Responsibilities Matrix, which is part of the broader “Assignment of NERC Reliability Standard\n\nResponsibilities for TOP, TP and TSP Functions in New England” spreadsheet file, is posted on the Satellite\nwebsite, with a filter applied to show only the NERC Requirements applicable to the TOP.

Purpose\n\nThis procedure establishes a methodology for each Generator Designated Entity (DE) and\nISO New England (ISO) to communicate the status of a Generator governor by ensuring\nthat a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor is reported to ISO. This reporting\nwill allow ISO to ensure the continued reliable operation of the Bulk Electric System (BES).\n\n# 3. Introduction\n\nISO requires Generator governor performance characteristic reporting and tracking,\nspecifically for the purpose of maintaining the capability of Generators to support control of\nsystem frequency during a BES disturbance.\n\n# 4. Definitions\n\n**Governors: - For the purposes of this procedure a “functioning governor” includes**\n\nhardware or software that provides autonomous frequency-responsive power control.\n\n**Governors Free To Respond: - Turbine governors and HVDC controls, where applicable,**\n\nshould be able to respond to system frequency deviation, unless there is a temporary\noperating problem.\n\n# 5. Applicability\n\nThis procedure applies to all Generators of ten (10) megawatts net output or greater that\nare equipped with governors operational for frequency response per ISO New England\nOperating Procedure No. 14 - Technical Requirements for Generators, Demand Response\nResources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology Regulation Resources\n(OP-14).\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 10 - Generator Governor Control and Operation Revision Number: 9.4 Revision Date: May 8, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: May 8, 2026|\n\n\n# 6. Procedure\n\n**NOTE**\n\nA Generator that does not meet OP-14 criteria and that has been granted an exemption\nby ISO is listed in Attachment A - Generators Exempted from Governor Requirements.\nGenerators listed in Attachment A are not required to meet the governor criteria in OP-14.\n\n1. When reporting a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor, the Generator DE\n\nperforms the following:\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe term “Redeclaration’ used in this procedure is defined in ISO New England Manual\nfor Definitions and Manual M-35 (Manual 35) as “A restatement of a Resource’s\navailability, limits, or other Offer Data, except price, submitted by a Market Participant to\nthe ISO to reflect a change in the status or capability of the Resource or changed by the\nISO based upon the Resource’s actual performance.”\n\nA. If applicable, submit a Redeclaration, per ISO New England Manual for Market\n\nOperations, Manual M-11 (Manual-11) indicating the Generator output is restricted,\nthe level of restriction, and that this restriction is due to a non-functioning or blocked\nGenerator governor control.\n\nB. If the non-functioning or blocked Generator governor does not impact Generator\n\nperformance (i.e. no Redeclaration to Eco Max or MRR is required), directly report\nthe Generator governor status to the ISO Control Room.\n\nC. Project the expected return-to-service time and date.\n\n2. When the Generator governor problem no longer exists, the Generator DE performs\n\nthe following:\n\nA. If applicable, request removal of the Redeclaration, per Manual-11, indicating that\n\nthe Generator output is no longer restricted.\n\nB. If a non-functioning or blocked Generator governor did not impact Generator\n\nperformance (i.e., no Redeclaration to Eco Max or MRR was required), directly\nreport to the ISO Control Room that the Generator governor is now functioning\nproperly.\n\n3. When notified of a Generator governor problem, ISO Control Room Staff performs the\n\nfollowing :\n\nA. If the non-functioning governor restricts Generator performance capabilities, accept\n\nthe Generator Redeclaration.\n\nB.

Create an application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software to track each non\nfunctioning or blocked Generator governor.\n\nD. Notify the applicable Local Control Center (LCC) of the non-functioning or blocked\n\nGenerator governor.\n\n4. Upon notification that a Generator is no longer operating with a non-functioning or\n\nblocked Generator governor, ISO Control Room Staff performs the following :\n\nA. Remove the Generator Redeclaration indicating that the Generator output is no\n\nlonger restricted (if applicable).\n\nB. Enter the return-to-service date and time in the Control Room Event Logserver.\n\nC. Complete the application in the ISO Outage Scheduling software used to track each\n\nnon-functioning or blocked Generator governor.\n\nD. Notify the applicable LCC that the Generator governor is now functional.\n\n# 7.

Purpose\n\nThis procedure defines the processes and responsibilities for maintaining and verifying the\nadequacy of the New England System Restoration Plan (the Plan) to reestablish the New\nEngland Bulk Electric System (BES) in a stable and orderly manner following a partial or total\nshutdown of the New England BES. The New England BES generally consists of facilities\noperated at 100 kV or higher. The Plan is described in Master/Local Control Center Procedure\nNo. 18 – New England System Restoration Plan (M/LCC 18) and the related M/LCC 18\nAttachments. ISO exercises its authority and responsibility to coordinate and promote the\nreliability of the Plan in accordance with this procedure and with applicable North American\nElectric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard Requirements and Northeast Power\nCoordinating Council Inc. (NPCC) criteria. The Plan is the single New England regional system\nrestoration plan that serves as both:\n\n   - the Transmission Operator (TOP) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-005) and\n\n    - the Reliability Coordinator (RC) restoration plan (as pertains to EOP-006).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThese same M/LCC 18 documents also serve as the TOP restoration plan for\n\neach Local Control Center (LCC).\n\nThe Plan is maintained in accordance with the Transmission Operating Agreement (TOA)\nbetween ISO and New England Transmission Owners (TOs) and in consultation with the TOPs\nthat serve as LCCs. The Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC) Heads have created the\nSystem Restoration Working Group (SRWG) and assigned to it responsibility for certain tasks\nwith respect to maintaining, verifying and coordinating the Plan. The SRWG membership is\ncomprised of TOs, including representatives from each LCC and ISO (with an ISO staff\nmember serving as SRWG Chair). ISO and LCC responsibilities for maintaining and verifying\nthe adequacy of the Plan are generally met by the SRWG, which reports to the M/LCC Heads.\nSection 4 documents the responsibilities of SRWG members. Attachment F contains the\nSystem Restoration Working Group Charter.\n\nThe Plan is evaluated by the SRWG through a combination of computer model simulations and\nsystem restoration exercises that verify that the Plan accomplishes its intended function of\nrestoring the New England BES following a partial or total shutdown of the electric system.

Background\n\n**3.1 The Purpose and Characteristics of the Plan**\n\nThe Plan is designed to restore the New England BES in the event of a partial or total\nshutdown of the New England BES. The Plan is comprised of Primary and Alternate\nPaths to nuclear power stations and also includes restoration strategies designed to\nachieve the objectives of regional restoration when other system restoration paths are\nunavailable. From the RC perspective, the Plan ends when the following objectives are\nachieved:\n\n1) Provide off-site ac power to the New England nuclear power stations\n\n2) Interconnect all New England TOPs (i.e., the LCCs)\n\n3) Establish interconnections/synchronizations with contiguous Reliability Coordinator\n\nAreas (RCAs) that are normally synchronously connected to the New England\nRCA, advancing system restoration of the Eastern Interconnection\n\nWhen these three objectives have been achieved and, in accordance with EOP-005, the\nchoice of the next load to be restored is not driven by the need to control frequency or\nvoltage, implementation of the Plan shall be considered to have been completed. ISO\nrecognizes that, upon completion of the Plan, LCC local recovery actions may still be\nongoing for the energization of remaining New England load. The local area recovery\nactions of each LCC are documented in their respective Local Area Recovery Instructions\n(LARIs), which are not part of the Plan. As necessary, ISO will continue to coordinate with\neach LCC when restoring load to remaining areas of New England, while each LCC\nimplements its respective LARIs.1\n\nThe Plan is designed to establish procedures and provide the facilities and personnel\nnecessary to enable system restoration from certain Designated Blackstart Resources\n(DBRs) that are part of the Plan and to maintain reliability and resiliency during system\nrestoration. DBRs are blackstart Generators that receive compensation for providing\nBlackstart Service under Schedule 16 - Blackstart Service (Schedule 16) of the ISO New\nEngland Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff Section II - Open Access\nTransmission Tariff (OATT). DBRs are listed in M/LCC 18, Attachment O - Designated\nBlackstart Resources (M/LCC 18O) (Confidential). M/LCC 18, Attachment A - System\nRestoration Flowchart (M/LCC 18A) (Confidential) documents each facility and element\ncomprising each cranking path from each DBR to the Generator(s) to be started. M/LCC\n18A also includes a listing of each group of elements meeting the initial transmission lineswitching operations requirements from an operating DBR up to and including the first\ninterconnection/synchronization point of the starting station service of the next generation\n\n1 Energizations of Defense Critical Electric Infrastructure (DCEI) facilities is a top priority for Transmission Owners (TOs) and the TO should\n\nalign recovery of these facilities with the restoration of load to support the Plan objectives. Restoration of DCEI facilities should not conflict\nwith the Plan objectives. When possible, DCEI facilities should be excluded from under-frequency load shed plans. If unable to be excluded,\nDCEI facilities should be assigned the lowest priority for load shed.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: 19.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\nunit(s) to be started (typically on the low side of the Generator Step-up Transformer\n(GSU). Recognizing that the technical aspects of system restoration (e.g., Resource\nstartups, load pickups, switching surges, voltages, frequency, synchronization of islands,\netc.) are crucial, the Plan has been developed in a coordinated fashion with the LCCs and\nneighboring RCs.\n\nIn accordance with NERC Reliability Standards, ISO requires that LCC system restoration\nstrategies and associated actions, as described in the Plan, are coordinated and\nconsistent with the ISO high-level strategy for restoring the New England BES. ISO\nincorporates into the Plan any modification developed or recommended by an LCC to any\nPlan document, subject to the provisions in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.\n\nISO New England Operating Procedure No. 1 - Central Dispatch Operating\nResponsibilities and Authority, Appendix A - Assignment of Responsibilities (OP-1A) also\nincludes responsibilities of ISO, the LCCs, other TOs and Market Participants (MPs),\nincluding GOPs, during system restoration.\n\n**3.2 Components of the Plan**\n\nThe Plan is comprised of general restoration strategies as per Attachment A, as well as a\ncollection of specifically defined interconnected contiguous system restoration paths (Primary\nand Alternate Paths to nuclear power stations) from the generation substations associated with\nthe first Generators to be cranked by the DBRs and on to other substations along the Paths,\nultimately connecting to New England nuclear power stations, inter-LCC ties or\ninterconnections/synchronizations with neighboring RCAs, including, but not limited to, M/LCC\n18, Attachment M – Paths to Alternative Cranked Generators (M/LCC 18M) (Confidential)\n\n**1. Basic Minimum Power System and Key Facilities**\n\nAs part of the development of the Plan, ISO has classified certain facilities within the\nPlan in accordance with categories of system restoration plan facilities established\nin NPCC Regional Reliability Reference Directory #8, System Restoration (NPCC\nDirectory #8). The Plan includes facilities that form electrical islands that are part of\nthe core of the Plan. Each of these islands constitutes a basic minimum power\nsystem (BMPS), as defined in NPCC Directory #8. Each of these BMPS islands\nconsists of a DBR and may also include other facilities such as a generation\nsubstation associated with the first Generator to be cranked by the DBR, as well as\ntransmission lines and associated other transmission substations connected to load\nthat are necessary to stabilize the system and establish a stable island for the\npurpose of initiating the Plan. Establishment of these BMPS islands facilitates the\ncapability to synchronize electrical islands and implement the Plan to meet Plan\nobjectives. ISO considered the configuration of the New England BES and the\ndesign of the Plan in its identification of BMPS island facilities. In the event of a\nsystem blackout, the initial goal of the Plan is to establish each BMPS island. From\nthese BMPS islands, station service power to nuclear power stations can be reestablished and interconnections/synchronizations between LCCs and between ISO\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: 19.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\nand neighboring RCAs can be restored, while also allowing for the continued\nrecovery of the New England RCA. These BMPS islands include certain facilities\n(e.g., DBRs and generation/transmission substations) designated as key facilities\n(KFs), as defined by NPCC Glossary of Terms.\n\nKFs include BMPS island facilities that ISO considers essential to the initiation of\nthe Plan and necessary to the establishment of a BMPS island following a system\nblackout. BMPS island KFs include generating stations containing DBRs and may\nalso include other facilities determined to be essential to the establishment of a\nBMPS stable island, such as substations required to provide those DBRs with\nstabilizing load, or generation substations associated with the first Generators to be\ncranked along the paths of the Plan. KFs may also include additional facilities that\nare not part of a BMPS island, but that are considered essential to the\nestablishment of a BMPS island. These additional non-BMPS KFs include:\n\n     - Control centers and telecommunication facilities which are necessary to\n\nsupport protection and control facilities\n\n     - Voice and data circuits between and within control centers\n\n     - Voice and data circuits between control centers and BMPS island KF\n\ngenerating / transmission substations\n\n**2. Facilities Connecting the BMPS Island to Facilities Considered Plan Objectives**\n\nA facility in the Plan that is part of a path from a BMPS island facility to a facility that is\na Plan objective (either an interconnection/synchronization point or a nuclear power\nstation) is referred to as an RFIN (restoration facility to interconnection/synchronization\npoint or a nuclear power station). An RFIN includes all other non-BMPS facilities in\nthe Plan that are not KFs. An RFIN includes:\n\n    - Primary Path facilities that connect BMPS island KFs along contiguous paths to\n\nnuclear power stations in New England or to interconnection/synchronization\npoints with LCCs and/or neighboring RCAs, as well as other selected facilities\ninterconnected to a BMPS island.\n\n    - Alternate Path facilities and other Plan facilities used as part of the system\n\nrestoration strategies of the Plan to restore the transmission system that can\nsupport the achievement of Plan objectives if one or more BMPS island KFs are\nunavailable\n\n    - Voice and data circuits between RFIN generating / transmission substations\n\n**3. List of Plan Facilities**\n\nISO maintains a list of Plan facilities, M/LCC 11, Attachment D – New England System\nRestoration Plan Resources List (NESRPR List) (M/LCC 11D).

The NESRPR List, which identifies the facilities along the paths to the Plan\nobjectives, is updated by ISO once a year (or more often as necessary). ISO informs\nentities about how their facilities have been designated in the Plan in accordance with\nSection 4.6.4.\n\n**3.3 Maintenance, Testing and Reporting Requirements for Plan Facilities**\n\n**1. Maintenance, Testing and Reporting Requirements for Critical Components of**\n\n**Key Facilities**\n\nAny entity that owns a KF is responsible for identifying each KF critical component\n(KFCC) within that KF, in accordance with NPCC Directory #8. KFCCs may include\nbut are not limited to equipment such as a blackstart generating unit or substation\nbackup power supply (battery, backup generator, etc.) that is required for continued\nand proper operation of a KF in the event of a total loss of grid supply. Owners of\nKFCCs are required to maintain a current list of KFCCs, perform required maintenance\nand testing of KFCCs and report failures of KFCCs or test failures of KFCCs to ISO in\naccordance with NPCC Directory #8 and ISO OP-1A. For a newly identified or\nproposed KF, ISO allows the initial test(s) of the KFCC(s) of that KF that are required\nby NPCC Directory #8 to be completed within one year of the implementation date that\nthe facility becomes a KF in the Plan. NPCC Directory #8 also requires KF owners to\nprovide a summary of the maintenance and testing records for KFCC equipment to\nISO, upon request.\n\nUnplanned outages of KFCC facilities are communicated between the ISO and LCCs\nin accordance with Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 13 - ISO and LCC\nCommunication Practices (M/LCC 13) and ISO CROP.50001 Reporting Procedure.\nRecords of these equipment outages are maintained in the ISO Outage Scheduling\nSoftware. The SRWG reviews such KFCC failures or test failures (in accordance with\nSection 4.1), evaluates the implications of such failures on the Plan (in accordance\nwith Section 4.2) and takes whatever action is necessary and appropriate to modify the\nPlan or the implementation of the Plan (in accordance with Section 4.3).\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 11 - Maintenance and Verification of New England System Restoration Plan Revision Number: 19.1 Revision Date: February 21, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) Chair|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 21, 2025|\n\n\n# 4.

All components of the RCS must be functional for the AVR flag to indicate “ON”; conversely, failure of or limited operation of any RCS component should result in the AVR flag indicating “OFF”.\n\n The ISO Transmission Operating Guides (TOGs) refer to each Generator RCS as an AVR.\n\n  Generators listed in the Table 1 below have an RCS, and the components that comprise\n their RCS are indicated by “X” in Table 1\n\n  Assuming correct functioning of the Generator’s AVR flag in the ISO EMS, outage of any\n RCS equipment will cause the AVR flag to toggle to “OFF”, and ISO operators will be notified via EMS alarm. Generator operators shall also notify ISO control room of an RCS component that is compromised.\n\n  In the event that an RCS is not fully functional, any identified impact of the AVR OFF flag\n will be indicated in applicable TOGs, and may be reflected in any limits in ILC. The real time on-call engineer may be contacted if there are any questions.\n\n|Table 1 - Generators Requiring a Reactive Control System|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|LCC|Asset ID|ISO EMS ID|Generator Name|Load Tap Changing Transformer|FACTS*/ Synchronous Condenser|Capacitors|Dynamic Reactive Controller Equipment|\n|Maine|37105|BNGW|Bingham Wind||X||X|\n|Maine|40343|BLHW|Bull Hill Wind|X|||X|\n|Maine|48082|HANW|Hancock Wind|X|X||X|\n|Maine|12551|KIBY|Kibby Wind Power|X|X|X|X|\n|Maine|46951|OAKW|Oakfield Wind||X||X|\n|Maine|38417|PASW|Passadumkeag Wind||X||X|\n|Maine|68734|WEVW|Weaver Wind|X|X||X|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages, Attachment C|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 5.1 Revision Date: September 7, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 7, 2025|\n\n|Table 1 - Generators Requiring a Reactive Control System|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|LCC|Asset ID|ISO EMS ID|Generator Name|Load Tap Changing Transformer|FACTS*/ Synchronous Condenser|Capacitors|Dynamic Reactive Controller Equipment|\n|New Hampshire|14595|GRPW|Granite Reliable Power Wind||X|X|X|\n|New Hampshire|37050|GROW|Groton Wind||X||X|\n|VELCO|35979|KCW|Kingdom Community Wind|X|X||X|\n|||||||||\n\n\n\n### * A Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device is defined by the IEEE as \"a power electronic based system\n\n##### and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability\".

Introduction\n\nISO New England (ISO) Operating Procedure No. 12 - Voltage and Reactive Control\n(OP-12) and ISO Operating Procedure No. 14 Technical Requirements for Generators,\nDemand Response Resources, Asset Related Demands and Alternative Technology\nRegulation Resources (OP-14) establish the guidelines to ensure that reliable and\ndesirable voltage levels are maintained on the New England Transmission System. The\nreliability of the system is dependent upon the automatic operation of Generator, as\ndefined in OP-14, reactive controls. If these devices are removed from service, the ability\nof the power system to respond dynamically to normal power changes, unplanned events\nand abnormal conditions will be impacted. The ISO Control Room Staff must be notified\nimmediately of any reduction in capability regarding automatic voltage control in order to\nconduct studies and formulate contingency actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\n# 4. Responsibilities\n\nThe following steps outline the task performance responsibilities of the Market Participant\ngenerating station operator (or designee), the LCC System Operator, and the ISO Control\nRoom staff:\n\nA.

Definitions\n\n**Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR):**\n\nA voltage-regulating device designed to hold a set voltage by comparing the Reactive\nResource terminal voltage to the reference voltage. AVR equipment may include, but is\n**not limited to any of the following: synchronous generator AVR, centralized voltage**\ncontroller typically implemented in renewable power plants, and Distributed Control\nSystem (DCS).\n\n**Power System Stabilizer (PSS):**\n\nAn electronic control system applied at a generator that helps to dampen out dynamic\noscillations. Such devices, when installed at a generator, can be an integral component\nof the generator’s ability to respond to dynamic disturbances of the power system.\n\n**Reactive Control System (RCS):**\n\nA comprehensive voltage regulation scheme or system at a generating station that\nmaintains steady-state and/or transient voltage stability by deploying multiple reactive\ncontrol devices including, but not limited to any of the following: capacitor/reactor bank,\nFlexible AC Transmission System (FACTS), Static Var Compensator (SVC),\nsynchronous condenser, and load tap changing (LTC) transformer, etc. For example, the\ntypical RCS in a renewable energy wind facility consisting of a STATCOM, a LTC\ntransformer, shunt capacitors and online turbines which function simultaneously, in a\nspecific coordinated fashion, to maintain the POI and collector system voltages within a\npredefined band. An RCS is typically required to be in-service for normal generator\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\n# 6. Applicability\n\nThis procedure applies to:\n\n     - All Market Participant Generators, which are required to have an AVR and operate\n\nit in the automatic voltage regulation mode. Generators exempted from the\nrequirement to have an AVR in automatic are listed in Attachment A - Generators\nExempted from AVR Requirements (M/LCC 8A).\n\n     - All Market Participant Generators required to have a PSS, as determined by and\n\ndocumented in their System Impact Study (SIS). Generators equipped with a PSS\nare required to maintain the state of that PSS as described in Attachment B Generators Requiring PSS Devices In/Out of Service (M/LCC 8B).\n\n     - All Market Participant Generators required to have an RCS in service are listed in\n\nAttachment C - Generators Requiring a Reactive Control System (M/LCC 8C)\n\n# 7. Exempting Generators from Automatic Voltage Control Requirements\n\nCertain Generators, described in M/LCC 8A, within the New England RCA are exempted\nfrom the requirement to operate with an AVR in-service and controlling voltage because\nthey either (1) do not have an AVR or (2) operation with the AVR in the automatic voltage\ncontrol mode and controlling voltage may adversely impact reliability. For all such\nGenerators, ISO and the LCC have reviewed the impact and have determined that the\nlack of automatic voltage control is acceptable or required.\n\nA Generator is listed in M/LCC 8A, when the Market Participant submits an exemption\nrequest to ISO and if that Generator is: (1) not required to have an AVR by Schedule 22\nLarge Generator Interconnection Procedure (LGIP) / Schedule 23 Small Generator\nInterconnection Procedure (SGIP) processes or their predecessor or successor\nprovisions, and (2) that request is evaluated by both the LCC and ISO in order to\ndetermine what type of exemption study is required. An exemption request determination\nby the LCC and ISO may require that the exemption request and study be performed and\napproved under Section I.3.9 Review of Market Participant’s Proposed Plans of the ISO\nTariff (PPA Process) and supported by reliability studies performed by ISO System\nPlanning. Initial screening criteria for a Generator exemption request to determine if a full\nPPA Process is required are contained in Section 7.A of this M/LCC procedure.\nRegardless of whether or not a Generator AVR exemption request meets the initial\nscreening exemption criteria, ISO reserves the right to determine if that request requires a\nfull PPA Process application.\n\nInclusion of a Generator in the M/LCC 8A exemption list does not preclude re-evaluation\nrequired with changes processed through the LGIP or SGIP processes, or their\npredecessor or successor provisions, respectively, and an exemption may be precluded\nby Schedules 22 or 23 for Interconnection Requests under those processes. Inclusion in\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\nthe M/LCC 8A exemption list does not relieve a Generator from adhering to any other ISO\nNew England Operating Document or program requirements.\n\nA. Proposed Plan Application Process Exemption Criteria\n\nTypically, an AVR exemption request for a Generator Reactive Resource that is not\nprecluded for Interconnection Requests under Schedules 22 or 23 and that meets any\none of the criteria contained in Section 7.A.1 of this M/LCC, does not require a full PPA\nProcess in order to approve or deny the AVR exemption request.\n\n1. The Generator shall:\n\n    - Be connected to the transmission or distribution system at a voltage level less\n\nthan 69 kV\n\n    - Have a total plant gross output at a common point of connection, as described in\n\nOP-14, of less than 20 MW Summer or Winter Network Resource Capability\n(NRC), whichever is greater\n\n   - Have never been equipped with an AVR\n\nAny Generator seeking an exemption shall provide to ISO a detailed description of how\nthe plant will be operated in lieu of active AVR control (i.e., in manual control or constant\npower factor control mode), including the expected reactive capability (lagging and\nleading) the plant may utilize over the course of daily operation.\n\nIf the Generator for which the AVR exemption is sought has no prior PPA application with\nISO and the AVR exemption request is submitted prior to being determined ready to\nrespond to dispatch by ISO, the Lead MP shall:\n\n1. Submit an AVR exemption request via the ISO Participant Support Ask ISO\n\napplication. Such application shall include at a minimum the following\ndocumentation:\n\na. A technical analysis supporting acceptable operation without the AVR\n\noperating in voltage control mode\n\nb. A valid technical reason, normally provided by the interconnecting\n\ntransmission or distribution utility, stating the reason that the Generator\ncannot operate with its AVR in voltage control mode\n\nISO and the LCCs shall use this information in their review of the exemption request.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\n# 8. Request and Approve an AVR, PSS or RCS Outage\n\n**NOTE**\n\nAVR mode changes during normal start-up and shutdown of units are expected and\nneed not be reported to ISO.\n\n**Planned Outages:**\n\nThe Market Participant Generator Operator (GOP) shall notify the LCC of any planned\nmaintenance of the AVR, PSS or RCS that reduces the capacity of the equipment or\nrenders the equipment inoperable. The GOP shall submit an outage request for the AVR,\nPSS or RCS via the ISO outage scheduling software. The ISO OSS Outage Coordination\ngroup and the OSS Real-Time Studies group shall perform appropriate analysis and\napprove or disapprove the outage request with the concurrence of the LCC. Approved\noutage requests for AVR, PSS, or RCS equipment that limits generation in accordance\nwith a Transmission Operating Guide (TOG), or other guidance from OSS, will be entered\nin the ISO outage scheduling software as a transmission outage application, in addition to\nthe corresponding generation application. Prior to the start or completion of an approved\nplanned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS, the Market Participant GOP shall also contact\nboth the ISO Control Room and the LCC for final review and approval.\n\n**Emergency or Forced Outages:**\n\nThe Market Participant GOP shall notify the ISO Control Room staff of an emergency or\nforced outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS that reduces the capacity of the equipment or\nrenders the equipment inoperable. The ISO shall notify the appropriate LCC of the AVR\nemergency or forced outage. The LCC shall instruct the Generator with the AVR outage\nto maintain or change either its voltage schedule or its reactive power. Any outage of an\nAVR, PSS or RCS shall be logged by the LCC and ISO Control Room staff. If an AVR,\nPSS is out-of-service or there is any reduction in RCS capability for more than 30\nminutes, the ISO Control Room staff shall create an outage in the ISO outage scheduling\nsoftware. ISO Control Room staff and the OSS Real-Time Studies group (on-call\nengineer) shall perform the necessary analysis to determine what, if any, corrective\nactions are required. Applications for AVR, PSS, or RCS equipment that limits generation\nin accordance with a TOG, or other guidance from OSS, will be entered in the ISO outage\nscheduling software as a transmission outage application in addition to the corresponding\ngeneration application. The ISO Control Room staff shall obtain concurrence from the\nLCC if any corrective actions are required.\n\n**Criteria for Evaluating the Impact of an AVR, PSS or RCS Outage:**\n\nThe ISO OSS Real-Time Studies group shall perform the appropriate analysis or studies\nnecessary to:\n\n     - Evaluate planned maintenance of any AVR, PSS or RCS that may result in the\n\nequipment capacity being reduced or being removed from service, determine if the\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\nrequest for the planned outage shall be approved or disapproved, and obtain the\nconcurrence of the LCC System Operator.\n\n  - Evaluate planned maintenance of any AVR, PSS or RCS that may result in the\n\nequipment capacity being reduced or being removed from service and determine\nthe plant or system restrictions that exist for the planned maintenance condition(s).\n\n  - Re-evaluate a previously approved planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS at the\n\ntime that the equipment is actually to be taken out-of-service, taking into account\nany changes to system conditions since the original evaluation and approval, and\ndetermine if the request for the equipment to be taken out-of-service shall be\napproved or disapproved.\n\nIn performing the appropriate analysis or studies in order to determine whether to approve\nor disapprove the planned outage of an AVR, PSS or RCS or to determine what, if any,\ncorrective actions are required in the event of an emergency or forced outage of an AVR,\nPSS or RCS, the criteria considered by the ISO OSS Real-Time Studies group includes,\nbut would not necessarily be limited to the following:\n\n  - Industry standards and guidelines for reliable system operation provided by NERC\n\n(notably, in NERC Reliability Standards TOP-001, TOP-002, and VAR-001) and\nNPCC.\n\n  - ISO requirements for reliable system operations as documented in ISO New\n\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 19 - Transmission Operations (OP-19).\n\n  - Impact of the change on the system’s voltage performance, reactive reserves\n\nand/or stability behavior which may in turn impact system operability and reliability,\nreduce system transfer limits and degrade network stability performance.\n\nIn addition, there are certain situations where the removal from service of an AVR, PSS,\nor RCS should be avoided, including the following:\n\n  - An AVR, PSS, or RCS that is required to be in-service should not be removed from\n\nservice when Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions\nAlert (M/LCC 2) is implemented, unless the outage is unavoidable.\n\n  - The simultaneous removal from service of several AVRs, PSSs or RCSs in any one\n\narea should be avoided.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|M/LCC Procedure No. 8 - Coordination of Generator Voltage Regulator and Power System Stabilizer Outages|\n|---|---|\n||Revision Number: 18.1 Revision Date: September 20, 2023|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: September 20, 2025|\n\n\n# 9.

Purpose\n\n1. This Master/Local Control Center (M/LCC) procedure attachment describes the\n\nprocesses used to update and verify the list of ISO-New England (ISO) Reliability\nCoordinator Area Bulk Electric System (BES) elements that are monitored and protected\nby ISO and Local Control Center (LCC) System Operators. This list consists of BES\nelements, Category A and B elements (as defined in the Transmission Operating\nAgreement [TOA]), and Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF).\n\n## II. Introduction\n\n1. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) BES definition[1] became\n\nenforceable as of July 1, 2016. In accordance with NERC Interconnection Reliability\nOperations and Coordination (IRO) standards, the Reliability Coordinator shall monitor\nBES elements that could result in a System Operating Limit (SOL) or an Interconnection\nReliability Operating Limit (IROL).\n\n2. This attachment is used to update and verify the ISO-NE BES list and provides: a list of\n\nrelated ISO Short Term Outage Coordination Group (STOCG) and Power System Model\nManagement (PSMM) responsibilities, a list of STOCG tasks used to update the BES\nlist, the definition of Category B Treated as Category A, and related information and\nlinks.\n\n3. The ISO-NE BES element list is located on the OASIS website at the following link:\n\n[http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n\n[01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n\n1 FERC Approved Definition of BES\n[http://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/BES%20DL/BES%20Definition%20Approved%20by%20FERC%203-20-14.pdf](http://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/BES%20DL/BES%20Definition%20Approved%20by%20FERC%203-20-14.pdf)\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. - 7 Processing Transmission Applications, Attachment C Revision Number: 4.2 Revision Date: March 27, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operation Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 27, 2026|\n\n\n## III. Responsibilities\n\n1. The STOCG is responsible for utilizing this Attachment to update the posted BES\n\nelements list.\n\n2. The STOCG is responsible for updating the BES elements list three times a year in\n\nalignment with the ISO-NE network model update.\n\n3. The STOCG is responsible for informing the PSMM group of any added and/or removed\n\nBES element(s).\n\n4. The PSMM group is responsible for updating the long term planning model utilized by the\n\nOperations Support Services group.\n\n## IV. Update the BES Element List\n\n1. Prior to each ISO-NE Energy Management System (EMS) network model update and\n\nduring update coordination meetings, the STOCG shall perform the following tasks:\n\nA. Work with the PSMM group on adding and/or removing any network model BES\n\nelement(s).\n\nB. Edit the ISO-NE BES elements list for any added and/or removed BES element(s).\n\n[C. Email notification to the PSMM group at ITops@iso-ne.com for any BES element(s)](mailto:ITops@iso-ne.com)\n\nadded and/or removed from the BES elements list.\n\nD. Work with Transmission Planning to label any added BES element(s) as Pool\n\nTransmission Facilities (PTF).\n\nE. Contact each applicable Transmission Owner for approval of an edit to the ISO-NE\n\nBES elements list and resolve any conflicts.\n\nF. Post the approved revised ISO-NE BES elements list at:\n\n[http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n\n[01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n\n**Hard Copy Is Uncontrolled**\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. - 7 Processing Transmission Applications, Attachment C Revision Number: 4.2 Revision Date: March 27, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operation Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: March 27, 2026|\n\n\n## V. Definition of Category B Treated as Category A\n\n1. Any element that is classified as BES by the Transmission Owner that is not Category A\n\nunder the TOA is being re-designated by ISO as Category B treated as Category A.

Purpose\n\nThis procedure is applicable to both the Long Term and Short Term Outage Scheduling\nprocesses as defined within ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 Transmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3). Outage requests containing Major\nTransmission Elements (MTE) or critical 345kV line paths require greater coordination\nas they may have a significant impact on the reliable and/or economic operation of the\nNew England Transmission System and as a result, may have greater potential to being\ncancelled or denied due to economic impacts, than other transmission facilities. A list of\nMTE equipment can be found in Attachment E - Major Transmission Element Listing\nand critical 345kV line paths can be found in Attachment F - Critical 345 kV Power\nTransfer Paths. The outage coordination process is driven by the categorization of Bulk\nElectric System (BES) facilities. The process for verifying and updating of these\ntransmission facilities can be found in Attachment C - Outage Coordination Verification\nand Revision Process for BES Category A and Category B Facilities. A complete list of\nBES Category A and B Facilities can be found on the ISO New England (ISO) OASIS\nwebsite using the following link.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 7 - Processing Outage Applications Revision Number: 25 Revision Date: February 1, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|\n\n\n[http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n[01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf](http://www.oasis.oati.com/woa/docs/ISNE/ISNEdocs/TOA__Sched__2-01A_and_B_and_BES__Facilities.pdf)\n\nThis procedure describes the process of submitting transmission outage applications\ninternally within the New England Reliability Control Area/Balancing Authority Area\n(RCA/BAA) between the Local Control Centers (LCCs) and ISO. The ISO Outage\nScheduling software is the primary tool used to process all basic information required for\neach transmission outage application. The use of the ISO Outage Scheduling software\nalso allows ISO to efficiently communicate its study results to an LCC.\n\nThis procedure is not intended to replace the telephone conversations held between\nISO and any LCC concerning the impact of any transmission outage application on the\noperation of the New England Transmission System. It is merely intended to streamline\nthe process of submitting transmission outage applications from the LCCs to ISO.\nWhen the ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, email is used to\ncommunicate transmission outage applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 7 - Processing Outage Applications Revision Number: 25 Revision Date: February 1, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|\n\n\n# 3. Procedure\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe ISO Outage Scheduling software is used to communicate transmission outage\napplications.\n\n     - The intent of this software is to allow each LCC to submit all pertinent information\n\nregarding each transmission facility outage.\n\n     - The ISO Outage Coordination group and the ISO Security Operator evaluate\n\ntransmission outage applications submitted using the ISO Outage Scheduling\nsoftware.\n\n     - The ISO Outage Scheduling software will automatically log transmission outage\n\napplications as they are submitted to ISO.\n\nISO and each LCC responsibilities associated with processing transmission outage\napplications are clearly defined in OP-3 and ISO New England System Operating\nProcedure SOP-RTMKTS.0180.0055 - Process and Perform Reactive Capability Tests.\nPlanned transmission outages must be submitted within the prescribed timelines\nprovided in this Procedure - Attachment D - Minimum Advance Notice Times - Outage\nRequests for Specific Equipment.\n\nISO and each LCC are responsible for the communication and coordination of\ntransmission outage applications that directly affect any element that is defined in\nMaster/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations\n(M/LCC 1) as specified in the following Attachments:\n\n     - M/LCC 1 Attachment C - Millstone Nuclear Power Station\n\n     - M/LCC 1 Attachment D - Seabrook Nuclear Power Station\n\nOutside of normal working hours or in the absence of personnel from the ISO Outage\nCoordination group, the ISO Security Operator and each applicable LCC Operator is\nresponsible for processing transmission outage applications.\n\nISO does not perform voltage reliability studies prior to Real-Time for reactive tests on\nResources with reactive capability less than ten (10) MVAr.\n\n1. The transmission outage application process for ISO and each LCC shall be performed\n\nas follows:\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe transmission outage application transmittal is available to ISO in the ISO Outage\nScheduling software as a Submitted Application.\n\nA. The LCC shall prepare all necessary LCC informational items using the ISO Outage\n\nScheduling software. Transmission outage applications identified as NRA or relay\nwork shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with M/LCC7 Attachment D,\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 7 - Processing Outage Applications Revision Number: 25 Revision Date: February 1, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|\n\n\nand OP24 Appendix C, respectively.\n\n1) When the LCC has completed the informational items, the transmission outage\n\napplication shall be transmitted (Submitted) to ISO.\n\na. To promote efficient coordination, if the transmitted transmission outage\n\napplication has associated or supporting outages (e.g., transmission\nswitching, creating air gap, etc.) ISO shall request the LCC to link these\noutages.\n\nB. If ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, the LCC shall:\n\n1) On M/LCC 7 Attachment A - ISO Transmission Facility Outage Request Form\n\nenter all necessary items listed in the “To Be Completed by Local Control\nCenter” section.\n\n2) Email the completed Attachment A to ISO.\n\nC. If a transmission outage application is transmitted by an email outside of normal\n\nworking hours, the LCC shall make a telephone call to notify the ISO Security\nOperator of the email.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe ISO Outage Scheduling software automatically assigns application numbers when\nthe transmission outage application is submitted to ISO. Receipt by ISO is understood\nto have occurred when an application number is assigned.\n\nD. When a transmission outage application is being studied, the ISO Outage\n\nCoordination group/ISO Security Operator shall place the transmission outage\napplication in the Study mode in the ISO Outage Scheduling software.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nUntil a transmission outage application is placed in the Study mode by ISO, that\napplication can be altered by the LCC.\n\n1) ISO shall update the ISO Outage Scheduling software with the necessary\n\nchanges to the transmission outage application.\n\nE. If an email is used, upon receipt of the transmission outage application form by\n\nemail, the ISO Outage Coordination group / Security Operator shall:\n\n1) Call the LCC to acknowledge receipt of the transmission outage application form\n\nby email.\n\na. Note 1C above.\n\n2) Assign the transmission outage application received by email, an ISO application\n\nnumber by entering the transmission outage application into the ISO Outage\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 7 - Processing Outage Applications Revision Number: 25 Revision Date: February 1, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|\n\n\nScheduling software.\n\nF. If the ISO Outage Scheduling software is not available, by 1600 hours each day, the\n\nLCC shall verify that an application number has been received for each application\ntransmitted by email to ISO that day.\n\n1) Any discrepancies shall be reported to ISO to verify that an application has not\n\nbeen inadvertently overlooked or lost in the email process.\n\n2) Once the ISO Outage Scheduling software is returned to service, the ISO\n\nOutage Coordination group shall enter the outage information received by email.\n\nG. The ISO Outage Coordination group/ISO Security Operator shall discuss the\n\ndetailed transmission outage application with the LCC, when additional analysis is\nrequired to provide complete understanding of the transmission outage application\nand to obtain all necessary inputs to the ISO study and decision-making process.\n\n1) Items to be discussed may include, but are not limited to:\n\n    - Facility (name and nomenclature)\n\n   - Outage Cause Code and Sub-Cause Code\n\n    - Reason for application (description of work to be performed)\n\n    - Emergency restoration time\n\n    - Time and date switching is to begin\n\n    - Time and date the facility is to be restored to normal operation\n\n    - Any LCC and /or system outside of the New England RCA/BAA to whom\n\nnotifications have been given\n\n    - Other information pertinent to the application that may affect an ISO decision,\n\nsuch as a request to revise a Resource outage schedule to address\ncongestion issues with the transmission outage\n\n    - LCC analysis results and approval including contingencies and limiting\n\nelements, local voltage constraints, must-run Resource and restricted\nResources.\n\n    - Relevant ISO/LCC communication and coordination efforts that have been\n\nperformed with nuclear power stations for those elements identified in\nM/LCC 1 and Attachments C or D that affect one or more Nuclear Plant\nInterface Requirements (NPIRs).\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 7 - Processing Outage Applications Revision Number: 25 Revision Date: February 1, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: ISO Director, Operations Support Services|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: February 1, 2026|\n\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe coordination and communication of planned transmission outages must be\nconducted in a manner that respects the potential need to perform system restoration\nwhen planned or unplanned outages occur.

Introduction\n\nEstablished operating procedures provide an approval process for any outage of the\nfollowing:\n\n  - Resources in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource\n\nMaintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5)\n\n  - Transmission maintenance in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 \nTransmission Outage Scheduling (OP-3)\n\n  - Maintenance of dispatch computer and communications equipment in ISO New\n\nEngland Operating Procedure No. 2 - Maintenance of Communications,\nComputers, Metering, and Computer Support Equipment (OP-2).\n\n  - Protection system equipment in ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 24 \nProtection Outages, Settings and Coordination (OP-24).\n\nEach application for work involving the above areas shall be approved before any\nmaintenance, construction or test activity is conducted which would take equipment\nout-of-service or obviously impact the reliability of the power system. Some\nmaintenance, construction or test activities are routinely undertaken that do not\nrequire approval, when in the judgment of operations, maintenance, construction and\ntest personnel, these activities have a negligible reliability impact. These activities\ninclude preventive maintenance, construction, preparatory work for outages, routine\nmaintenance that can be accomplished with equipment on-line, equipment testing,\netc.\n\nHowever, if an abnormal condition exists or is anticipated and a maintenance,\nconstruction or test activity is planned, such as nuclear surveillance tests and/or\npreparatory work for a future equipment outage, an evaluation should be performed to\ndetermine if there is a reliability risk associated with the work to be performed. If an\nactivity cannot be stopped and/or postponed, operations, maintenance, construction\nand test personnel shall take precautions to prevent the on-going work from posing\nfurther risk to the reliability of the power system. This procedure provides guidelines\nfor M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert notification and for actions to be taken to limit\nrisk.\n\nThis procedure does not in any way affect the application of OP-2, OP-3, OP-5 or OP24. When an M/LCC 2 Alert notification occurs, the postponement, curtailment,\nrestoration (line), or resumption (Resource) of work approved under those procedures\nis to be considered on an individual basis by the ISO and/or the LCC.\n\nAn abnormal condition may affect the reliability of the entire New England Reliability\nCoordinator Area/Balancing Authority Area (RCA/BAA) or just a local reliability area.\nAn abnormal condition may be limited to a single Local Control Center (LCC).\nAccordingly, provision is made in this procedure for separate ISO M/LCC 2 Abnormal\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert Revision Number: 23.2 Revision Date: May 23, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\nConditions Alert and LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert notifications.\n\n# 4. Definition of an Abnormal Condition\n\nThe determination that an abnormal condition affecting the reliability of the power\nsystem exists or is anticipated is a decision made by the ISO Operations Shift\nSupervisor or the LCC System Operator. An abnormal condition exists when the\nreliability of the New England RCA/BAA is degraded. Typical indicators of an\nabnormal condition are:\n\n  - Forecasted or actual deficiency of Operating Reserves requiring implementation of\n\nOP-4 or OP-7\n\n  - Low transmission voltages and/or low reactive reserves\n\n  - Inability to provide first contingency protection when an undesirable post\ncontingency condition might result; e.g., Load Shedding\n\n  - Geomagnetic Disturbance\n\n  - A credible threat to power system reliability such as sabotage or an approaching\n\nstorm\n\n  - Operational staffing shortage impacting normal power system operations within\n\nNew England\n\n  - Cold Weather Event is declared\n\n  - Any other condition that may occur as determined by the ISO Operations Shift\n\nSupervisor or the LCC System Operator\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert Revision Number: 23.2 Revision Date: May 23, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\n# 5. Types of M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert Notifications\n\nFor the purposes of this procedure, two types of notifications shall be issued:\n\n**ISO M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert - This notice is issued when:**\n```\n   o An abnormal condition exists or is anticipated which affects the reliability of the\n\n```\nNew England RCA/BAA\n```\n   o An abnormal condition which affects the reliability of the power system exists or\n\n```\nis anticipated within one LCC and this condition could further degrade as a\nresult of a maintenance, construction or test activity and affect another LCC\n\n**LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert - This notice is issued when:**\n\nAn LCC M/LCC 2 Abnormal Conditions Alert shall be issued when an abnormal\ncondition which affects the reliability of the power system exists or is anticipated\nsolely within one LCC local reliability area and this condition would not become\nfurther degraded by the consequences of a maintenance, construction and/or test\nactivity in another LCC local reliability area\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2024|Master/LCC Procedure No. 2 - Abnormal Conditions Alert Revision Number: 23.2 Revision Date: May 23, 2024|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Manager, Control Room Operations|Approved by: M/LCC Heads|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\n# 6.

Objective\n\nThis procedure describes the various types of Nuclear Plant Interface Meetings (NPIMs).\nNPIMs are conducted to discuss matters affecting New England nuclear power stations.\nParticipants in NPIMs include ISO New England (ISO), applicable Local Control Centers\n(LCCs), Transmission Owners (TOs) and Nuclear Plant Generator Operators (NPGOPs) as\napplicable. This procedure also documents the responsibilities of ISO, LCCs, TOs and\nNPGOPs with regard to interacting with nuclear power stations. This procedure does not in\nany way change the intent of ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 3 - Transmission\nOutage Scheduling (OP-3) or ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 5 - Resource\nMaintenance and Outage Scheduling (OP-5) and other applicable ISO procedures pertaining\nto relays but rather is intended to clarify responsibilities of ISO, LCCs, TOs and NPGOPs\npertaining to NPIMs.\n\n## 2. Background\n\nThe types of NPIMs (which are described in more detail in Section 4) include:\n\n   - Weekly NPIMs\n\n   - Monthly NPIMs\n\n    - Quarterly NPIMs\n\n   - Executive NPIMs\n\n   - Natural Phenomena NPIMs\n\nThe LCCs, along with neighboring Reliability Coordinators, coordinate with ISO and submit\nproposed transmission outage requests, in accordance with OP-3, to ISO for logging and\nevaluation. Market Participants, including NPGOPs, submit their Generator outage requests\nto ISO for scheduling Maintenance Outages in accordance with OP-5. In addition to normal\ncommunication associated with dispatch and outage coordination, ISO has developed regular\ncommunication protocols with NPGOPs, LCCs and TOs to address potential concerns that\nmay affect the Bulk Electric System (BES) and the reliable operation and safe shutdown of\nnuclear power stations. Concern examples include, but are not limited to, tasks such as\nnuclear power station design changes, transmission system modifications or regulatory\nrequirement changes.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2023|Master/LCC Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations, Attachment E Revision Number: 7 Revision Date: May 23, 2023|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Andrew Kopacka, Supervisor Long-Term Outage Coordination|Approved by: M/LCC Heads and applicable M/LCC 1 Parties|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\n## 3.

This procedure contains provisions for\nthe NPGOP to be informed during abnormal system conditions so it can transfer\nstation loads to its auxiliary power sources in a timely fashion to facilitate safe\nshutdown of the nuclear plant.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2023|Master/LCC Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations Revision Number: Rev 20 Revision Date: May 23, 2023|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Andrew Kopacka, Supervisor, Long-Term Outage Coordination|Approved by: M/LCC Heads and applicable M/LCC 1 Parties|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\n# 2. Background\n\n**NOTE**\n\nPer the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Glossary of Terms\nUsed in NERC Reliability Standards, Nuclear Plant Interface Requirements (NPIRs)\nare: “The requirements based on NPLRs (Nuclear Plant Licensing Requirements)\nand Bulk Electric System (BES) requirements that have been mutually agreed to by\nthe Nuclear Plant Generator Operator (NPGOP) and the applicable Transmission\nEntities (TEs).” The NPGOP and TEs identified in Master/Local Control Center\nProcedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) Attachments C\nand D (in Section 10, Table 1 of each of these documents), are certain M/LCC 1\nParties that are each responsible for meeting one or more of the agreed-upon\nNPIRs. The NPIRs in these Tables apply to various functions performed by these\nTEs and/or the NPGOP, including Transmission Operator (TOP), Transmission\nPlanner (TP), Generator Operator (GOP) and Transmission Owner (TO). An\n“applicable LCC” or “applicable Other TE” referenced in this document is an LCC or\nTE that has agreed to one or more NPIRs pertinent to one or more nuclear power\nstations in New England.\n\nNERC Reliability Standard NUC-001 requires coordination between NPGOPs and\nTEs, for ensuring nuclear plant safe operation and shutdown. The TEs are each\nresponsible for providing services related to certain NPIRs. Each NPGOP is\nrequired to meet applicable NPIRs and to comply with Federal Regulations enforced\nby the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regarding safe\noperation of the nuclear power station. To comply, each nuclear power station\nrequires a reliable grid in which both nuclear plant access to designated sources of\noff-site power and the minimum voltage levels needed to operate station equipment\nare maintained, to allow safe shutdown of the plant.\n\nEffective communication among applicable NPGOPs, applicable LCCs and ISO is\nimperative to keep each nuclear power station operating within its design limits.\n\n\n-----\n\n|© ISO New England, Inc. 2023|Master/LCC Procedure No. 1 - Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations Revision Number: Rev 20 Revision Date: May 23, 2023|\n|---|---|\n|Owner: Andrew Kopacka, Supervisor, Long-Term Outage Coordination|Approved by: M/LCC Heads and applicable M/LCC 1 Parties|\n||Review Due Date: May 23, 2025|\n\n\n# 3.

The host Market\nParticipant or Transmission Owner (the Market Participant or Transmission Owner through which a\nnon-Market Participant and non-Transmission Owner connects to the PTF) shall use its best efforts to\nassure that, whenever it enters into arrangements with non-Market Participants and non-Transmission\nOwners, such arrangements are consistent with these standards.\n\nThese reliability standards establish minimum design criteria for the New England PTF. In addition to\nthese standards, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the Northeast Power\nCoordinating Council (NPCC) also have design criteria which may also apply to portions of the New\nEngland PTF. NERC and NPCC design criteria may be more stringent than what is contained in these\nstandards. Therefore, meeting the requirements set forth in this document does not assure that NERC\nand NPCC’s criteria have also been met. Similarly, there may be instances that these standards are\nmore stringent than the design criteria of NERC or NPCC and meeting the NERC or NPCC design\ncriteria does not meet these standards.\n\nThe New England PTF is required to be designed to meet the performance requirements for\nrepresentative contingencies as defined in these reliability standards. Analyses of these contingencies\nmay include assessment of the potential for the inability to meet the Nuclear Plant Interface\nRequirements (NPIRs). The NPIRs for each nuclear plant generator subject to dispatch by ISO New\nEngland Inc. (ISO) are documented in the Attachment to Master/Local Control Center Procedure No. 1\n\n- Nuclear Plant Transmission Operations (M/LCC 1) applicable to that nuclear plant generator.\n\nThe loss of minor portions of the transmission system may be tolerated provided the reliability of the\noverall interconnected transmission system is not jeopardized and the NPIRs are met.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP3 – Reliability Standards for the\nNew England Area Pool Transmission Facilities\n\n**2.** **SECTION 2**\n\n(This section intentionally left blank)\n\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP3 – Reliability Standards for the\nNew England Area Pool Transmission Facilities\n\n**3.** **PTF TRANSMISSION REQUIREMENTS**\n\nThe New England PTF shall be designed with sufficient transmission capacity to serve Area loads and\nmeet the applicable NPIRs for the contingency events noted below. The contingencies shall be applied\nto transmission elements and generating resources in order to examine the potential for the inability to\nmeet the performance criteria as defined in this procedure on the New England PTF. Contingencies\nlisted in Table 1 and Table 2 below that are expected to produce more severe impacts on the PTF shall\nbe evaluated for system performance. The design shall assume power flow conditions with applicable\ntransfers, loads, and resource conditions that reasonably stress the system.\n\nIn applying these criteria, it is recognized that it may be necessary to restrict the output of resources\nfollowing the loss of a system element. This may be necessary to maintain system reliability in the\nevent of a subsequent outage.\n\nRemedial Action Schemes/Automatic Control Schemes (RAS/ACS) may be employed in the design of\nthe interconnected power system. The addition, modification or retirement of a RAS/ACS on the New\nEngland Transmission System must be reviewed by the Reliability Committee and approved by ISO\nNew England. For a RAS, such changes may also require review and approval by NPCC.\n\nConditions required for the design of the transmission system can be classified as:\n\nN-0: All-facilities-in\nN-1: All-facilities-in followed by a contingency\nN-1-1: Scenarios that have contingency while a single element is out of service. After removal\nof the single element from service, system adjustments are made in preparation for the next\ncontingency. These adjustments[1] can consist of any combination of the following:\n\na. Increasing resources available within ten minutes following notification\nb. Adjustments that can be achieved in thirty minutes such as:\n\n        - Generator runback and/or generator tripping\n\n        - Reducing transfers on HVDC facilities\n\n        - Adjusting phase angle regulators, transformer load tap changers, and variable\nreactors\n\n        - Switching series and shunt capacitors and reactors.\n\n        - Reducing imports from external Areas.\n\nThe contingencies and the performance requirements for each condition are listed in Table 1 and Table\n2 below.\n\n1 Total increase in resource adjustment must not exceed 1,200 MW.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP3 – Reliability Standards for the\nNew England Area Pool Transmission Facilities\n\n**Table 1: N-1** **[2]**\n\n**Performance Requirements** **[3]**\n\n**Initial Condition** **Event**\n\n**Steady-State** **Stability** **[4]**\n\nAll Facilities-In 1.0 No contingency PTF facilities shall have The system shall remain in a state\n\nequipment loadings within normal of equilibrium.\nlimits.\n\nPTF voltages shall be within\nnormal limits.\n\nAll NPIRs shall be met.\n\n1.1 Permanent three phase fault with normal PTF facilities shall have The system shall remain stable.\nfault clearing on a: equipment loadings within Cascading and uncontrollable\n\n              - Generator applicable emergency limits for islanding that result in the loss or\n\nthe system conditions that exist unintentional separation of major\n\n              - Transmission Circuit\n\nfollowing the contingency portions of the PTF transmission\n\n              - Transformer\n\nsystem shall not occur.\n\n              - Bus Section\n\nPTF voltages shall be within\n\n              - Shunt Device\n\napplicable emergency limits for Individual generating units ≥ 5\n\n1.2 Simultaneous permanent phase-to-ground the system conditions that exist MW[5] shall not lose synchronism\nfaults on different phases of each of two\n\nfollowing the contingency or trip.\n\nadjacent transmission circuits on a multiple\n\n2 As described in Section 1 of this Planning Procedure, NERC and NPCC design criteria may be more stringent that what is contained in\nthese standards.

System damping is characterized by the damping ratio, zeta (ζ). The damping ratio provides\nan indication of the length of time an oscillation will take to dampen. The damping criterion specifies\na minimum damping ratio of 0.03, which corresponds to a 1% settling time of one minute or less for all\noscillations with a frequency of 0.4 Hz or higher. Conformance with the criterion may be\ndemonstrated with the use of small signal eigenvalue analysis to explicitly identify the damping ratio\nof all questionable oscillations.\n\nTime domain analysis may also be utilized to determine acceptable system damping. Acceptable\ndamping with time domain analysis requires running a transient stability simulation for sufficient time\n(up to 30 seconds) such that only a single mode of oscillation remains. A 53% reduction in the\nmagnitude of the oscillation must then be observed over four periods of the oscillation, measuring from\nthe point where only a single mode of oscillation remains in the simulation.\n\nAs an alternate method, the time domain response of system state quantities such as generator rotor\nangle, voltage, and interface transfers can be transformed into the frequency domain where the\ndamping ratio can be calculated.\n\nA sufficient number of system state quantities including rotor angle, voltage, and interface transfers\nshould be analyzed to ensure that adequate system damping is observed.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP3 – Reliability Standards for the\nNew England Area Pool Transmission Facilities\n\n**APPENDIX \"D\" Transient Voltage Criterion**\n\nTransient Voltage Response: The voltage at all the PTF buses that serve load or buses that are\nconnected to load-serving transformers shall not stay below 0.8 p.u. for longer than 10 seconds from\nfault inception.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nISO New England Planning Procedure PP3 – Reliability Standards for the\nNew England Area Pool Transmission Facilities\n\n**APPENDIX \"E\" Determining Acceptability of Source Loss**\n\nThe following flowchart is intended to clarify the performance requirements regarding source loss\ncontained in Tables 1 and 2.

(ISO) with advisory input from the Reliability\nCommittee (RC) will determine whether there are Localized Costs to be excluded from\nPool-Supported PTF revenue requirements.\n\nThis Planning Procedure provides guidance on: what Projects are subject to cost review;\nwhat information the applicant for cost review (the Applicant) must provide to the ISO; the\nprocess for RC and ISO review of an Applicant’s Project; the factors that will be considered\nin determining whether there are Localized Costs associated with a Project; and the\nperiodic reporting of costs associated with a Project by the Applicant.\n\nThis Planning Procedure also provides an Applicant with guidelines for preparing a\nTransmission Cost Allocation (TCA) application (TCA Application) for use by the ISO\nand the RC. The Applicant must support the TCA Application with the necessary\ninformation and analysis of the Project. This procedure provides guidance on what\ninformation and analysis is to be supplied in support a TCA Application. The submittal of\na completed TCA Application form provided in Attachment B – TCA Form (Attachment\nB)[5] to this Procedure and any supporting materials describing and assessing the impact of\nthe proposed Project together shall constitute submittal of a TCA Application.\n\n1 Capitalized terms used in this Procedure are intended to have the same meaning given to such terms in\nSection I.2.2 of the Tariff.\n2 For the purposes of this Planning Procedure, a Project is a plan, program, or grouping of Transmission\nUpgrades as they are identified in the RSP Project List or the Asset Condition Project List as a single\nproject.\n3 As defined in Section I.2.2 of the Tariff, an RBU is a Transmission Upgrade that: is rated 115 kV or\nabove; meets all of the non-voltage criteria for PTF classification specified in the OATT; and is included in\nthe Regional System Plan as either a Reliability Transmission Upgrade or an Market Efficiency\nTransmission Upgrade.\n4 As defined in Section I.2.2 of the Tariff, a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade is an addition and/or\nupgrade to the New England Transmission System that meets the voltage and non-voltage criteria for\nPublic Policy Transmission Upgrade PTF classification specified in the OATT, and has been included in\nthe Regional System Plan and RSP Project List as a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade pursuant to the\nprocedures described in Section 4A of Attachment K of the OATT.\n5 [http://www.iso-ne.com/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp04_0/pp4_0_attachment_b.xls](http://www.iso-ne.com/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp04_0/pp4_0_attachment_b.xls)\n\n-2\nISO-NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nApproval of a TCA Application by the ISO informs an Applicant of the approved Project\ncosts that may be included in Pool-Supported PTF revenue requirements subject to the\nterms and conditions in the OATT. An ISO finding of Localized Costs does not prohibit\nan Applicant from recovering such expenditures elsewhere in the OATT.\n\nThis Planning Procedure shall be submitted to the review of the RC, no less than every five\nyears or at the request of the RC, to evaluate the appropriateness of the minimum threshold\nset out in section 1.1.2 of this Planning Procedure.\n\n1.1 Projects Requiring a TCA Application\n\n1.1.1. Categories of Projects requiring TCA Application\n\nTCA Applications are required for the following types of Projects that are\nseeking regional cost support:\n\n(1) an RBU identified in the Regional System Plan or Regional System Plan\n\nProject List (including those selected as part of the Competitive\nSolutions Process);\n\n(2) one or more plans that otherwise require submittal for review under\n\nTariff Section I.3.9 and that address the same system need as an RBU\nas identified in the Regional System Plan or Regional System Plan\nProject list;\n\n(3) reconstruction/replacement of PTF that does not require approval under\n\nTariff Section I.3.9 but that has a total estimated PTF portion of the\nProject cost greater than or equal to $5 Million;\n\n(4) a Public Policy Transmission Upgrade identified in the Regional System\n\nPlan or Regional System Plan Project List;\n\n(5) an Asset Condition Project[6] identified in the Asset Condition Project\n\nList (as further described in Attachment G)\n\nAlthough the Project may be projected over any time frame to demonstrate\nprudent planning, action on TCA Applications will only be taken on plans\n\n6 For more details on requirements for asset condition projects, see the Section 6.3 of the Transmission\nPlanning Process Guide:\n[https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2022/11/transmission_planning_process_guide.pdf](https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2022/11/transmission_planning_process_guide.pdf)\n\n-3\nISO-NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nthat have begun construction or are expected to begin construction no later\nthan five (5) years after the date of the TCA Application submittal.\n\nGenerally, an Applicant must file a single TCA Application for its Project,[7]\nas identified in the Regional System Plan or Asset Condition List. The ISO\nmay, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, allow multiple TCA\nApplications for individual components of a single Project. The Applicant\nmust discuss their intent with the ISO prior to submitting multiple\napplications for different components of a single Project.\n\nA TCA Application must be submitted to recover qualified, incurred PTF\nexpenditures on a Project identified in this Section 1.1.1. that has been\ncancelled by the ISO. Costs associated with such a project will be reviewed\nin accordance with Schedule 12C, as applicable.\n\n1.1.2. Exemptions from TCA Application Requirements\n\nIf a Project is not identified in Section 1.1.1 above, or if the total estimated\nPTF portion of the Project cost is less than $5,000,000,[8] then the Applicant\ndoes not need to file a TCA Application unless the actual costs exceed\n$5,000,000. The ISO may request that a TCA Application be submitted for\nProjects that are less than $5,000,000 if the potential for significant\nlocalized costs (as described in Attachment A) exists.\n\n1.1.3. Projects not subject to this Procedure\n\nThis Review Process does not pertain to:\n\n1. Schedule 11 of Section II of the Tariff, Category C Generator\n\nInterconnection Related Upgrades (GIRUs);\n\n2. Elective Transmission Upgrades;\n3. Local Benefit Upgrades;\n4. Recovery of Localized Costs; and\n5. Merchant Transmission Facilities or their interconnection.\n\n1.2 Guidance for completion of TCA Application and Supporting Materials\n\n7 Determination on a Project will only be made once all parts of the Project (no matter if it is from one\nApplicant or multiple) have been presented and acted upon by the RC.\n8 When a Project’s cost is over the minimum TCA threshold, a TCA(s) must be submitted for all\ncomponents that make up the Project for ISO and RC review, even if the estimated costs are less than $5M\nfor an individual component.\n\n-4\nISO-NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nThe complexity of proposed changes to the transmission system can range\nfrom minor changes to major alterations. The intent of the PP4 process is\nto match information required as part of a TCA Application, to the review\neffort, and relative cost of the Project. Section 1.5 below provides guidance\nas to the level of information required in a TCA Application. The TCA\nApplication, and any supporting documents, shall also reflect the cost\ninformation as illustrated in Appendix D – Project Cost Estimating\nGuidelines.[9] The Applicant may request further guidance or preliminary\nreview of Project-related information from the ISO and the RC prior to\nsubmitting a formal TCA Application.\n\n1.3 Special Consideration of Submitted Materials\n\nShould any documentation be submitted that is considered confidential by\nthe Applicant, it is the responsibility of the Applicant to describe to the ISO,\nby name, the documents to be considered confidential. All information\nmarked as confidential will be controlled in accordance with the ISO New\nEngland Information Policy.\n\nDocuments submitted that contain Critical Energy Infrastructure\nInformation (CEII) materials, as deemed by the Applicant, should be noted\nas such and will be posted appropriately. To the extent possible, TCA\nmaterials provided for review should be void of CEII materials.\n\nDue to the nature of Projects that are required to comply with [NERC](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-014-2.pdf)\n[Reliability Standard CIP-014 - Physical Security (CIP-014),[10] the Applicant](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP-014-2.pdf)\nshall submit to ISO un-redacted and redacted versions of the completed\nTCA Application and supporting materials. The un-redacted version shall\nbe used by ISO for its review and determination. The redacted version of\nthe Application and supporting materials[11] shall exclude sensitive\ninformation, including the name of the substation(s) where upgrades are\noccurring, as release of this information represents a severe reliability threat\nto the transmission system. This redacted version shall be provided by ISO\nto the RC for its review and action.\n\nThe redacted TCA Application will automatically be created when the\nApplicant inputs information in the TCA Application form, Attachment B\n\n9 https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/rules_proceds/isone_plan/pp04_0/pp4_0_attachment_d.pdf\n10 The purpose of CIP-014 is “to identify and protect Transmission stations and Transmission substations,\nand their associated primary control centers, that if rendered inoperable or damaged as a result of a physical\nattack could result in instability, uncontrolled separation, or Cascading within an Interconnection.”\n11 The redacted version shall mask information that is considered more sensitive than that which is CEII\nand therefore cannot be viewed by those individuals who are approved to receive CEII materials.\n\n-5\nISO-NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nto this PP4. This functionality will provide for a consistent CIP-014 TCA\nApplication across all Applicants.\n\n1.4 Roles of PAC, RC and ISO in TCA Application Review Process\n\n1.4.1 In advance of the submittal of a completed TCA Application, the\nPlanning Advisory Committee (PAC) shall review proposed solutions and\nmay offer advisory input to the ISO as to the most cost effective and\nreliable solutions for the region that meet a need identified in a Needs\nAssessment through the Regional System Planning Process. This\ninformation will be used by the Project proponent (i.e., Transmission\nOwner) at a later date when developing a TCA Application.\n\n1.4.2 The RC, or its designee, will review TCA Applications and the RC\nwill make an advisory recommendation to the ISO as to whether there are\nLocalized Costs associated with the Project that should not be supported as\nPool-Supported PTF costs. Localized Costs will be identified by the RC\nbased on the rules for PTF determination as defined in Attachment F of the\nTariff and section 1.6.2 of this procedure.\n\n1.4.3 The ISO will consider the RC’s advisory recommendation in\nmaking its determination of whether there are Localized Costs associated\nwith the Project that should not be included as Pool-Supported PTF costs.\n\n1.4.4 The Applicant of Category 4 or 5 TCA Application (as identified in\nSection 1.5, Table 1, of this Procedure) must provide an update each year\nfollowing the completed TCA submittal, until the project is complete and\nin-service, to the ISO and RC with regard to construction progress and costs.\nIn addition, the Applicant may be asked by the ISO to provide a Project\nupdate to the PAC. A PAC update will utilize the forms in Attachment D\nof this procedure. An Applicant will not be asked to update the PAC more\nthan three times in a calendar year regarding the status of a Project,\nregardless if the Project has one or several TCA’s associated with it. The\nfinal cost update shall include the actual, completed cost of the Project.\n\n1.5 Evaluation\n\nBased on the total estimated PTF portion of the cost of the Project, five (5)\ncategories of analysis are identified in Table 1 below for supporting a\nparticular Project (ranging from no analysis for exempt Projects to full costs\nanalyses of transmission alternatives). The ISO and/or the RC may also,\nhowever, request that the Applicant provide additional information in\nsupport of the TCA Application. The analysis categories are summarized as\nfollows:\n\n-6\nISO-NE Public\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n\n**Table 1**\n\n-7\n|Category|Total Estimated or actual Portion of the Project Cost for Which Regional Rate Treatment is Sought|Documentation Detail Required (in accordance with Section 1.6.1 of this PP4) [Note: The ISO and/or RC may request additional information]|Draft TCA Application to ISO-NE for Preliminary Review|Timeline for Submission of TCA Application for Action by the RC|RC Action|ISO Action|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Less than $5,000,000|TCA Application is not required unless it is part of a larger Project with a total project cost for which regional rate treatment is sought of greater than $5,000,000.

The timelines provided in this PP4 are intended to provide\nguidance to the Applicant, the RC and the ISO but do not bind the RC or\nthe ISO to take any action.\n\nThe TCA Application for a Project, or individual components as provided\nunder Section 1.1.1 above, will be submitted to the ISO prior to the start of\nMajor Construction. If the Applicant determines that a TCA cannot be\nsubmitted before Major Construction commences, the Applicant will provide\nto the RC a project and preliminary cost update within six months after that\ndetermination and thereafter at least annually. The TCA shall be submitted\nbefore the start of Major Construction for the final element of the Project.\n\nMajor Construction means that all major permits are issued, major contracts\nsecured and either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure\non a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the\nconstruction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the\nplacement of manufactured equipment on a foundation. Major construction\ndoes not include land preparation activities, such as clearing, grading,\ninstallation of access or any excavation nor does it include the erection of\ntemporary structures or the installation on the property of accessory buildings,\nsuch as garages or work trailers that are not part of the main structure.\n\nIn a Force Majeure or Emergency event TCA Application(s) may be submitted\nafter a Project is placed into service but should be submitted to the ISO no later\nthan one year after a Project is placed into service.\n\n1.6.1 Review of a completed TCA Application by ISO and the RC\n\nAn Applicant is encouraged to discuss their completed TCA Application\nand supporting documentation with the ISO to ensure completeness prior to\nsubmittal for review.\n\nA completed TCA Application, and supporting documentation, shall be\nsubmitted electronically to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C to this\nProcedure), who will collect, distribute, and provide a permanent record of\nthe TCA Application.\n\nUpon receipt and review of a TCA Application, the ISO will notify the\nApplicant if the submitted TCA Application is incomplete or additional\ninformation is required.\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nA typical completed TCA Application will include the following:\n\n(a) Cover Letter (including when action by the RC is requested);\n(b) Completed TCA Application form (Attachment B); and\n(c) Additional details and supporting documentation pertaining to:\n\n1) A review and discussion of the need for the proposed Project.\n\n          - Note: To the extent that the needs analysis was conducted\n\nduring the planning process (i.e., Regional System Plan (RSP)),\na summary of that analysis may be considered sufficient.\n\n2) A summary of the technical analysis performed for the Project and\n\nthe identified transmission alternatives.\n\n3) A discussion of why the Project was selected over other\n\ntransmission alternatives, with a description of the benefits of the\nproposed Project over other transmission alternatives from an\noperational, timing of implementation, cost and reliability\nperspective.\n\n(i) The proposed Project, and any feasible and practical\n\ntransmission alternatives that were considered, including those\noffered in the most recent RSP report and, if applicable,\ndiscussed at the PAC.\n\nNote: A feasible and practical transmission alternative means\na transmission alternative that is feasible and practical from\nan engineering design and construction perspective. An\nalternative that is not or may not be approved by a siting or\nlocal review board may still be considered a feasible and\npractical transmission alternative.\n\n(ii) The most currently available cost estimates[14] of building the\n\nProject and, if required, transmission alternatives that were\nconsidered, including overall costs and categorized as identified\nin Attachment D of this procedure.[15];\n\n(iii)A comparison of the potential operational impacts on the bulk\n\npower system during construction of the Project with any\nfeasible and practical transmission alternatives that were\nconsidered;\n\n(iv)A comparison of the potential operating costs of the Project and\n\nany feasible and practical transmission alternatives that were\nconsidered; and\n\n(v) Design considerations affecting maintenance, construction\n\nand/or future expansion of the Project.\n\n14 All dollar amounts shall be expressed in year of expenditure dollars and based on the project anticipated\nschedule. Escalation shall be included and be clearly identified with the assumption stated (escalation rate\napplied to the project). Alternatives and preferred Project shall be stated in the same valuation year.\n15 For each categorization of costs, year incurred shall be identified.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n(d) Before and after one-line diagrams and a map locating the facilities[16].\n(e) Correlation Table which identifies the project driver, RSP or ACL\n\nProject ID, including sub-components, Proposed Plan Applications and\nrelevant TCA Application description/costs as shown in Attachment E\nto this Planning Procedure\n\n(f) Any additional relevant information requested by the ISO or the RC.\n\nThe Applicant has an ongoing responsibility to update any TCA Application\nwhen additional information relevant to review of the TCA Application\nbecomes available prior to RC review and issuance of the ISO’s written\nfindings and determination.\n\n1.6.2 Considerations\n\n1.6.2.1 In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for\nProjects that are not developed through the competitive transmission\nprocess pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4A of Attachment K (except for\nProjects, as described in Section 1.6.2.2, that are located on a PTO’s existing\ntransmission system, where the Selected Qualified Transmission Project\nSponsor is not the PTO for the existing system element(s)), the ISO, with\nadvisory input from the RC, will consider the reasonableness of the\nproposed design and construction method with respect to:\n\n(a) Good Utility Practice;\n(b) Current engineering design and construction practices in the area in\n\nwhich the Project is proposed to be built/is being built;\n\n(c) Allowance for appropriate expansion and load growth;\n(d) Alternate feasible and practical transmission alternatives; and\n(e) The relative costs, operation, efficiency, reliability and timing of\n\nimplementation of the proposed Project.\n\nAttachment A to this Procedure provides examples of relevant\nconsiderations for determination of Localized Costs.\n\n1.6.2.2 In making its determination of whether Localized Costs exist for a\nproject developed through the competitive transmission solutions process\npursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4A of Attachment K, the ISO with advisory\ninput from the RC, will consider the Project described in Schedule A to the\nSelected Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor Agreement compared to\nwhat is submitted in the Transmission Cost Allocation application for\nregional rate recovery. Localized Costs for the Transmission Upgrades\nidentified in the Project that are located on a PTO’s existing transmission\nsystem, where the Selected Qualified Transmission Project Sponsor is not\nthe PTO for the existing system element(s), will be determined in a manner\n\n16 If these documents were already submitted to the ISO as part of a Proposed Plan Application, they do not\nneed to be re-submitted.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nconsistent with the process described for the Transmission Upgrades\nidentified in Section 1.6.2.1 above.\n\n1.6.3 Additional Costs Due to Regulatory or Public Requirements\n\nThe Applicant shall identify in their TCA Application any additional\nproposed Pool-Supported PTF costs introduced as a result of local or state\nregulatory and/or legislative requirements. The ISO will then determine,\nwith the advice of the RC, whether these incremental costs resulting from\nthe requirements of any local or state regulatory and/or legislative\nrequirements will be identified as Localized Costs.\n\nIf the Applicant has received an advisory vote from the RC on a TCA\nApplication, and has not begun or completed the siting process, the\nApplicant is required to provide periodic updates to both the RC and the\nISO on those proceedings and a presentation on the final design of the\nProject. If, after siting is complete, there is a major design change and/or\nchanges to the Project that could result in Localized Costs, the Applicant\nshall report the design change to both the RC and the ISO and discuss with\nthe ISO whether the change requires that the Applicant submit an amended\nTCA Application.\n\n1.7 Time Guidelines\n\nApplicants are urged to supply the completed TCA Application and\nsupporting data, with adequate lead times for anticipated review by the RC\nand ISO as described in Sections 1.5 and 1.6 above.  Failure to follow these\ntimeframes may result in a delay of review of the TCA Application.\n\n1.8 Actions on a TCA Application\n\n1.8.1 RC Review and Action\n\nAt the request of the Applicant, the ISO will forward a submitted TCA and\nsupporting materials to the RC for its review and action. The ISO shall also\ninclude a draft motion for the RC to consider when taking action on any\nadvisory input related to the determination of whether any costs associated\nwith such upgrade are Localized Costs\n\nOn each submitted TCA Application, the RC will provide a\nrecommendation and act upon a motion describing the identification and\nconditions of treatment of Localized costs, if any, associated with the\nProject.\n\nIf in reviewing the TCA Application, the RC decides additional\ninformation, review, or study is required prior to acting on the Application,\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nthe RC may elect to defer action and solicit supplementary information,\nreview, or study as required.\n\nTherefore, the RC may defer action, determine that no Localized Costs have\nbeen identified by the RC and recommend approval of the TCA Application\nby the ISO, or recommend a determination of Localized Costs by the ISO.\n\nIf the Applicant seeks advisory input by the Participants Committee, it may\nrequest TCA Application review by the Participants Committee after the\nRC meeting but before the fifth (5[th]) business day following a meeting of\nthe RC. The request for Participants Committee review and advisory input\nshall be submitted in writing by the Applicant to the Secretary of the RC\nwith a copy sent to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C).\n\n1.8.1 ISO Review and Determination\n\nThe ISO will consider the recommendations of the RC, and the Participants\nCommittee as appropriate, in the process of making a determination on each\nTCA Application. The ISO may also seek additional information from the\nApplicant before or after RC or Participants Committee action but prior to\nmaking its decision. The ISO will transmit, in a timely manner, its written\nfindings, the basis for its decision, and is determination as to whether the\nsubmitted TCA Application contains any associated Localized Costs to the\nApplicant (with copy to the RC).\n\nFor a Category 5 TCA Application (as shown in Table 1) the ISO will issue\na draft determination letter that will be posted on the ISO’s website[17] for a\n30 day comment period. During the comment period the Applicant or any\ninterested Stakeholder may send written comments to the ISO regarding the\nISO’s determination decision. After the comment period has ended the\ncomments will be reviewed and the ISO will issue a final determination on\nthe TCA Application.\n\nIf the Applicant disagrees with the ISO’s written findings and\ndetermination, the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 1.11\nbelow shall be followed.\n\n1.9 Withdrawal of a TCA Application\n\nShould an Applicant wish to withdraw or terminate its TCA Application,\n(either before or after determination action has been taken by the ISO) it\nshall send a letter to that effect to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment C).\nThe ISO will distribute the notice of withdrawal to the RC.\n\n17 [https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/transmission-cost-allocation/](https://www.iso-ne.com/system-planning/transmission-planning/transmission-cost-allocation/)\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n    - Where a Proposed Plan Application was not required, but a TCA\n\nApplication was submitted, the ISO issued a written findings and\ndetermination and the Project was cancelled, the TCA Applicant must\nprovide written notification to ISO within 60-days of such cancellation,\nrequesting withdrawal of the approved TCA Application.\n\n    - Where a Proposed Plan Application was required, and a TCA\n\nApplication was submitted, the ISO issued a written findings and\ndetermination and the Project was cancelled, the TCA Application will\nautomatically be withdrawn upon notification of withdrawal of the\nProposed Plan Application.\n\n    - If a Project is canceled by the ISO, and regardless of whether a Proposed\n\nPlan Application was required, an Applicant must submit a TCA\nApplication for costs that were incurred prior to cancellation of the\nProject if the Applicant seeks to recover those costs through the RNS\nrate.\n\n1.10 Reviews and Update of Approved TCA Applications\n\nThe RC and the ISO will review an updated TCA Application for the\nproposed Project, as described below.\n\nThe Applicant is responsible to inform the ISO of any significant additional\nPool-Supported PTF costs or any material changes in the design associated\nwith a proposed Project made subsequent to approval of the TCA\nApplication. Such information shall be delivered to the ISO by submitting\na revised TCA Application, including the reasons for resubmission in\naccordance with the template of Attachment D. Specifically, an Applicant,\nwhich has already received approval of its original TCA Application, must\nnotify both the RC and the ISO if either: (i) costs have exceeded or are\nanticipated to exceed 10% of the amount determined by the ISO to be\nincluded in Pool-Supported PTF costs; (ii) costs have decreased or are\nanticipated to decrease by 10% of the amount determined by the ISO to be\nincluded in Pool-Supported PTF costs; or (iii) there is a material change in\ndesign of the Project. In the case that Pool-Supported PTF costs have\ndecreased by 10% or more, a revised TCA application does not need to be\nfiled but information must be provided to the ISO and RC, in a timely\nmanner, using the templates in Attachment D which identify and explain\ncost variance to the original TCA estimate. If an Applicant fails to notify\nthe ISO of any of these developments, and it is discovered, such as during\nan audit, then the costs associated with such development will be excluded\nfrom the Pool-Supported PTF until the process described in this Procedure\nhas been followed and the ISO accepts the costs following appropriate\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nreview by the RC and the ISO. In such instance, the costs shall be recovered\nonly prospectively pursuant to the Tariff.\n\n1.11 Dispute Resolution\n\nShould the Applicant disagree with the ISO’s written findings and\ndetermination as described in Section 1.8 above, a dispute may be filed.\n\nAs stated in Section 3 of Schedule 12C to the OATT, disputes shall be\nsubmitted in a formal written notice to the ISO (as detailed in Attachment\nC). Such notice shall describe in detail the basis for challenging the ISO’s\nwritten findings and determination, and must be submitted within 60 days\nof receipt of the ISO’s written findings and determination. The Applicant\nand the ISO will then enter into good faith negotiations for a period not to\nexceed 60 days from the date of the Applicant’s written notice to try to\nresolve the dispute. If there is no resolution of the dispute at the end of the\nnegotiation period, the Applicant may file a Section 206 complaint with the\nCommission.\n\nThe ISO shall notify the RC of the outcome of the dispute resolution\nprocess.\n\n2.0 TCA Application Forms\n\n2.1. Completed TCA Application Content\n\nA completed form of TCA Application in Attachment B must be submitted\nwith each TCA Application as outlined in Section 1.6 above. Any included\nsupporting documentation should supplement the TCA Application.\n\n2.2 TCA Application Identification\n\nApplication Number (Company – Calendar Year (2 digits) – TCA– Unique\nID (Sequential TCA Application #’s) – Rev #\n\ne.g. CMP-04-TCA-01\nCMP-04-TCA-02\n\nCMP-04-TCA-01-Rev 1\n\n3.0 Attachment C – ISO Correspondence\n\nThe ISO may, per this Procedure, update Attachment C in regard to the\nmechanisms for exchange of correspondence, without RC approval. The\nISO will notify the RC when such a change has been made.\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n**Document History[18]**\n\nRev. 0 App.: 4/17/98\nRev. 1 Rec.: RC – 5/19/04; Eff.: PC – 6/11/04\nRev. 2 Eff: 2/1/05\nRev. 3 Rec.: RC – 12/6/06; Eff.: PC – 1/5/07\nRev. 4 Rec.: RC – 7/21/09; PC – 8/7/09; ISO-NE 8/7/09\nRev. 5 Rec.: RC- 8/17/2010; PC – 9/17/2010; ISO-NE 9/17/2010\nRev. 6 REC: RC – 8/11/2014; PC - 9/12/2014; ISO-NE 9/12/2014\nRev. 7 REC: RC – 4/19/2016; PC - 5/6/2016; ISO-NE 5/6/2016\nRev. 8 REC: RC – 6/20/2017; PC - 6/27/2017; ISO-NE 7/7/2017 – revised for CIP-14 additions\nRev. 9 REC: RC – 8/24/2017; PC - 9/15/2017 (60.1%); ISO-NE 9/28/2017 – revised Attachment A\nRev. 10 REC: RC – 5/15/2018; PC - 6/1/2018; ISO-NE 6/12/2018 – addition of Attachment G\nRev. 11 REC: RC – 11/14/2018; PC -12/7/2018; ISO-NE 12/20/2018 – addition of Attachment H\nRev. 12 REC: RC – 12/18/2019; PC -2/6/2020; ISO-NE 2/6/2020– Localized Costs Definition change\nadditions\nRev. 13 REC: RC – 1/20/2021; PC -2/4/2021; ISO-NE 2/4/2021– Updates to Section 1.6 as required by\nDocket No. EL16-19-000\nRev. 14 REC: RC – 8/15/2023; PC – 9/7/2023; ISO-NE - 9/7/2023 –updated Attachments G and H.\nGeneral cleanup of PP4, Attachment D and other supporting documents.\n\n18 This Document History documents action taken on the equivalent NEPOOL/ISO New England\nProcedure prior to the RTO Operations Date as well as revisions to the ISO New England Procedure\nsubsequent to the RTO Operations Date.\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n**Attachment A**\n\n**Supplemental Guidelines for Pool-Supported PTF Cost Review**\n\nIn determining whether there are Localized Costs, the ISO will consider as appropriate and\nwith the advisory input of the RC, the following non-exclusive list of factors:\n\n1. Costs of construction including all costs associated with rights of way,\n\neasements and associated real estate.\n\n2. Assessment of the schedule or in-service date of the Project from an engineering\n\nand construction standpoint rather than from the standpoint of potential delays\nin local or state siting.\n\n3. Relative reliability and operational impacts of the Project as compared to\n\nalternatives considered.\n\n4. Costs associated with operation and maintenance of the proposed design and\n\nalternatives, including consideration of whether the proposed design is\nconsistent with Good Utility Practice.\n\n5. Costs of related and long-term congestion impacts, if any, of each proposed\n\nPTF and Non-PTF design alternative, including costs related to outages\nassociated with construction.\n\n6. The proposed design’s fit into reasonable future expansion plans, including the\n\nRegional System Plan.\n\n7. Consistency with current engineering, design and construction practices in the\n\narea.\n\nThe following, non-exclusive list of examples is provided for illustration of the types of\nProjects that would be considered to contain Localized Costs:\n\n1. The Project costs more than a feasible or practical transmission alternative and\n\nhas equal or less robust bulk power system performance than the transmission\nalternative.\n\n2. A Reliability Transmission Upgrade (excluding Asset Condition and\n\nreconstruction/ replacement Projects) that does not address a need identified in\na Needs Assessment through the Regional System Planning Process.\n\n3. The Project includes one or more underground transmission cables, which is\n\nselected (a) at the direction of a local or state siting board or (b) to address other\nlocal concerns, and the cost of overhead transmission lines is less expensive,\ntaking into account all relevant costs.\n\n4. The Project is a gas-insulated or covered substation when an open-air substation\n\nwould be feasible and practical for lower cost.\n\n5. Installation of one or more Independent Pole Tripping breakers at a substation\n\noperating at less than 345 kV without a stability need.\n\n6. The Project includes spare equipment or spare conduits.\n7. Costs associated with local or state siting board initiated visual mitigation that\n\ngo beyond Good Utility Practice.\n\n8. The Project includes construction in a flood hazard area that exceeds the\n\nAttachment H recommendation to this planning procedure.\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nThe following, non-exclusive list of examples is provided for illustration of the types of\nProjects that are not likely to contain Localized Costs.\n\n1. The Project includes one or more underground transmission cables but the total\n\ncost of the underground transmission cable Project is lower than a feasible and\npractical overhead transmission line, the operating and maintenance costs are\ncomparable, and the reliability benefits provided by the underground cable are\nequal to or better than those provided by the overhead line.\n\n2. The Project has higher total cost than feasible and practical transmission\n\nalternatives, but provides for more robust bulk power system performance\nconsistent with the Regional System Plan planning horizon and predicted load\ngrowth when compared to such transmission alternatives.\n\n3.

Providing answers to the following question within a completed TCA\nApplication will aid the RC and ISO in the rendering of a Localized Cost determination.\n\n- Explaining if there were any cost “adders” (elements of the Project not directly related to\n\nelectrical facilities such as park land, trees, bike paths, etc) to the proposed Project that\n\nwere not directly related to the electrical facilities.\n\n- Providing a complete explanation for the choice of transmission line construction design\n\n(i.e. mono-pole vs. H-frame or underground vs. overhead).as\n\n- Providing a cost breakdown of the per-mile cost of the transmission line (overhead or\n\nunderground).\n\n- Describe any local or state siting issues or requirements.\n\n- Describe any construction and/or design challenges that were encountered or are\n\nanticipated to be encountered for the proposed project.\n\n- Describing any differences between the proposed Project as described in the TCA\n\nApplication and what is described in the most recent RSP.\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n**Attachment G**\n\n**Guidance for Submission of TCA Applications for Asset Condition Projects**\n\nIn support of Section 1.1.1(5) of PP4, this guideline shall be utilized by asset owners for the\npurpose of determining when (i) a Transmission Cost Allocation application submittal is\nrequired and (ii) a supporting PAC presentation is required for Asset Condition Projects,\nwhich are projects identified in the Asset Condition Project List that have estimated or\nactual PTF costs that are greater than or equal to $5M for a specific need. The entire\nprocess can be seen in the flowchart below.\n\n**Asset Condition Project Categories and examples:**\n\n**1.** **For the purpose of this Attachment G, Asset Condition Projects may be**\n\n**categorized as follows:**\n\n  - A substation project is defined as “work done inside the fence” with an expected\n\nPTF cost greater than or equal to $5M for a specified need over the course of a 5\nyear period or less.\n\n  - A line project is defined as work being done on each line with an expected PTF\n\ncost of greater than or equal to $5M for a specified need over the course of a 5\nyear period or less.\n\n2. **Asset Condition Projects with an actual PTF cost of greater than or equal to $5M**\n\nfor a specified need over the course of a 5 year period, or less, for a specified need:\nEven if the estimated PTF costs for an Asset Condition Project were less than $5M for\na specified need, if the actual PTF expenditures are greater than or equal to $5M over\nthe course of the 5 year, or less, period, then the asset owner is required to submit a\nTCA Application and make a presentation at the PAC.\n\n3. **Example - Line work required in addition to that within the original Asset**\n\n**Condition project scope: If the asset owner determines that the scope of Project A is**\nto replace 50 structures on a single line with an expected PTF cost of $8M, then they\nare required to submit a TCA Application for review and present at the PAC. The\nproject scope calls for a construction schedule for Project A to have an expected start in\nyear X and be completed in year X+2. As construction for Project A is ongoing, the\nasset owner identifies 20 additional structures as being in need of replacement in years\nX+4 and X+5. The 20 additional structures are not considered part of the original\nscope Project A, therefore the 20 additional structures will be replaced under Project B.\nIf Project B has an expected PTF cost of $5M or greater, then a TCA Application\nsubmittal and PAC presentation will be required. If the expected PTF cost of Project B\nis less than $5M, then no TCA Application submittal or PAC presentation is required.\n\n4. **Example - Substation work required in addition to that within the original**\n\n**Asset Condition project scope: In the case of Asset Condition project located at**\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\nseveral substations where relays are being replaced with the following projected PTF\ncosts:\n\n**Station PTF Component of Project**\n\n1 $3M\n\n2 $7.5M\n\n3 $12.7M\n\n4 $4.5M\n\n5 $5.1M\n\nA TCA Application submittal and PAC presentation is required for the work at\nStations 2, 3 and 5.\n\nUnless the actual expenditures are greater than or equal to $5M, a TCA Application\nsubmittal and PAC presentation are not required for the work at Stations 1 and 4.\n\n26\n\n|Station|PTF Component of Project|\n|---|---|\n|1|$3M|\n|2|$7.5M|\n|3|$12.7M|\n|4|$4.5M|\n|5|$5.1M|\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n**Attachment H**\n\n**Guidance for Submission of TCA Applications for Projects in Flood Hazard Areas**\n\nIn order to be eligible for regional cost recovery to elevate PTF equipment, a screening test must be\nperformed in order to show that the existing sensitive PTF equipment is impacted by the current 100\nyear flood level as shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate\nMap (FEMA FIRM)[19] maps without any additional adder or sea level rise adder. In addition to the\nFEMA FIRM maps, a site specific survey that shows that the location is impacted by flooding when\nthe FEMA FIRM maps have not been updated to adequately keep up with current conditions may be\nprovided to the ISO as part of the screening test. A TCA Application for a Project that addresses\nequipment impacted by the 100 year flood level shall be accompanied by the results of this screening\ntest. Failure to provide the screening test may result in Localized Costs.\n\nRegional cost recovery for projects to elevate existing PTF equipment or to add new PTF equipment\nimpacted by the 100 year flood level shall be considered acceptable under the following conditions:\n\n   - Inland locations – defined as areas that have no chance for “wave action” on the FEMA\nFIRM map\n\n             - The elevation level is the higher of the 100 year flood level plus 3 feet or\n500 year flood level plus 1 foot\n\n   - Coastal Locations\n\n             - The elevation level is the higher of the 100 year flood level plus 3 feet or\n500 year flood level plus 1 foot\n\n             - Plus an additional 1 foot added for sea level rise[20]\n\n_Note: The costs to elevate PTF equipment higher than the above levels shall not be regionalized_\n\n   - For existing PTF equipment that is raised, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs\nrecovery to elevate the bottom of sensitive equipment[21] to the applicable elevation level\nnoted above\n\n– Example: The control cabinet of a transformer would be at the elevation listed above\n\nwhile the lower end of the transformer would be below. The bottom of the\ntransformer could be submerged in water during storm events\n\n   - For new PTF construction, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs recovery to\nelevate the bottom of the equipment to the applicable elevation level noted above\n\n– Example: The bottom of the transformer would be at the higher of the two values\n\nshown above\n\n   - For control houses, the recommendation is to allow for regional costs recovery to elevate the\ncontrol house floor to the applicable elevation level noted above for new construction for\nboth existing PTF and new PTF\n\n[19 FEMA FIRM map address search https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search)\n20 In cases where a site-specific survey initiated the work, the additional 1 foot adder for future sea level rise\ncan only be added if the survey does not already take into account future sea level rise.\n21 Sensitive equipment shall mean any equipment that cannot be submerged in water for any amount of time.\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\nPTF Cost Review\n\n_Note: The construction of a flood wall or similar in lieu of elevating equipment would be_\n_considered eligible for cost recovery if the 100 year screening test is met and the cost is_\n_equal to or less than elevating the equipment._\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\n"},
